Minto (<date when="1892">1892</date>) 1:160 inc. Tentatively dated by Scott&#x2019;s statement that he sent TC, &#x201C;in a propitiatory mood, a little book I had published containing two poems: one called &#x2018;Hades&#x2019;&#x201D; after having pbd. &#x201C;with my name in an obscure magazine, a pretended discovery, called <hi rend="italic">More Letters of Oliver Cromwell</hi>, in which the style of Oliver was satirised, and the style of Carlyle imitated&#x201D; (1:159). The parody was evidently of the Squire Papers and probably had been pbd. in <date when="1848-01">Jan.</date> or <date when="1848-02">Feb.</date> TC&#x2019;s reply to Scott&#x2019;s propitiatory gift was thus probably in early spring.

Two Poems</hi> (<date when="1838">1838</date>). Scott says that he had previously written TC a &#x201C;complimentary letter&#x201D; about <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>, which TC apparently found offensive because Scott received no reply. [In order to maintain the order established by the editors, this letter has been assiganed a document date of <date when="1848-04-01">1 April 1848</date>.]</sourceNote><head>

<p>I have read the two poems over, which fact, if you knew my habits in respect to that class of composition in these times, might itself mean something for you. I can with great sincerity bear testimony to the existence of a vigorous, genial, and truly valuable endowment in the writer.</p>

After his wife left him, <date when="1831">1831</date>, he had two common-law wives (the first d. <date when="1840">1840</date>), both called Jean and both had several children. This Jean was from Inveraray, and an appeal on behalf of the destitute &#x201C;widow and three children&#x201D; was launched by George Gilfillan (<date when="1813">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878">78</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10725"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401029-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:306</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref> and later vols.), author and Presbyterian minister at Dundee, in a letter to the <hi rend="italic">Dundee Advertiser</hi>, <date when="1848-02-29">29 Feb.</date> The letter referred to requests for support sent to several prominent persons, no doubt including TC. Jean Thom died soon after William, but a considerable sum was raised for the children; see W. Skinner, &#x201C;Biographical Sketch,&#x201D; in W. Thom, <hi rend="italic">Rhymes and Recollections</hi> (Paisley, <date when="1889">1889</date>) lxi and lxxii&#x2013;iii.</note> these, with the due Newspapers, were all that had arrived.

John called about 3 o&#x2019;clock; &#x201C;tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Irish insurrection not unlikely <hi rend="italic">to succeed</hi>&#x201D; (toohoo!),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The insurrection was still to break out; but Mitchel had already declared in the <hi rend="italic">United Irishman</hi>, <date when="1848-03-18">18 March</date>, that his object &#x201C;was to sweep this island clear of the British butchers and plant the green flag on Dublin Castle,&#x201D; and Gavan Duffy, in the same journal, <date when="1848-03-25">25 March</date>, that &#x201C;the war between the people and their English rulers has begun.&#x201D;</note> smoked a pipe, and &#x201C;took the road,&#x201D; little wiser than he came. Dinner was a basin of mutton-broth (<hi rend="italic">falsely</hi> called Scotch), with white bread, and four indifferent little carrots. Tea <hi rend="italic">pro form&#xe2;</hi>, tho&#x2019; in nearly the usual quantity. It will behove me now to go and walk a little under the mild stars. No fire; fire even at this hour would be a nuisance. Prospects of a silent night, and breakfast soon after awakening, are decidedly grateful!</p>
 <p>Tomorrow the Cap-<hi rend="italic">parcel</hi> shall be duly forwarded: meanwhile it has struck me one cap (for your sleeping in tomorrow night) may be decidedly forwarded under a penny-stamp: so here it goes.

Nowadays he spends a lot of time in the world; even Lady Harriet, the lady friend, does not always invite his wife along with him, and Mrs. Bunsen never does. That is England! I wouldn&#x2019;t put up with it if I were her!&#x201D; She adds: &#x201C;Herr Schwabe has arrived from Paris.

<p><salute>Thanks for the night cap and the note&#x2014;</salute>chiefly for the note&#x2014;my head having pretty well learnt to sleep in a handkerchief.</p>
<p>Lady Harriet does not go to London this evening&#x2014;her Opera has been knocked on the head by James bringing news of the death of Sir Thomas Baring.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Thomas Baring (<date when="1772">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">1848</date>), bart., Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s older brother and W. B. Baring&#x2019;s uncle, died, <date when="1848-04-03">3 April</date>, at Stratton Park, Winchester, after a long illness.</note> So now; instead of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> going up, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baring comes down to dinner&#x2014; Sadler<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Baring servant.</note> will bring the caps tomorrow; she having to go up for mournings&#x2014;&#x201C;black for three weeks and grey for three weeks more.&#x201D; She is also to bring a quantity of oranges, to be made into Marmalade under <hi rend="italic">my direction!</hi>&#x2014; If M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baring would <hi rend="italic">go at it</hi>&#x2014;cut the <hi rend="italic">chips</hi> and so on; <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> might make some marmalade as good as mine&#x2014;but it is not M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Atchison<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The housekeeper.</note> that will ever <hi rend="italic">choose</hi> to learn the making of marmalade any more than the making of cakes.</p>
<p>Nothing has happened except that the female ringdove has fallen sick&#x2014;and the cage is within doors to day and the door is closed, and the little house has quite a sorrow-stricken appearance&#x2014; Yesterday we were in the open air all day, walking driving, sitting&#x2014;Lady H was so tired at night that she went to bed before ten, and breakfasted in bed this morning She is now gone out on the pony, I believe, while I have had a lazy drive in the carriage&#x2014; Fleming&#x2019;s model-horse came down on the crown of its head some time ago, and broke M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baring&#x2019;s chin&#x2014; So now it is looking forward to a glancing future of <hi rend="italic">corn</hi> without <hi rend="italic">work</hi> Something was said yesterday of Charles Buller coming on Thursday &#x201C;if he could get away&#x201C;&#x2014;at all events I fondly trust he will not be able to <hi rend="italic">stay away</hi> If the quiet of today and yesterday could only last while these beautiful sunshiny days last; it would be my own fault if I did not get refreshed as by a bath of new milk&#x2014; This morning I walked half an hour, and sat sewing out of doors for a whole hour, before breakfast, without catching a headach. Kind love to John I will write to him in a day or two&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Thanks for the <foreign>bonny</foreign> little Note which lay waiting me this morning.</salute> I fell into a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> sleep, and did not awake till half past nine. A great deal of trashery lay waiting me,&#x2014;which I am not yet thro&#x2019;, tho&#x2019; it has struck one o&#x2019;clock! O the waste, the really tremendous waste, of human <hi rend="italic">time</hi> and means!&#x2014; I sat scribbling yesterday, producing nothing but <hi rend="italic">rubbish;</hi> and it is not by any means every day that I can even get that length. What use in blaming &#x201C;the world&#x201D;? It is I myself that am to blame; I and no other!</p>
<p>Darwin, as I anticipated, had gone out yesterday when I called: I sat down in the Park, which was bright and green as anything you have at Croydon, and read in the <hi rend="italic">National</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Parisian republican newspaper.</note>&#x2014;little that was edifying. The history of all Europe at present is to me the saddest,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; on the whole, decisive universal expulsion and ejection of the genus Sham-King, is <hi rend="italic">less</hi> mournful than quiescent composed satisfaction everywhere with said accursed genus; which used to be, and still is <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, the general law.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This sentence is given by Froude, who continues as if part of the same letter: &#x201C;The future for all countries fills me with a kind of horror. I have been scribbling, scribble, scribble&#x2014;alas! it will be long before that makes a book. Persist however. Anthony Sterling has sworn himself in as anti-Chartist special constable. All the people are swearing in, he says, and in considerable alarm about Monday next and the 200,000 processing petitioners&#x201D; (3:435). There was an upsurge of strong middle-class support for the govt. in the weeks just before the Chartist gathering on Kennington Common (see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480410-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1848-04-10">10 April</date></ref>), and the lord mayor of London even said in a special report that his embarassment lay in having too many constables.</note> God is great:&#x2014; but the future, for all countries, fills me with a kind of horror.&#x2014; &#x2014; Coming mournfully home from the Park, Anthony Sterling overtook me on the King&#x2019;s road; rattling half-nonsense copiously as usual; sat with me while I ate my two mutton-chops,&#x2014;during which process Fuz also entered. Full of noise, rumour, and affected kindness (not <hi rend="italic">far</hi> from real); ending in an invitation &#x201C;to meet Emerson&#x201D; some night: declined. Changes then, just at the last moment, an Omnibus passing, into a passionate, take-no-denial, invitation &#x201C;Thursday night, Carlyle, selves two!&#x201D;&#x2014; Shall I write today (for I find it comes on <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>) to say emphatically, No?&#x2014;&#x2014; Solitude is <hi rend="italic">much</hi> preferable to some kinds of noise.</p>
<p>Your Caps went up to Stanhope Street, at 10 last night; John and I carriers, by our last walk. Wills<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Baring servant.</note> told me the news.&#x2014; May the marmalade prosper; may the chief maker of it prosper! <closer><salute>Take care of yourself, dear little <pb id="pg-23-7" n="23:7"/>Jeannie; and get strong, as you promise.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
 <p>From what I know and have heard of Mr Miller,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps Hugh Miller (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856">56</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18723"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), geologist, man of letters, and ed. of the nonintrustionist, twice-weekly <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> since <date when="1840">1840</date>, for whom TC evidently had a sincere respect; see Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:280&#x2013;81, 349&#x2013;50. From being a stonemason he became an accountant, <date when="1834">1834</date>, and then a well-known writer, author of <hi rend="italic">The Old Red Sandstone</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1841">1841</date>), <hi rend="italic">Foot-prints of the Creator</hi> (<date when="1849">1849</date>), and many other works.</note> he is a man it would at any time give me pleasure to fall in with. But as to Annandale this year, I <pb id="pg-23-8" n="23:8"/>am obliged to admit that my journey thither is still altogether an affair <foreign><hi rend="italic">in nubibus</hi></foreign> [in the clouds]; uncertain as to time, nay not certain as to taking place at all: so that I fear there can be no practical calculating on such a contingency as you allude to,&#x2014;which certainly, if it did happen, I could esteem a lucky one.</p>
<p>That my poor Books have done you any good, if such be indeed the fact at the end of the account, is naturally comfortable news to me. Alas, the quantity of nonsense flying about on printed leaves, in these times, is frightful:&#x2014;and he alone has done good to a man who has taught him, not to think only, but to work a little more manfully,&#x2014;more soberly, righteously, valiantly and humbly,&#x2014;in the sight of his Maker, during his appointed days.</p>

<p><salute>Alas, my Dear, I am quite unable to write, if I even had the material of news, which I have not,&#x2014;</salute>being quite cut up today, all day; full of pains and aches; not Caliban but a cramp!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi> 5.1.</note> We got quite successfully to Town last night,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Addiscombe.</note> and I quite successfully home; where I soon roused Anne, deposited my pouring umbrella, smoked a pipe, and got to bed,&#x2014;but there it was that the Demon got me, for I could not sleep, not after various trials and appliances; my ride yesterday, too, seems to have stirred up the confusions in me:&#x2014;in short, I have lived all day without speaking twenty words hitherto; a most shivering dispirited disgraceful kind of creature (for my scribbling too wouldn&#x2019;t in the least prosper), and am more like an ancient Egyptian mummy at present than a modern living British man.</p>
<p>How can I tell you of the &#x201C;revolution,&#x201D; in these circumstances?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because of the revolutionary fires spreading across the Continent it was widely feared that a spark might ignite in England at any moment. In response to massive unemployment rather than to continental revolutionary fervor, Chartism was revived in early <date when="1848">1848</date> and a petition was circulated that allegedly received 5,706,000 signatures. On <date when="1848-04-04">4 April</date> a convention opened in London and called for a meeting, <date when="1848-04-10">10 April</date>, S of the Thames at Kennington Common, followed by a procession to Parliament to present the enormous petition. Fearing insurrection, the govt. stationed army troops, police, enrolled pensioners, and about 85,000 special constables to prevent disorder.</note> I did go out earlier than usual, to see it; or at least all buttoned up, and decided to walk myself into a glow of heat: but&#x2014;but the venomous cold wind began unexpectedly, in Cadogan place, to spit rain, and I had no umbrella! At the Burlington Arcade<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A covered passage with fashionable shops on Piccadilly, ca. 2 mi. from Cheyne Row.</note> things had grown so questionable in that respect, I <pb id="pg-23-11" n="23:11"/>resolved to step in and look at the caricatures for a few minutes; which done, I found the rain had commenced pouring; and I had nothing for it but to hail a Chelsea Omnibus, and come home again, where I still am. Judge whether I can tell you of the &#x201C;revolution&#x201C;: my sole knowledge of it is from my eyes in the above short distance, and from a kind of Official individual, a &#x201C;Paisley Lawyer bodie&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the lawyer A. H. Simpson, whom TC called &#x201C;a long-winded Paisley writer&#x201D; in <date when="1840">1840</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400715-TC-MAC-01"><sic>12:196</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1840-07-15">15 July 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> (not known to you, I think) to whom I put three words of question, and got an answer of inordinate length,&#x2014;indeed longer than I would <hi rend="italic">take</hi>, with the rain just beginning to be serious.</p>
 <p>Know however, O Goody, that there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> revolution, nor any like to be for some months or years yet; that the City of London is as safe and quiet as the Farm of Addiscombe; and that empty rumour, and &#x201C;150,000&#x201D; oaths of special constables, is hitherto the sole amount of this adventure for us. Piccadilly itself, however, told us how frightened the people were; directly at Hyde Park Corner one could see that there was something in the wind. Wellington had his iron blinds all accurately down;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The duke&#x2019;s home, Apsley House, is at Hyde Pk. Corner, at the W end of Piccadilly.</note> the Green Park was altogether shut, even the footpaths of it; the big Gates of Constitution Hill,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which leads from Buckingham Palace to Hyde Pk. Corner. Green Pk. is between Constitution Hill and Piccadilly.</note> and in the inside of these stood a score of mounted guardsmen, privately drawn up under the arch,&#x2014;dreadfully cold, I dare say. For the rest not a single fashionable carriage was on the street; not a private vehicle, but I think two surgeons&#x2019; broughams, all the way to the Egyptian Hall<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Piccadilly, used for shows and public performances.</note> omnibuses running, a few street cabs, and even a <hi rend="italic">mud-cart</hi> or two; but nothing else. The flag-pavements also nearly vacant; not a fifth of their usual population there, and those also of the strictly business kind; not a <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi> to be seen; hardly one or two of the sort called <hi rend="italic">gents.</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Would-be gentlemen.</note> &#x201C;Most myst<hi rend="italic">er</hi>us!&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420826-TC-JWC-01"><sic>15:52</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-08-26">26 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> Happily, however, the &#x201C;Paisley bodie&#x201D; explained it all to me: A meeting, some kind of meeting, had been allowed to take place at Kennington common; but Feargus O&#x2019;Connor had there warned the said meeting, that there would and should be no &#x201C;procession,&#x201D; but that everybody, under pain of broken crown, must now make for home in a detached capacity.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Feargus O&#x2019;Connor (<sic><date when="1794">1794</date></sic><corr><date when="1796">1796</date>?</corr>&#x2013;<date when="1855">1855</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20515"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish Chartist leader. The proposed procession was forbidden, and he urged his followers to disperse. The petition was then delivered in three cabs.</note> Which, said the Paisley bodie, is at this time, as an orderly has just announced at Hyde Park corner, being peaceably done. And, continued he, the people of these streets are all gone to the New Road,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >S of the Thames, in Lambeth.</note> to <pb id="pg-23-12" n="23:12"/>&#x26;c, in hopes of seeing the &#x201C;procession&#x201D; pass. And there is no procession! And&#x2014;I started off here, waving my <foreign>adieus</foreign>, and took shelter in Burlington Arcade. This, Dear, is all I know about the No-revolution we have just sustained; and if you want farther particulars, I have no doubt they are abundant and redundant in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, which of course has reached you as soon as this surprising Private Historical Account can. And so may the Lord put an end unto all cruel wars.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Carlylean tag; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360205-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:295</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1836-02-05">5 Feb. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

<p>Sir H.

 <p>Oh, my dear, be sorry for me! I am nearly out of my wits. From three o&#x2019;clock till now I have been in a tempest of twaddle. &#x2026; Just when I was about escaping into solitude and a walk through the lanes, enter D&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; and P&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;.

<p><salute>Dear Jamie,&#x2014;</salute>It is a long time since we heard anything direct from you, and almost as long since you heard from me. I have been in a state somewhat indisposed for writing, this long while; and any letters I did execute were sent generally to our Mother, who is out of your district at present.&#x2014; Isabella has from time to time sent us a little Note of your proceedings, nay Jamie the Younger<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle (b. <date when="1835">1835</date>), son of James and Isabella.</note> is now up to writing: all these Notes I have seen; and return due thanks for them on my own score.</p>
<p>We have had a most sickly uncomfortable Spring in this quarter; the wettest, too, and muddiest for the husbandmen that I have seen since I came to live here. Grain is still cheap, they say; but the seedtime is admitted to be and to have been very bad, which, unless times alter, must infallibly raise prices. In Bedfordshire, a Gentleman tells me, they have had to <hi rend="italic">dibble</hi> their wheat, instead of drilling it; no horse could brook such a soft element. The Spring wheats and barleys, however, they say (and indeed my own observation confirms it) look all well. Most of our potatoes seem to be, and indeed to have all along been, in a <hi rend="italic">spoiled</hi> condition, the old disease still present in them; even the half sound ones, moreover, are excessively dear. As seed is likely to be a little more attainable in <pb id="pg-23-16" n="23:16"/>Annandale this year, I suppose you will plant a few; <hi rend="italic">many</hi> is by no means to be recommended, now or, I doubt, in coming years.&#x2014; &#x2014; We heard also of the new Gig, which our Mother and you had purchased; of which indeed we were very glad. How lucky that the last old <foreign><hi rend="italic">clatch</hi></foreign> did not lame some of you when it gave way! No <hi rend="italic">clatch</hi> in our time was more thoroughly worn out before being quitted. Moreover, from the first, it was a bad one. Good luck to us all with this!&#x2014; &#x2014; Alas, we heard also of poor Mrs Howatson; how her lingering misery had ended as all earthly sorrow has to end! I suppose her own disease was from the first incurable.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471019-TC-JC-01">TC to JC, <date when="1847-10-19">19 Oct. 1847</date></ref>.</note> None could wish it lengthened out beyond the appointment;&#x2014;and so we have to say again, Farewell. Poor Jean, I remember her from my earliest boyhood; she was one of the few figures that still survived for me out of that time; and it is still rather as a bright gay child than as a sick elderly woman that I remember her.&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Doctor continues busy here; making way resolutely, tho&#x2019; I think rather <hi rend="italic">slowly.</hi> However, he seems much happier than he used to be; and his task does draw to an end. As for myself, I have but a poor account to give: the spring weather, I imagine, does not specially agree with me more than with others; this and many things more <hi rend="italic">against</hi> one, not in one&#x2019;s favour! What is worst of all, however,&#x2014;were it not remediable,&#x2014;is that one sees no work going on; none hitherto;&#x2014;which indeed is definable as the worst suffering of all. However, a new Book <hi rend="italic">is</hi> perhaps getting upon the stocks; tho&#x2019; I fear there will be a terrible time before it come off yet: without a struggle,&#x2014;yes a bit of a struggle,&#x2014;it will clearly <hi rend="italic">never</hi> come off! That is the law of the case.</p>
<p>Jane went on a visit to the place called Addiscombe (whither we often go) almost a fortnight ago: she has a beautiful Spring scene all round her, a beautiful house, and is very quiet (only the Lady and herself there for most part); so that I expect she will return somewhat set up again: it is but ten miles off; I have been out twice, and found her very well <hi rend="italic">considering.</hi> She has been but feckless ever since Newyearsday time.</p>
<p>I fear there is but little chance of <hi rend="italic">Satter;</hi> little chance for me of an Annandale habitation anywhere. Do you know &#x201C;the Norwood&#x201D; in Milk-valley? I see it advertised for sale.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1848-04-04">4 April</date>, advertised it for sale as a &#x201C;new and commodious&#x201D; &#x201C;Mansion House,&#x201D; with about 100 acres.</note> I wish you could examine it, house, ground &#x26;c (especially the <hi rend="italic">house</hi>) some day when you have leisure, and learn for me what kind of sum the people expect for it.&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Jamie: good be with you and all yours.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was perhaps lying low while JWC was away, which would account for B&#xF6;lte&#x2019;s writing to Varnhagen, <date when="1848-04-15">15 April</date>: &#x201C;I am longing for Carlyle&#x2019;s return. It would also be nice while they are away to have some other acquaintance. Also I am longing to tell him what you have said about present-day conditions; for nobody puts it the way you do. He understands [spoken German] so badly, that I have to repeat every sentence for him six times.&#x201D; And on <date when="1848-05-07">7 May</date> she wrote: &#x201C;It is surprising how few people come to see him now!

I always find him entertaining, except when I have to play for him on his out-of-tune piano, which he has a passion for, although he can&#x2019;t tell one melody from another&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 61, trans.).</note> <closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>I will certainly come on Tuesday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson refused, <date when="1848-04-10">10 April</date>, Forster&#x2019;s invitation to dine with him and TC on <date when="1848-04-13">13 April</date> because he had a prior engagement &#x201C;to dine with Mr Wedgwood, who also added the hope of Mr &#x26; Mrs Carlyle&#x2019;s company&#x201D; (Rusk 4:52). Apparently TC&#x2019;s letter is in reply to a second invitation, for Tues., <date when="1848-04-18">18 April</date>, so in the end Emerson dined with Forster alone (see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480419-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, [ca. <date when="1848-04-19">19 April</date>]</ref>).</note>&#x2014;unless this villainous little devil of a sore-throat (the development and outcome of much biliary misery in me) should spread beyond expectation. But indeed I have been in an unusually poor way of late, in regard to this poor clay house of mine,&#x2014;God mend it! Or at least, Let me get my bit of work done in it, and then <hi rend="italic">end</hi> it; which will amount to much the same!&#x2014;</p>
 <p>Why not get Dickens too? Emerson wishes much to see him; and I also, much oftener than falls to my lot.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC, Emerson, Dickens, and Forster dined together, <date when="1848-04-25">25 April</date>; see <hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 5:276. Emerson wrote to his wife, <date when="1848-05-04">4 May</date>, that he found Dickens &#x201C;cordial and sensible. Carlyle dined there also, and it seemed the habit of the set to pet Carlyle a great deal, and draw out the mountainous mirth. The pictures which such people together give one of what is really going forward in private &#x26; in public life, are inestimable&#x201D; (Rusk 4:66). In his notebook Emerson wrote of the dinner and spelled out what was &#x201C;really going forward&#x201C;: &#x201C;Forster, who has an obstreperous cordiality, received Carlyle with loud salutation, &#x2018;My Prophet!&#x2019; Forster called Carlyle&#x2019;s passion, Musket-worship. There were only gentlemen present, &#x26; the conversation turned on the shameful lewdness of London streets at night. (Carlyle said, &#x26; the others agreed, that chastity for men was as good as given up in Europe.) &#x2018;I hear it,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;I hear whoredom in the House of Commons. Disraeli betrays whoredom, &#x26; the whole H. of Commons universal incontinence, in every word they say.&#x2019; &#x2026; C. &#x26; D. [said], that chastity in the male sex was as good as gone in our times; &#x26;, in England, was so rare, that they could name all the exceptions. Carlyle evidently believed that the same things were true in America&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Journals and Notebooks</hi> 10:550&#x2013;51).</note> Mrs C. I compute will be here on Saturday Ev<hi rend="italic">g:</hi> on Sunday or afterwards, right glad to see you.</p>
<p>I have finished <hi rend="italic">Goldsmith:</hi> it is capital, equally good to the end: <foreign><hi rend="italic">euge</hi></foreign> [bravo]! That really is what I say. Except <hi rend="italic">Boswell&#x2019;s</hi> there is no Biography in the English language worth naming beside it.&#x2014; Do you want the Volume back, or was that a mistake? Henry shall have his choice, yes or no, today.</p>
<p>Finally, can you tell me (<hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>, by return of post), what are the duties of a Steward at the Literary Fund Dinner?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The fifty-ninth anniversary dinner of the Royal Literary Fund (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460823-JWC-TC-01"><sic>21:24</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1846-08-23">23 Aug. 1846</date></corr></ref>) was held at the Freemasons&#x2019; Tavern, <date when="1848-05-10">10 May</date>.</note> Any duty, except that of paying 3 guineas if they are not already members? Pray explain. The <pb id="pg-23-20" n="23:20"/>people have very civilly invited me; and I do not wish to refuse without at least understanding the question.</p>
<p>Hervey seems to be a kind of <hi rend="italic">evaporated</hi> Walpole;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hervey (<date when="1696">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1743">1743</date>), Baron Hervey of Ickworth, English politician and writer; satirized as Sporus in Pope&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot;</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of George II</hi>, ed.

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>It is late to thank you for the pretty little mats&#x2014;later than even an unusual amount of headachs could have excused, had not M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. in the meanwhile conveyed my &#x201C;favourable sentiments.&#x201D; He has probably told you also the fact of my absence for two weeks. I returned from Addiscombe last Saturday, very little <hi rend="italic">set up</hi> either in mind or body by my fortnight of dignified idleness. The coldness of the weather prevented my going much into the open air, and within doors the atmosphere at Addiscombe is much more <hi rend="italic">chilly</hi> than at Cheyne Row. But it is morally good for one, now and then, to fling oneself into circumstances in which one <hi rend="italic">must</hi> exert oneself, and consume one&#x2019;s own smoke, even under the pressure of physical ailment. The more I see of wealthy establishments however, the less I wish to preside over one of my own&#x2014;the superior splendour is overbalanced by the inferior comfort: and the only indisputable advantage of a large fortune&#x2014;the power of helping other people with it&#x2014;all these rich people, however good and generous their hearts may have been in the beginning, seem somehow <hi rend="italic">enchanted</hi> into never availing themselves of.</p>
<p>I found Carlyle in a bad way, complaining of sore throat and universal <pb id="pg-23-22" n="23:22"/>misery, and in this state nothing I could say hindered him from walking out in the rain&#x2014;and his throat became so much worse during the night that I was afraid he was going to be as ill as when poor Becker attended him at Comely Bank.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Ferdinand Wilhelm Becker (<date when="1805">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834">34</date>); see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280201-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:317</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-02-01">1 Feb. 1828</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18271202-TC-FWB-01"><sic>12:386&#x2013;88</sic><corr>TC to FWB, <date when="1827-12-02">2 Dec. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> He had asked a gentleman to dinner on Sunday and two more to tea&#x2014;Dodds and John Hunter of Edinr&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">two more</hi> came &#x201C;on the voluntary principle&#x201C;&#x2014;and all these men <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had to receive and entertain, on my own basis, and to show me, I suppose, that they were not too much mortified in finding only me, the unfortunate creatures all staid till eleven at night<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Espinasse recalls an occasion, when TC was away (probably <date when="1849-07">July 1849</date>), with Hunter and Dodds, who &#x201C;suddenly breaking into the quiet conversation &#x2026; startled his hostess and his fellow-visitors by a tirade in favour of the insurgent Hungarians, which was violent in language, and delivered in a tone of voice far louder than was generally heard in that establishment, unless when Carlyle himself was the speaker&#x201D; (258). The two uninvited guests are unidentified.</note>&#x2014;then I put a mustard blister to the mans throat, and put him to bed with apprehensions enough&#x2014;but to my astonishment he went almost immediately to sleep, and slept quite peaceably all night and next morning the throat was miraculously mended.

<dateline><place>Chelsea</place>, Wednesday, <date when="1848-04-26">26 April, 1848</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>Surely, however busy I may be, it is possible for me to write you a little word, and pay a penny for it, to satisfy your friendly anxieties about us! That is a thing I ought to do;&#x2014;and a thing I will do, this blessed hour, before going out to my walking.</p>
<p>We had a little Note from Jenny two days ago; which gave us good and evil news of your ongoings at Dumfries: news, on the whole, which we should be thankful for, since it reports you still stirring about, tho&#x2019; very frail. No wonder you are frail: this wild fierce spring weather, the hardest I can remember almost, is enough to put a stronger figure out of sorts. Jenny&#x2019;s poor little Lasses, too, have had an attack of scarlet-fever, it would seem; a sad anxiety to her, no doubt, and to you too, while it lasted. Indeed <pb id="pg-23-23" n="23:23"/>we could have wished you in some other house, while that bad business went on. But we hope, on all accounts, it is now over; and the poor little <foreign>Bairns</foreign> got to their feet again.</p>
<p>We are all tolerably well here. I forget if I wrote to you that Jane went off, for <supplied>[two]</supplied> weeks to the Country-house of our friends the Barings: a beautiful little place they have, some <supplied>[ten]</supplied> miles from this: I took her out in a carriage, and sent a carriage to bring her <supplied>[home]</supplied>-<supplied>[tak?]</supplied>ing everything &#x201C;genteelly&#x201D; among the quality people,&#x2014;besides going out in the middle <supplied>[of the visit]</supplied> to pay my own compliments for a day: the thing seems to have done very well; and our <supplied>[own]</supplied> little Goodwife looks decidedly better ever since she came home. She is gone out at this moment; the first time these several days, the weather having lately been wet as well as wintry cold. She wrote one day, I think to Jean.&#x2014; <supplied>[about four words missing]</supplied> Jean was transacting her <supplied>[two missing lines]</supplied> go too deeply into the bustle, dear Mother; endeavour to keep at the outside, and let younger hands take hold of the load.&#x2014; &#x2014; I myself, soon after Jane returned from Addiscombe, caught a dirty little villain of a sore-throat; which threatened to grow into a serious kind of thing for a day or two days (I remembered the Comley Bank one, of twenty years back, which you witnessed); but by taking vigorous measures, the enemy <hi rend="italic">decamped</hi>, quite of a sudden; and, I think, has left me really better than I before was for some time. I am trying what I can to <hi rend="italic">get into work;</hi> fagging, and haggling, and as it were falling asleep upon my tools,&#x2014;alas, it is a terrible business for me to get <hi rend="italic">kindled</hi>, and not much of a business to burn either, when I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> kindled! However, we must struggle along; and prevail at last, one way or the other, as we hope.&#x2014; Jack is very well; drawing towards the end of his <hi rend="italic">Dante;</hi> which however continues a <foreign><hi rend="italic">driegh</hi></foreign> [tedious] heavy job for him to the last. Whatever become of <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, he himself has got a visible improvement out of it: and indeed, I do believe, it will be found a piece of work <hi rend="italic">rightly done</hi>, whoever may examine it; and that is all one can want.</p>
<p>We have had our Chartist affairs here too, which alarmed some people, but not <supplied>[us]</supplied> in the least; in fact nothing could be more tame than the whole business proved, such an over<supplied>[whel]</supplied>ming shew was made against it: I suppose, it will appear in another <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> next <supplied>[time, b]</supplied>ut that it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> appear again, and also again, and ever till there are new measures <supplied>[to deal]</supplied> with the miseries of the people, I do expect:&#x2014;however, we have testified (what is very val<supplied>[ua]</supplied>ble meanwhile) that &#x201C;insurrection,&#x201D; barricades, pikes and street-fighting, is by no means the plan we can accept here.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; Dear Mother, my paper is come to an end, and my time too; tho&#x2019; there are still many things to be said,&#x2014;which I hope speedily to take another day <supplied>[page torn]</supplied> that may detain it till <hi rend="italic">tomorrow.</hi> <supplied>[page torn]</supplied> care of [page torn]</p>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>I have jammed these two unfortunate Articles into a kind of combination. Too long, I am afraid;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster agreed, divided the essay into two pts., and pbd. them as indicated above. The two articles are rptd. in <hi rend="italic">Rescued Essays</hi>, ed. Percy Newberry (<date when="1892">1892</date>) 17&#x2013;52, 53&#x2013;69.</note> but if you can publish them in whole today, I shall have done with the thing and feel my heart a little easier.</p>
<p>As the matter stands at present it is one Article; but if you like better it can easily be made <hi rend="italic">two:</hi> divide it at the present &#x201C;white line&#x201D; (and really I think that might be better); let the first continue to be called &#x201C;Irish repeal,&#x201D; and call the second &#x201C;English repeal&#x201C;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is sarcastic in &#x201C;Repeal of the Union&#x201D; about those who believe that Repeal is the &#x201C;one thing wanted to make that Ireland happy&#x201D; (Newberry 17), and still more about those of the governing class who &#x201C;sit still in the middle of all that, and say &#x2018;Peace, peace&#x2019;&#x201D; (21). He also writes forcibly that if Ireland could be bodily removed, then England would have no need of it; but since that is impossible, so is Repeal. Ireland had no more hope of conquering England than a rat could &#x201C;bar the way of a rhinoceros&#x201D; (43). Therefore, a realistic and peaceable solution must be found. The second article called on Irish landlords to act: &#x201C;[A]ll of us thank God for the merciful destruction of the potato (much as we love that tragic vegetable when well boiled); and, in pious silence, worshipping the decrees of Heaven, perceive that with the potato rotten, Irish existence can no longer, by any human cunning, be maintained in the hideous quiet chronic state&#x201D; (61). He called for the enactment of the &#x201C;Sale of Encumbered Estates Bill for Ireland&#x201D; (55), yet already saw that, with wasted time, &#x201C;the rapids of Niagara &#x2026; become too rapid&#x201D; (69).</note> that could really be done. Furthermore there is this to be said, If the first Article be not published <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the other, it cannot be published at all;&#x2014;and really I could wish they went together, and I were fairly rid of them.</p>
<p>Finally,&#x2014;I do not think there will be any more <hi rend="italic">corrections:</hi> but if you send me the sheets, I shall be at home all this ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, and will run over them one other time: failing this, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are to do it, and be responsible that no nonsense glide thro. Put &#x201C;C.&#x201D; to both articles; and modify what is said <hi rend="italic">atop</hi>, if you like,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I think it will do.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received your Letter; and beg to express again my thankfulness for the anxious attention you bestow on my American affairs. To what of new your Letter contains I can only give the old answer: That I trust entirely to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in these matters; and neither have had, nor desire to have, your judgement interfered with, in regard to them, at all; but request simply that you will manage them as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like,&#x2014;and only report to me at rare intervals, or indeed only when some money-result is arrived at (if that should ever happen), for my confidence in you, I must say and repeat, is perfect, at once, and <hi rend="italic">exclusive.</hi> Let this suffice.</p>
<p>With Messrs W. and Putnam I have had no correspondence whatever, except writing a receipt for their Draft when it came to hand (some &#xa3;70 or so, if I rem<supplied>[em]</supplied>ber);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> to which acknowledgement I appended two or three words, expressing my surprise at the smallness of the sum, my decided notion that our Bargain ought to try and get itself <hi rend="italic">literally</hi> fulfilled, if it could!&#x2014;and for the rest, my one wish and resolution, to abide by whatever you should do or decide in regard to the affair. This and an insignificant &#x201C;circular&#x201D; received last night (to which I do not design any reply whatever) is all the correspondence I have had with W. and Putnam; nor do I desire or intend to have any more;&#x2014;but do earnestly request you to have it in my stead, if you will be so good!</p>
<p>In short, with regard to those Bibliopolic Gentlemen, my opinion is altogether like your own; and I begin to regret very heartily that I ever bothered myself correcting my Books for them, or addressing Notices to their honest fellow citizens of the Union on <hi rend="italic">their</hi> behalf,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Certifying that TC had authorized the printing of the books; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460430-TC-RWE-01"><sic>20:184</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1846-04-30">30 April 1846</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460616-JWC-HW-01"><sic>203</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1846-06-16">16 June 1846</date></corr></ref>. For the initial confusion over Wiley &#x26; Putnam&#x2019;s publishing an American edn. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451111-TC-RWE-01"><sic>20:52&#x2013;53</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1845-11-11">11 Nov. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and did not rather leave them to their own questionable course as <hi rend="italic">Privateers</hi> (we must not say Pirates); and so save myself an infinitude of negociation, and confused unpleasant trouble, to myself and my friends, on the subject.</p>
<p>I should of course like very ill to <hi rend="italic">spend</hi> more money upon such a set of interests: but I do not much expect ever to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> any real sum of money out of this affair; so that, except theoretically, it has become as good as indifferent to me. And now, my dear Sir, if <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, within limits of the utmost funds thus at your disposal and as good as worth nothing to me, can see means of <pb id="pg-23-26" n="23:26"/>defraying the trouble it will take to bring these &#x201C;Privateers&#x201D; rigorously to book, I bid you, in the interests of Justice, Do it; I should be glad it were done, and the money-result for me <hi rend="italic">nothing.</hi> But if the funds will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> remunerate such a trouble, or if you disincline to prosecute so poor an affair farther, then pray let it go,&#x2014;and let the Privateers (<hi rend="italic">without</hi> Letter-of-Marque) go; and <hi rend="italic">prosecute</hi> their voyage to the Devil, I, for one, heeding them no more!&#x2014; &#x2014; This really is my mind; and I once again bid you act on it, and consider yourself now and at all times as my <hi rend="italic">plenipotentiary</hi> and second self in regard to that Putnam matter</p>
<p>Emerson is here; a great favourite with us all; and, I think, will certainly lecture before he quit London. We are all full of revolutions in this Europe; but have not yet got to street-barricades in England,&#x2014;nor indeed think we shall!</p>
<p><closer><salute>Believe me, my Dear Sir, / Yours much obliged</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>The Enclosed I promised sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be shewn to you, offered to you, not that you w<hi rend="italic">d insert</hi> the printed part of it. M&#x2019;Cormac I once saw: a big sagacious Scotch-looking Dr, who has written some philosophic Books; I believe, a man of weight and repute in Belfast.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry M&#x2019;Cormac (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886">1886</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17398"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Belfast physician and author of medical works; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430613-TC-CAH-01"><sic>16:195</sic><corr>TC to CAH, <date when="1843-06-13">13 June 1843</date></corr></ref>. M&#x2019;Cormac wrote to TC from Belfast, <date when="1848-05-01">1 May</date>: &#x201C;I read with pain, as coming from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, the letter in last Examiner [&#x201C;Repeal of the Union,&#x201D; <date when="1848-04-29">29 April</date>]. The produce of this country is sent out of it, in order to be sold &#x26; pay the <hi rend="italic">absentee</hi> landlord. &#x2026; Thus capital in every form is abstracted, <hi rend="italic">leaving insufficient for the</hi> comfortable subsistence of the people. Hence, <hi rend="italic">misery, discontent, &#x26; wholesale Starvation</hi>. &#x2026; The accompanying communication [not found] printed for my own convenience was sent to most of the London Journals: I am unaware that it received insertion or attention. The same also of a subsequent, &#x26; perhaps more impressible, letter addressed to the Times. / I can assure you D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Sir, that discontent&#x2014;a discontent that slashing philippics will hardly appease&#x2014;is likewise very rife in the North of Ireland.&#x201C;
<lb/>
<lb/>TC presumably answered this letter, whereupon M&#x2019;Cormac responded by enclosing a letter addressed to the ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, dated <date when="1848-05-05">5 May</date> and signed &#x201C;M.,&#x201D; which was printed in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-05-13">13 May</date>. The writer of the letter, identifying himself as one of TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;earliest admirers,&#x201D; took exception to TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;judgment on the question of Irish Repeal. &#x2026; It is good government that should be agitated for, not separate government; but separation is better than bad government; and I entirely sympathize in the indignation which an Irishman is entitled to feel at the reasons given by [TC] for refusing it. / The doctrine of your correspondent is (to quote his own words) that &#x2018;the Destinies have laid upon England a heavier, terribler job of labour than any people has been saddled with in these generations&#x2019;&#x2014;no other than that of &#x2018;conquering Anarchy&#x2019;: that this, which is &#x2018;England&#x2019;s work, appointed her by the so-called Destinies and Divine Providences,&#x2019; cannot go on unless Ireland is either English, or in English hands; and that consequently the repeal of the Union is &#x2018;flatly forbidden by the laws of the universe.&#x2019; / &#x2026; Instead of telling of the sins and errors of England, and warning her of &#x2018;wrath to come,&#x2019; as he has been wont to do, he preaches the divine Messiahship of England, proclaims her the prime minister of Omnipotence on this earth, commissioned to reduce it all (or as much of as is convenient to herself) into order and harmony, or at all events, under that pretext, into submission, even into &#x2018;slavery,&#x2019; under her own power&#x2014;will it or will it not.&#x201D; See also Rodger L. Tarr, &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle and Henry M&#x2019;Cormac: Two Letters on the Condition of Ireland in <date when="1848">1848</date>,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Studies in Scottish Literature</hi> 5 (<date when="1967">1967</date>&#x2013;<date when="1968">68</date>): 253&#x2013;56.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-23-27" n="23:27"/>There ought to be <hi rend="small-caps">another</hi> equally ferocious Article, one on Lord Johnny and his duties! Dare you? Nay I fear it will be too <hi rend="italic">big</hi> (were there no other fault) for being got in at all.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the event the article did prove too long, and TC was forced to divide it into two parts. One part appeared as &#x201C;Ireland and the British Chief Governor&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, <date when="1848-05-13">13 May</date>. Another part, &#x201C;Legislation for Ireland,&#x201D; was printed in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-05-13">13 May</date>. Both excoriate the prime minister for dealing with the most pressing matters in Ireland by urging measures inadequate to the situation. In the former, TC says: &#x201C;By what means, then, <hi rend="italic">are</hi> Irish wrongs to be redressed? Fifty thousand armed soldiers,&#x2014; &#x2026; here is prohibition of Repeal treason, but here is no cure of the disease which produces Repeal treason, and other madnesses and treasons among us.&#x201D; In the latter essay TC begins by asking, &#x201C;[W]hat has become of the Sale of Encumbered Estates Bill for Ireland? Surely in the front rank, as a preliminary to all other bills, the Minister was bound to have got that bill passed. It is the preliminary and foundation-stone of all Irish arrangements whatsoever.&#x201D; And he ends by insisting that the chief minister should see that steps are &#x201C;taken, and that soon. These weeks and months are precious, are perhaps priceless; rushing swiftly,&#x2014;everyone asks, Whitherward? The rapids of Niagara, after a while, become too rapid; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> there is no oaring or steering!&#x201D;</note> But it must be written,&#x2014;and somewhere or somehow sent into the light.</p>
<p>Tell me what is the <hi rend="italic">latest</hi> Printer-hour for this week: friday morning?&#x2014; Tell me&#x2014;in fact cannot you come down to me tomorrow ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> for half an hour, or appoint some rendezvous midway about 4 o&#x2019;clock;&#x2014;for I want much to see both on this and on &#x201C;the general question.&#x201D;</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You have manfully and earnestly spoken forth the undeniable truth in that Paper upon the Irish;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His latest pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Scotland for the Scotch: or Reasons for Irish Repeal by a Scot of the Old School</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1848">1848</date>), a rptd. letter, dated <date when="1848-03-20">20 March</date>, to the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Reformers&#x2019; Gazette</hi>, against the employment of Irish laborers, &#x201C;pestiferous hordes,&#x201D; in Scotland. It ended: &#x201C;It is high time &#x2026; for Scotsmen &#x2026; to resume the management of their own affairs into their own hands, as their fathers did, when they had neither English kings nor English parliaments to fetter, plunder, and overawe them!&#x201D; For TC&#x2019;s thoughts on the Irish invasion, see &#x201C;The Finest Peasantry in the World,&#x201D; ch. 4 of <hi rend="italic">Chartism, Works</hi> 29:138ff, where &#x201C;crowds of miserable Irish darken all our towns.&#x201D;</note> and no candid man but must sympathize with <pb id="pg-23-28" n="23:28"/>all your feelings on the subject. To me, ever since I opened my eyes upon the world, or began to think of my native country and its interests, precisely the same sorrowful indignation at the sight of this continuous irresistible &#x201C;Invasion by Irish Beggary&#x201D; has been familiar; and I have, wherever there was opportunity, given expression to it very much like your own.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Steill had ended his <hi rend="italic">P.

We must all end, otherwise!&#x2014; If I thought that &#x201C;native Parliaments,&#x201D; or indeed any kind of Parliaments, and Public Babblements (for such they all are in these sad times), could do us any good, or in fact could do other than <hi rend="italic">unlock</hi> the doors of Chaos (doors now nearly <hi rend="italic">broken</hi>, at any rate), and give Anarchy a tongue,&#x2014;I too should vote strenuously for native Parliaments, Nationalities &#x26;c &#x26;c both in Scotland and Ireland: but I fear there lies no hope for us at all in that direction,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it seems likely enough, we (as the whole world is now doing) shall first <hi rend="italic">try</hi> by that. God help us! We have a heavy burden, of natural infatuation, of natural stupid cowardice and absurd extinct <hi rend="italic">tradition</hi>, to make our way under at present.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read your <hi rend="italic">Observations on Tenant-Right</hi>, with much approval so far as I can understand the matter; thanks to you for sending this Pamphlet, and for the other friendly things you express to me.</p>
<p>It is greatly to be desired that persons of sense and veracity of mind, acquainted with Irish Agriculture and the nature of things, should consult with all earnestness as to what is now to be done with that unhappy land and people! Evidently there is nothing wanted but a good and just discernment as to this; for if land and people <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be brought into the true relation to one another, it seems admitted that there are ample resources there for them all; that there need not be, at this hour, one idle man in Ireland who could handle his spade or hoe, and was willing to work. It is a tremendous reflexion that this should be the possible fact, and that the actual one is what we see!</p>
<p>I think it a pity the L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Lieutenant himself,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Clarendon.</note> or some other eminent man or body of men in Ireland, did not very soon call together, by his own summons, a competent number of Practical Rational Persons, such as you, from all quarters of Ireland,&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> &#x201C;Irish Parliament,&#x201D; and Convocation of the Notables;&#x2014;and (carefully excluding every Newspaper Reporter, and binding every member to strict discretion or even silence as to what sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be <pb id="pg-23-30" n="23:30"/>said there), ask them, in the name of God that made us all, and bade us all be just and wise, not iniquitous, negligent and mad, What <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be done to bring these famishing Irishmen into contact with that fruitful uncultivated or miscultivated Irish land? Can <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> be done? Does human ingenuity, which has invented steamships and found out the law of the Stars, quite fail in this limited terrestrial problem? I will not believe it;&#x2014;it must be human courage only, and human determination to justice, that fails!&#x2014; We are getting into fearful conditions on this side of the Water too, if nothing be done. The Streets of London itself are getting studded with Irish Beggars more thickly every day; presenting the &#x201C;Irish Problem,&#x201D; which no Legislator will take up, to the British Community at large with intimation that they must either solve it, or sink along with it to worse than death!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday being very hard up for time, I sent you one of the shortest Letters along with Alick&#x2019;s, and promised you a longer one for today, which promise I am now to fulfil. I dated yesterday&#x2019;s Letter &#x201C;Friday,&#x201D; but found afterwards, on considering a little, that it was really &#x201C;Thursday&#x201C;: so you get this a day sooner than I calculated on there.&#x2014; I have been far too long in writing; but could not well help it either; and my good Mother, I know will excuse me, as she always does.</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s Letter has been unusually long upon the road. I find there is some paltry village or other not many miles from him, which they call &#x201C;London&#x201C;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ontario.</note> two of his Letters now have been sent first <hi rend="italic">thither;</hi> and there they lie till it <supplied>[is]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> clear nobody will have them, and are <hi rend="italic">then</hi> sent off! I will tell him how to rectify this in future. Nor does he yet seem to know that there is a mail <hi rend="italic">weekly</hi> at present to Britain.&#x2014; One is very glad, however, on any terms, to learn that he and his, poor fellow, are getting on tolerably well.</p>
<p>We were all much concerned a short time ago to hear that our poor Mother was so considerably out of order. Jenny&#x2019;s Letters reassured us a little; but we see clearly that you are very frail, dear Mother; and what can we do in this but call upon you to be doubly careful of yourself, if alas that could do us any good! I will ask and request of Jenny also,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I know she needs no bidding. But I have often thought, and said, that you are far too indifferent about your diet and treatment; and I am persuaded a considerable improvement is really possible if you would take more care in that respect. Jenny knows well already that she cannot in any way so much oblige me as by doing you any service: she has it in her power, while you are beside her, to make me really her debtor in one of the most important respects, as in fact no other can! So I will lay once more my strict charges on you <hi rend="italic">both;</hi> and trust that now, with the summer weather, we shall hear rather better accounts before long.</p>
<p>This I think has been a very bad season for health over all the world: hereabouts there has been the hardest and especially the most changeful <pb id="pg-23-32" n="23:32"/>weather I have ever seen in these parts, which in a certain degree, tho&#x2019; not wholly either, may account for the great sickliness there has been. In the very end of <date when="1848-03">March</date>, for example, or beginning of April, we had, this year, instead of the old-established &#x201C;borrowing-days,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last three days of <date when="1848-03">March</date>, reputedly noted for bad weather.</note> some three or four of the most blazing and really oppressively <hi rend="italic">hot</hi> days; which again soon gave place to bitter grey or rainy north-east winds, very unfavourable for all things and persons; and when at last the real summer came, and we had (ever since the beginning of May) the beautifullest clear genial days and nights, and on Wednesday last I had put on my final summer-clothes (white hat, and black <hi rend="italic">cobwebs</hi> of I know not what name), behold! there comes another change, colder and colder, and today I am wrapt in my thick winter-dressinggown again, and Jane down stairs has been obliged to kindle a brisk fire in spite of her scoured grate! But the wind today, in spite of its cold, is all out of the South, and I still prophesy we are to have rain; which will be well worth suffering on other accounts.</p>
<p>Poor old Mr Buller,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Buller, Sr.</note>&#x2014;I know not if I ever told you how weak and unwell he had grown: an attack of apoplexy above a year ago almost quite ruined him: and now it is all over; he died the day before yesterday, at a place called Richmond where they had taken a house, some 7 miles <supplied>[west]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> of this. It will be a sad loss to poor Mrs Buller, who is herself too one of the weakliest creatures I ever saw living: I think she will not long survive him; for he was the chief care she had.&#x2014;&#x2014; Another death that we are interested by is that of poor Lord Ashburton, concerning whom you might perhaps notice a rascally article in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, one day. It is the same Lord Ashburton at whose big mansion, &#x201C;the Grange,&#x201D; you have sometimes known me: Alverstoke, where his son and son&#x2019;s wife sometimes entertained us, was another house of his. His death was somewhat sudden; a kind of ague caught a<supplied>[t his]</supplied><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter and word omitted.</note> daughter&#x2019;s house where he was on a visit,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton, died <date when="1848-05-13">13 May</date>, at Longleat, the seat of his da., the marchioness of Bath, in Wiltshire, after a few days&#x2019; illness. The long obituary in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1848-05-15">15 May</date>, speaks of him as &#x201C;the only man created a peer whose principal pursuit in life was commerce&#x201D; and as &#x201C;a man with very slender talents for oratory or legislation.&#x201D; Though critical, the account recalls his part in making the Ashburton-Webster treaty with the United States, <date when="1842">1842</date> (see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420213-TC-TSS-01"><sic>14:42</sic><corr>TC to TSS, <date when="1842-02-13">13 Feb. 1842</date></corr></ref>), and says that in private life he was reported to be &#x201C;pre-eminently amiable.&#x201D;</note> since that warm weather began: he is to be buried this day,&#x2014;and his big hospitable house, near which he is to lie, will now know him no more. What is remarkable enough, his two brothers, one elder and another younger, had already <pb id="pg-23-33" n="23:33"/>died within a month;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Thomas Baring, bart., the oldest brother, d. <date when="1848-04-03">3 April</date>; Henry Baring (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">1848</date>), the youngest brother, d. <date when="1848-04-03">13 April</date>.</note> and now the three old men, after many wanderings over the world, have all concluded their pilgrimage, and as it were lain down to rest <hi rend="italic">together.</hi>&#x2014; The now Lord Ashburton (Mr Baring, our friend) is, as his father was, a very worthy man; and I hope will do good in his day and generation, as at least he has a real desire to do: he is now immensely <hi rend="italic">rich;</hi> but, having no children, and for himself no silly vanity, I believe does not in the least rejoice at such a lot: poor fellow, he looked miserably ill the day I called on him after his return from the sad scene, and, tho&#x2019; we did not speak of that, I found him miserably thin and pale, and the picture of a sorrow which well became him. One could not but ask oneself again, thinking of 60 thousand a year: &#x201C;Alas, what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the use of it?&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310500-TC-WG-01"><sic>5:268</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1831-05-01">1 May 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> Perhaps about this hour he is laying his father&#x2019;s head in the grave.</p>
<p>As for us, we have not suffered much from the bad weather; Jane, while the sun continued shining, had even got quite strong (for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>), tho&#x2019; now she is a little shrunk in again. I have been writing some other &#x201C;Articles,&#x201D; as you would see in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Spectator:</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Legislation for Ireland,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-05-13">13 May</date>; &#x201C;Ireland and the British Chief Governor&#x201D; and &#x201C;Irish Regiments (of the New &#xc6;ra),&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, <date when="1848-05-13">13 May</date>.</note> by the bye, will you send these on to Alick, if you still have them at hand? Also if the Article on <hi rend="italic">Louis Philippe</hi> (a good while back) is anywhere in your possession, would Jenny clip it accurately out, mark the <hi rend="italic">date</hi> of it on the margin, and send it me. Jane had a copy here, but has by mistake parted with it, and now there is none to be had readily. If you have it not, however, then don&#x2019;t in the least mind.&#x2014; I have a good many &#x201C;Articles&#x201D; still lying in me; and indeed I have been thinking of late seriously, whether I should not set up some little bit <hi rend="italic">Paper</hi> of my own, and publish them there.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote to his wife, <date when="1848-06-08">8 June</date>: &#x201C;Carlyle talks of editing a newspaper he has so much to say about the evil times&#x201D; (Rusk 4:81). Espinasse says that when the ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> could tolerate no more than two of TC&#x2019;s articles, &#x201C;Carlyle was now convinced that he could not find in British journalism as then constituted a pulpit from which to preach to the governing classes. He began to talk of starting an organ of his own, which &#x2026; he spoke of as &#x2018;Twopenny Trash&#x2019;&#x201D; (173). Thomas Erskine wrote to TC, <date when="1848-06-01">1 June</date>: &#x201C;I have read your articles, with the wish that you had some steady organ, through which you might converse with the people of these countries periodically.&#x201D;</note> But that is a little precarious, would certainly be very <hi rend="italic">fashious</hi> [troublesome], and I do not like it much. On the other hand, there is no Newspaper that can stand my Articles; no <hi rend="italic">single</hi> Newspaper that they would not blow the bottom out of in a short while! For example, the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> should have had all these three last Articles put together as one: but then poor little Lord John Russell is a pet of theirs, and I could not put them on doing such a thing; so had to cut the <pb id="pg-23-34" n="23:34"/>Article in <hi rend="italic">three</hi>, and publish two pieces of it in a declared enemy of his. This is too troublesome.&#x2014; At worst, if nothing else will do, I can write the things in a <hi rend="italic">Book;</hi> and really that is perhaps the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> way, in other respects too, after all. We are going to have sore times in this country, I perceive; and the trade of a &#x201C;Governor&#x201D; will not long be possible as poor Lord John and the like of him are used to manage it. Our streets even here, what I never saw before, are getting encumbered with <hi rend="italic">Irish</hi> beggars; and in the manufacturing districts, as I hear from people on the spot, there hardly ever was greater misery. Something does imperatively require to be <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> and I want Lord John to know that,&#x2014;and go about <hi rend="italic">his</hi> business as soon as he can!</p>
 <p>Jack is well here, and very busy; doing really a good work in a faithful manner; which will really be, and is already, a strength and comfort to him. He was here last night; we mostly see him somewhere every day.&#x2014; Mrs Paulet, Miss Jewsbury, Mr Paulet, and a great rabble more have just returned upon us from Paris, where they have been for a fortnight, &#x201C;larking&#x201D; (as it is here called) that is, &#x201C;out upon the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ploy</hi></foreign> [out for a frolic].&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury, the Paulets, and W. E. Forster left for Paris, <date when="1848-05-01">1 May</date>, to see what they could of revolutionary activities there.

<salute>My Lord,</salute>
<p>I know not whether I do a prudent or even a not impertinent act in offering for your perusal the inclosed Letter, unexpectedly received by me from a man who, to his own sorrow and that of all the world, has become of some importance in your sphere at present.</p>
 <p>John Mitchell of the <hi rend="italic">United Irishman</hi> called on me once at Chelsea, in the time of Smith O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s foolish &#x201C;coalhole&#x201D; business;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Mitchel (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875">75</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18828"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460119-TC-CGD-01"><sic>20:105</sic><corr>TC to GCD, <date when="1846-01-19">19 Jan. 1846</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460823-JWC-TC-01"><sic>21:25&#x2013;26</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1846-08-23">23 Aug. 1846</date></corr></ref>), Irish nationalist and journalist; see K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Ireland, John Mitchel, and his &#x2018;sarcastic friend&#x2019; Thomas Carlyle,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Literatur im Kontext&#x2014;Literature in Context, Festschrift f&#xfc;r Horst W. Drescher</hi>, ed. J. Schwend et al. (Frankfurt, <date when="1992">1992</date>) 131&#x2013;42. Mitchel and Gavan Duffy had been friends working together on the <hi rend="italic">Nation.</hi> But as Mitchel grew increasingly militant in his advocacy of Irish national independence and the use of force, he broke with Duffy and set up <hi rend="italic">The United Irishman</hi>, a Dublin weekly, <date when="1848-02-12">12 Feb.</date> to <date when="1848-05-27">27 May</date>. In it he attacked Lord Clarendon and incited rebellion. On <date when="1848-03-20">20 March</date> he was charged with sedition but not prosecuted because of the govt.&#x2019;s fear that it could not secure a jury conviction. Mitchel was charged under the new treason felony act, <date when="1848-05-13">13 May</date>; tried, <date when="1848-05-25">25</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-05-26">26 May</date>; sentenced, <date when="1848-05-27">27 May</date>, to transportation for fourteen years; and dispatched to Spike Island (1 mi. S of Queenstown in Cork harbor) before being taken overseas. William Smith O&#x2019;Brien (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864">64</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20471"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish nationalist, leader of Young Ireland, and M.P. for Limerick, <date when="1835">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">49</date>, had been taken into custody by the sergeant-at-arms, <date when="1846-04">April</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-05">May 1846</date>, for refusing to serve on a parliamentary railway committee. Mitchel met TC, <date when="1846-05-14">14 May 1846</date>, on a delegation to visit Smith O&#x2019;Brien.</note> and, the autumn before last, I spent two days a good deal in his company at Dublin; from which opportunities of direct survey and communication, tho&#x2019; except by public rumour he has been a stranger to me since, I gathered the lasting conviction,&#x2014;and perhaps have mentioned it even to yourself (once at Alverstoke, on a snowy walk,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably in <date when="1847-02">Feb. 1847</date>; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470204-TC-JAC-01"><sic>21:153</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1847-02-04">4 Feb. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> in other circumstances than these),&#x2014;that Mitchell, enveloped in such frightful aberrations, is nevertheless intrinsically a gifted, brave, and even noble minded young man; whom indeed it has now grown absolutely indispensable to silence; but who, had it not been for a certain windy &#x201C;Liberator&#x201D; and loud False-Prophet the baleful misleader of many,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel O&#x2019;Connell.</note> might have done his Country real service, and been a help, not a hindrance, to a noble minded Governor of Ireland. This <pb id="pg-23-36" n="23:36"/>unexpected Letter, indicating to the same effect, and almost the only Letter I have ever had from poor Mitchell, has agitated various emotions in me; and I decide on offering it, as an additional and not quite worthless Document in the intricate Suit now pending. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland stands a long way removed from the United Irishman divided from him by a most confused <hi rend="italic">un</hi>transparent and bewildering medium. That the Lord Lieutenant should get to see him, on any side, for what he actually is,&#x2014;this cannot tend to harm, but must tend to benefit only.</p>
<p>Nobody has seen the Letter but your friends Lord and Lady Ashburton, and accidentally Richard Milnes; all of whom are touched with sympathy for the misguided Mitchell. In the event of his being found guilty by a Jury, it is a natural desire that such a man, whatever doom is appointed him, may not be confounded with common Felons; and indeed I think there will arise a feeling that it might beseem the Lord Lieutenant&#x2019;s magnanimity to subdue this man by nobleness and clemency rather than by force and rigour, should such a course seem possible;&#x2014;to which effect, in the desired event of a condemnation, perhaps some Petition of a more formal character may arise among us here.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Whatever effect TC&#x2019;s letter had, Clarendon told Lord Grey, <date when="1848-05-29">29 May</date>, that he had arranged (even before the trial) for &#x201C;decent accommodation&#x201D; for Mitchel on Spike Island and given orders &#x201C;not to be too rigorous about cropping or clothing&#x201D; (MS: Clarendon Papers).</note></p>
<p>For the present if, by way of answer, your Lordship will, without word spoken or written,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Clarendon replied to TC, <date when="1848-05-30">30 May</date>: &#x201C;I thank you for sending me Mitchells letter w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is to me a document of peculiar interest &#x26; importance for it proves what I have too often heard asserted but never before had sufficient ground for believing, viz that Mitchell is not quite sane or that his brain is occasionally excited by opium or other potent stimulants. No one can read these two powerfully written sheets of dreamy aberrations without feeling that Mitchell is a fanatic, but he is fanatic all the more dangerous for being as you truly say a gifted, brave &#x26; even a nobleminded man. My enquiries led me to believe that such was his character &#x26; I felt respect for him. I even admired the outspoken courage &#x2026; altho I was the principal mark for his invective, &#x26; tho&#x2019; he called upon me to prosecute him &#x2026; [and] altho I was censured on all sides for not putting the law in force, I determined not to interfere with Mitchell until I became convinced that he was really doing harm.&#x201D; But when Mitchell was widely listened to and aimed not only &#x201C;to establish a republic in Ireland of wh. he was to be the head, but also a regular Jacquerie, &#x26; <hi rend="italic">to kill</hi> every possessor of property in order to secure that <foreign><hi rend="italic">tabula rasa</hi></foreign> &#x2026;, why then I felt that there was no longer an option, &#x2026; that the Gov<hi rend="italic">t sh</hi>d put him down or he the Gov<hi rend="italic">t.</hi> must be tried. / Even now it is inexpressibly painful to me to have had even indirectly a part in banishing Mitchell &#x2026; &#x26; if he had furnished the slightest pretext for the exercise of mercy I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been the first to press it upon the favorable consideration of the Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi>., but that was not in his character to do, &#x26; you will have seen that even after sentence was passed upon him he reaffirmed all the principles &#x26; opinions for w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he had been convicted&#x2014;he must be a hero or a martyr, &#x26; if he cannot make himself President of the Irish Republic he will not move a finger to save himself from transportation.&#x201D;</note> please to stamp a bit of hot wax on that Letter and let <pb id="pg-23-37" n="23:37"/>the Post-Office do the rest, I shall take it as a kind forgiveness of this intrusion, and as all the answer that is either fit or desirable in the actual circumstances.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC also wrote to Mitchel about the same time, noting in his Journal, <date when="1848-07-12">12 July</date>: &#x201C;Irish Mitchel, (poor fellow) he is now in Bermuda, as a felon. Letter from him, letter to him, to and from Ld Clarendon: was really sorry for poor Mitchel; but what help?&#x201D; Years later, <date when="1866-09-12">12 Sept. 1866</date>, Mitchel was to write from Paris: &#x201C;It is time for me to acknowledge receipt or your letter dated <date when="1848-05">May 1848</date>&#x2014;Not that it calls for an answer, seeing that it is itself an answer to a letter from me. That letter was handed to me just as they were carrying me into Court to receive (what they called) sentence, &#x26; to be thence carried off beyond sea. Could not read it then&#x2014;saw it was from you, and sent it to my wife to be kept for me&#x2014;knowing that if it were found with me it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be taken away by my enemy. So it was three years old when I got it to read&#x201D; (MS: NLS 1768.171). Thomas Erskine wrote to TC, <date when="1848-06-01">1 June</date>: &#x201C;What do you think of this curious heroico-pathetic scene at the conviction of John Mitchel for madness I should say, still more than for felony.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>Dear Eckermann,</salute>
<p>Having a sure opportunity today, I write you a small word which I have long been anxious to send, had I known distinctly whither to address it. My understanding still is that Weimar is your headquarters; but a notion, gathered probably from Mr Marshall,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Marshall, sec. to the grand duke of Weimar.</note> possesses me that you are sometimes absent for considerable periods from Weimar: so on the whole, this little Note, concerning the <hi rend="italic">Faust Ms.</hi> entrusted to me last year,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470629-TC-CKJB-01"><sic>21:244</sic><corr>TC to CKJB, <date when="1847-06-29">29 June 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> is not written <hi rend="italic">till now.</hi></p>
<p>Mr Marshall, I doubt not, informed you of my endeavours in regard to that; and how, at last, as the likeliest thing feasible, I had put it into the hands of the Ritter <hi rend="italic">Bunsen</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In England he was usually known as Chevalier Bunsen. <hi rend="italic">Ritter</hi> means &#x201C;knight.&#x201D;</note> the Prussian Ambassador here, who cheerfully undertook to offer it to the King of Prussia, and advise his acceptance of it and his making you a present equal to &#xa3;50 in return. You yourself, I remember, stated some <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bedenklichkeiten</hi></foreign> [doubtfulness] as to Humboldt <pb id="pg-23-38" n="23:38"/>at the Prussian Court;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >F. H. Alexander von Humboldt (<date when="1769">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">1859</date>), Prussian naturalist and diplomat. Amalie B&#xF6;lte wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1847-12-14">14 Dec. 1847</date>, that she had recently told TC about the letters of Humboldt&#x2019;s brother Wilhelm (<date when="1767">1767</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835">1835</date>), <hi rend="italic">Briefe an eine Freundin</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1847">1847</date>), which Varnhagen would send him. She indicated to TC &#x201C;that Humboldt put duty as the first purpose in life, and I asked him if he didn&#x2019;t think Humboldt&#x2019;s attitude was too harsh. He gave me a long angry glare &#x2026; and burst out: &#x2018;You ask me that question which has been the curse of my life which haunts me by day and by night. If you will not drive me mad, do not repeat it&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 49, trans.). She appears to test TC&#x2019;s views against those of Varnhagen, who also found the work &#x201C;too monkish, too ascetic&#x201D; (Varnhagen, <hi rend="italic">Briefe an eine Freundin</hi> 54).</note> which also were duly submitted by me to Bunsen: but, in spite of these (which seemed to him very easy to guard against), he decided to persevere; and did persevere, and do as he had promised, it would appear, before or shortly after Mr Marshall&#x2019;s departure from England. This was the fact I should have communicated to you long ago,&#x2014;but have, in my idle uncertainties, neglected till now. It is still all the fact I have on the subject. Some four or five months ago I inquired of B<hi rend="italic">n</hi> whether he had heard any news of the matter? To which he answered, None whatever. The <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi>, and the advice what to do with it, had been sent to his Prussian Majesty, and as no answer in contradiction had come, he, Ritter Bunsen, had no doubt, the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> was now lying in the Royal Library at Berlin, and the expected return in your hands at Weimar.&#x2014; So stands it on my side: since that I have heard nothing.</p>
<p>Pray have the kindness to write me directly whether Bunsen&#x2019;s theory of the business is the correct fact! I hope it is; but if <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, it ought not to rest there.</p>
<p>I long for your Third Volume of <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che</hi> which already sends a good rumour of itself into these far regions.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The third vol. of Eckermann&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che mit Goethe &#x2026; <date when="1823">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832">32</date></hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1848">1848</date>); see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360912-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:61</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-09-12">12 Sept. 1836</date></corr></ref>. TC&#x2019;s letter was possibly prompted by one from W. Weissenborn, who wrote, <date when="1848-05-23">23 May</date>, from Weimar, asking permission to send him &#x201C;a relic of Schiller&#x2019;s,&#x201D; a model of the table on which he wrote, covered with part of the original oilcloth. If TC agreed, he would send it &#x201C;with the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Vol. of the Conversations of G&#xF6;the, which has just been published and which D<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> Eckermann is anxious to let you have as soon as possible.&#x201D;</note> Will you give our kind regards, our sincere hopes and wishes, to Mr Marshall; who has left a very lively remembrance of himself in this house.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
 <p>After some delay, I have had that matter of the Dudley-Wyatt Letter and Mr Hartshorne looked into at the Museum, by a sure hand; and, last night, got final report upon it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edleston wrote, <date when="1848-05-11">11 May</date>, sending further information about Cromwell&#x2019;s letter on behalf of Dudley Wyatt. Charles Henry Hartshorne (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865">65</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12504"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), antiquary, pbd. <hi rend="italic">The Book of Rarities in the University of Cambridge: illustrated by original letters and notes, biographical, literary, and antiquarian</hi> (<date when="1829">1829</date>), in which he printed the letter about Dudley Wyatt from the copy in the Harleian MSS in the British Museum. The &#x201C;sure hand&#x201D; was probably John Bruce or possibly Thomas Watts.</note></p>
<p>The reference to &#x201C;Harl.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read, with much attention, the Four Letters of Oliver Cromwell, lately published by you in the <hi rend="italic">Norwich A<supplied>[r]</supplied>chaeological</hi> &#x26;c;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480318-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1848-03-18">18 March</date></ref>. Letter omitted.</note> and must beg, for my own special objects, to have the liberty of addressing one question to you: Whether, in a word, the Letters are <hi rend="italic">autograph</hi> or not?</p>
<p><pb id="pg-23-40" n="23:40"/>I suppose them to be all autograph; but you do not anywhere expressly say so, that I can find; and, at p. 43, you casually speak as if the Authenticity of the Letters were or could be <hi rend="italic">confirmed</hi> by internal evidence,&#x2014;as if the external evidence were not of itself quite <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> question. Oliver&#x2019;s handwriting, I need not tell you, is well known for its peculiarities still visible in many specimens, and could be sworn to in any Court of Justice. Pray have the kindness to satisfy me in one word as to this: in another edition of the Cromwell Book (when we come to that), I of course mean to introduce these Letters, and ought to say whether they are autograph or not, as now in your hands.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They were autograph letters, printed and so indicated in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:153&#x2013;56, 166&#x2013;67, 171&#x2013;74; 9:221&#x2013;24.</note></p>
<p>If autograph, as I suppose, the Letter pp. 51&#x2013;55 is especially curious; for it has been printed, in the Old Newspapers, and in Rushworth (V.278), these two centuries:&#x2014;printed, as you may see too, in that Book of mine (I.182), all <hi rend="italic">except</hi> the first paragraph (p. 51 of yours) and a bit of the last (pp. 53&#x2013;4), which have been omitted for very obvious reasons.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:153&#x2013;56, where TC also notes the omissions in newspaper sources and in John Rushworth, <hi rend="italic">Historical Collections</hi>, 7 vols. (<date when="1659">1659</date>&#x2013;<date when="1701">1701</date>) (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:60). This was the only one of Turner&#x2019;s letters that TC had previously printed.</note> I suppose therefore it may be the oldest Newspaper Letter now in existence!&#x2014; Tho&#x2019; of course it was not from <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, but from a copy furnished, and slightly doctored, by the official persons, that the Newspapers got their material.&#x2014; &#x2014; &#x201C;Captain Margerie&#x201D; I find named again, still Captain of Horse, in <date when="1651">1651</date>, &#x201C;troop of 120 men&#x201D;; but know nothing more whatever of him.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:166&#x2013;67. TC was never able to identify Ralph Margery, capt. in Cromwell&#x2019;s own regt. in <date when="1644">1644</date> and in Sir Robert Pye&#x2019;s in the New Model: &#x201C;Of Captain Margery, elsewhere than in that Suffolk Troop now mustering, I know nothing&#x201D; (6:166).</note></p>

<p>The bearer of this is Mr. Espinasse, a friend of mine, and known also to Mr. Forster,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster, ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> since <date when="1847-11-01">1 Nov. 1847</date>.</note>&#x2014;who, I am very sure, had he been with you, would have warmly seconded the errand that now brings Mr. Espinasse.</p>
<p>He comes, namely, with a paragraph about Mr. Emerson&#x2019;s Lectures, for <pb id="pg-23-41" n="23:41"/>next <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi> and I much wish you would put him in communication with the proper party for that object.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No mention of Emerson&#x2019;s lectures appears in the next <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-06-10">10 June</date>; but on <date when="1848-06-17">17 June</date> a letter appeared, dated Hampstead, <date when="1848-06-14">14 June</date>: &#x201C;Sir,&#x2014;The lectures of Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson leave only one thing to be regretted, viz., that they cannot be heard by the whole literary and artistic public of the metropolis. The guinea for the course renders this impossible. How many there are who love beauty, and know well what it is, and create it afresh every day, for their fellow men; and yet they cannot reap guineas for their own instruction. I would therefore suggest to Mr Emerson, through your influential trumpet (what I <hi rend="italic">dare not</hi> suggest as a private friend), that he present the literary men of London with his utterances on a liberal scale. It might be done by fixing some small admission charge. &#x2026; I feel that it ought to be done, because Emerson is a phenomenon whose like is not in the world, and to miss him is to lose an important, informing fact, out of the nineteenth century. &#x2026; <name>[signed] AN ATTENDANT ON EMERSON&#x2019;S PRESENT COURSE.</name>&#x201D;</note> In Mr. Forster&#x2019;s absence, I think I can safely recommend this, as right for every one; and certainly I do myself much desire it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Espinasse reports that TC&#x2019;s attitudes toward Emerson&#x2019;s lectures was at best ambivalent. &#x201C;Very soon after the delivery of the first lecture I accompanied Carlyle to Emerson&#x2019;s domicile, a visit apparently intended to be one of congratulation on his lecturing success. Emerson was at home, and Carlyle seemed to find the process of congratulation rather embarrassing. He could get out little more than that the lecture was &#x2018;very Emersonian,&#x2019; which, considering that Emerson had been the lecturer, was not striking or enthusiastic praise. Then the subject was swiftly dismissed and succeeded by a conversation on a common friend. &#x2026; Elsewhere than in Emerson&#x2019;s presence, &#x2018;Moonshine&#x2019; pithily expressed Carlyle&#x2019;s opinion on his London lectures. But, before Emerson left England for home a few weeks afterwards, Carlyle spoke more kindly of his friend&#x2019;s lectures as &#x2018;intellectual sonatas,&#x2019; and of the friend himself as &#x2018;a beautiful figure among those talking Yankees,&#x2019; and the ideal of an American gentleman&#x201D; (163&#x2013;64).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Miss&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute>
<p>You have sent me a beautiful Book-marker, and a beautiful expression of your youthful regard; both of which I accept with thanks.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In an unpbd. essay, &#x201C;Some Old Letters,&#x201D; Julia Hodgson wrote that in <date when="1848">1848</date> she sent a letter to TC because she had been &#x201C;devouring everything of Carlyle&#x2019;s that I could obtain, and at last I could no longer refrain from letting him know my gratitude for the new world of thought, which he had opened out to me.&#x201D; She had made a bookmarker with the motto <foreign>&#x201C;Ernst ist das Leben&#x201C;</foreign> (from the prol. to Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi>, a favorite quotation of TC&#x2019;s and the motto to <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>) and sent it to TC, &#x201C;pleading that as he had taught me Hero-worship, he would excuse my enthusiasm.&#x201D; When she received TC&#x2019;s response, she wrote, &#x201C;Words can hardly describe my delight&#x201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:9).</note> Yours is the <pb id="pg-23-42" n="23:42"/>season of admiration, and generous young gratitude,&#x2014;wise and lasting, or transient and unwise. Much of it will die away in you as you grow older; but much also, I hope, will continue. For the quantity of wise admiration that remains with us, measures accurately our wealth in this world.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>After some delay, your obliging Note,&#x2014;with an apology from some Namesake of mine in the Hyde-Park region,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >T. Carlisle, 6 Hyde Pk. Pl., W Oxford St.</note>&#x2014;arrives at what I believe to be its true destination. Thanks for your continued goodwill to me, for your kind wishes and proposals.</p>
<p>Certainly I should like well to see Albury, which must be a doubly pleasant place in this bright leafy season: but, alas, there is no such thinskinned miserable traveller as I am; shattered to pieces by any tumult, or length of locomotion; unable to sleep in foreign beds &#x26;c &#x26;c; and the thought strikes me that it is chiefly, after all, the living Master of Albury that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do me good to see, and to exchange thoughts with, in these sad bodeful times! Which latter benefit, I always think, (even tho&#x2019; I can eat no dinners) might be attainable some time in London itself. Add to all which that I am quite unusually out of sorts at present, and engaged in moreover three times a week to attend Emerson&#x2019;s Lectures,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Espinasse says: &#x201C;When I spoke of the high ethical ideal which Emerson held up to us, Carlyle replied that Emerson&#x2019;s ethics consisted chiefly of &#x2018;prohibitions.&#x2019;&#x201D; Further, TC said: &#x201C;Mrs. Carlyle was more dissatisfied than her husband with Emerson&#x2019;s ethics. Dilating in his high-flown optimistic way on the ultimate triumph of good over evil, the lecturer went the length of saying that even when in a certain haunt of sensual vice, unmentionable to ears polite (though Emerson called it by its plain English name [a brothel]), man is still tending upwards, or words to that effect. Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s moral indignation at this statement knew no bounds, and for some time she could scarcely speak of Emerson with patience. I now and then fancied that after Emerson had been banqueted and welcomed by so many great and distinguished people in London, she viewed him, with a certain wife-like jealousy, as a sort of rival of her husband. Emerson&#x2019;s admiration for her abated visibly, till at last he was heard to say that the society of &#x2018;the lady&#x2019; &#x2026; was worth cultivating, mainly because she was the person who could tell you most about the husband&#x201D; (Espinasse 162&#x2013;63). Emerson, on the other hand, believed, as he wrote to his wife, <date when="1848-06-16">16 June</date>, that &#x201C;Carlyle takes a lively interest in our lectures &#x2026; &#x26; he is a very observed auditor tis very plain.&#x201D; Many famous people come and &#x201C;a great many more curiosities, but none better than Jane Carlyle &#x26; Mrs Bancroft who honestly come&#x201D; (Rusk 4:84).</note>&#x2014;to one of which (there will remain just one after your return) you also ought to go.</p>

<p>Many thanks for what you have done; and if on future journeyings you come on any other surviving traces of O. C.&#x2019;s habitation and warfare in this world, and will please to take an authentic portrait of them or of any of them, be sure you are deserving well, not of me but of all persons, and are turning your art to the most indubitable account. &#x2026;</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Robertson,</salute>
 <p>Thanks for the Packet you have sent me, which is very welcome in more ways than one;&#x2014;acceptable not only as a mark of your remembrance, but also as the first notice I get of a salutary, just, and most important decision of a social question in which all good Scotchmen take interest. I go wholly with you,&#x2014;so far as I have legs to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> on such a matter,&#x2014;in your reading of those old Acts, and application of them to present wants; and I cannot but sincerely wish and hope your judgement may be affirmed decisively by the Inner House,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first and second divisions of the court of session in Edinburgh, which mainly heard appeals from the outer house (where Lord Robertson sat) or from sheriff courts.</note> and become valid among us, and recognised universally as the Law of the Land.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently referring to a judgment by Lord Robertson, pbd. <date when="1848-06-10">10 June</date>, on the case of an able-bodied man refused relief for his children by the parish. Robertson upheld the sheriff&#x2019;s decision that the children could not work or find subsistence and were therefore entitled to relief. He had probably sent TC his pbd. notes on the case, which insisted that &#x201C;the law of no Christian country can enact such a barbarous system of tardy and perhaps useless relief, as that the party must become sick from actual want before is offered that which, timeously administered, would save him from sickness altogether.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1848-06-14">14 June</date>, pbd. this judgment with an appeal to the inner house on a similar case.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Before your American mail leaves today I will write you a few words, lest none other of them happen to write. I am very busy, and rather out of sorts for writing; but you will take my poor contribution as the best I have. Some weeks ago, after a good deal of delay, there arrived a short Letter, which you had written hastily at Brantford; very welcome to us, as indicating at least that you were all well; and only a few days after there came another (addressed to our Mother, I think), <hi rend="italic">considerably</hi> later in date:&#x2014;it would seem there is some small place in Canada itself called &#x201C;London,&#x201D; and in two instances now your Letters hither have gone to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> poor London,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Ontario, ca. 45 mi. ESE of Brantford.</note> and taken the air there a week or two before they came on! Pray put &#x201C;England,&#x201D; therefore, or &#x201C;By Steamer,&#x201D; upon your Letter;&#x2014;and for the rest, especially in summer-time, the mails are so frequent now (one every fortnight, or even every week), you had better just write when you feel at leisure, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> time, and put the sheet into the Post-Office to take its chance, if you have not by accident some clearer guidance. Jack also suggests that you should, <hi rend="italic">once</hi> at least in every <hi rend="italic">month</hi>, send our Mother a <hi rend="italic">Newspaper:</hi> the address, in your hand, with <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> (if kind Providence enable you to <hi rend="italic">that</hi>) will signify the essential to her, and the thing costs only a penny here, and I suppose very little on your side either. Attend to this, if you can.&#x2014; I will endeavour to ascertain better, some day, when the mails do leave your shores: but in the meanwhile, follow the above (<foreign>viz.</foreign> to write when you like), and we shall not be far wrong.</p>
<p>We had a Letter today from Scotsbrig, of Isabella&#x2019;s writing: she reports very comfortably indeed of our good Mother, who went home from a long visit to Dumfries and Jenny, about a month ago; and is at present very tolerably well, according to Isabella,&#x2014;&#x201C;much better since she got into the country air again.&#x201D; Doubtless the beautiful summer is a help to her; for <pb id="pg-23-52" n="23:52"/>there was hardly ever finer weather,&#x2014;warm winds and a fair proportion of soft rain;&#x2014;the crops, they say, look beautiful, and are far ahead of the average for this season of the year in Annandale especially. This is all our news from that quarter. They do not write often; I write to my Mother without much reply. Jean has a new <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairn</hi></foreign> lately (a girl, I think), which of course rather ties her hands in the writing way.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Aitken (<date when="1848">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895">95</date>), who m., <date when="1879">1879</date>, TC&#x2019;s nephew and future ed. Alexander Carlyle (<date when="1843">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1931">1931</date>), Alexander&#x2019;s son.</note> Mary of the Gill has also a young child some months ago,&#x2014;a boy, this time,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Austin.</note>&#x2014;as perhaps you have already heard. They are all well, or in their usual way, for anything we know or guess.</p>
<p>Not long since I had a Letter from Brother John, on his arriving at &#x201C;Fredericksburgh near Simco,&#x201D; which is a piece farther away from you than before.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their half-brother John Carlyle (<date when="1792">1792</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1872">1872</date>; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180902-TC-JCE-01"><sic>1:139</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1818-09-02">2 Sept. 1818</date></corr></ref>). Simcoe is a town in SE Ontario, 20 mi. SE of Brantford and ca. 8 mi. from Lake Erie.</note> He wished to give me his new address for the Newspaper, which accordingly I have observed since then; he also lamented about some kind of argument or quarrel you and he had had, and how you said to him some thing about &#x201C;selling his birth right for a mess of pottage,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 25:31&#x2013;34.</note>&#x2014;which I wrote back to him was all nonsense; and a thing you probably meant very little by, and would have forgotten before you next met him. Poor fellow, do not be too severe on him!&#x2014; Jack and I could not help laughing at the &#x201C;mess of pottage,&#x201D; when we figured to ourselves here how the thing had probably been. I have <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> the Newspaper, and hope the poor fellow gets it duly&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are in our usual poorish way of health here, which does not grow very brilliant in spite of the good weather: however, we still stir about in a grumbling way, and even Jane is pretty well on foot at present. Jack sticks obstinately to his task, and it proves very <foreign><hi rend="italic">dreigh</hi></foreign> [slow] to get done: but I believe it will be really <hi rend="italic">well</hi> done at last, and prove a useful thing.&#x2014; I myself am beginning to write again,&#x2014;for the wild revolutionary times urge me on;&#x2014;but I do not get much under way yet; and indeed am much at a loss what form to <hi rend="italic">throw</hi> the thing into: but I must <hi rend="italic">bore</hi> along, &#x201C;<foreign>stogging and blonking</foreign> [walking heavily and awkwardly]&#x201D; (as you once defined Corson&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The tenant at Craigenputtoch; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400910-TC-AC-01"><sic>12:247</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1840-09-10">10 Sept. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> ploughing); and nothing <hi rend="italic">but</hi> persistence will find me out the right method. I once thought of writing a long set of <hi rend="italic">articles</hi> for Newspapers, of which two samples I think were sent to you of late; but the thing does not well take that shape; and in fact I know not <hi rend="italic">what</hi> to do with it, but shall gradually know.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-23-53" n="23:53"/>I suppose you hear enough about our Chartists; and how the French, and indeed all Nations, are puddling deep in the quagmire of revolution and social distress: the Chartists do us next to no mischief here as yet (to us here at <hi rend="italic">Chelsea</hi>, none at all); but the look of that concern is very ominous too, and I believe there are great miseries and confusions at no great distance for Britain generally, and bad days are coming, and must come before many years go! We cannot help it; I cannot:&#x2014;nor do I see any hope of real remedy till long <hi rend="italic">after</hi> our poor fight will have altogether ended, and that of our sons and grandsons perhaps too!&#x2014; Much terrible distress prevails just now in the manufacturing regions; and the Irish people have got again into a large potatoe-crop this year, with which, if it fail, they will be in a bad way!&#x2014; On the whole, I cannot but think you lucky, dear Brother, in spite of all your trials and sorrows, that you have got your family into a hopefuller land than this, and have a piece of soil of your own to till, and little else but Heaven to be responsible to. God keep you in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> ways always, and so <hi rend="italic">all</hi> will be well!&#x2014;</p>
<p>A Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Sterling here (<hi rend="italic">John&#x2019;s</hi> brother, the writer&#x2019;s whom you know of) gave us a large map of Upper Canada, which he made while soldiering there. Here is the reduced copy of a scrap of it round Brantford; I want you to put down the exact situation of <hi rend="italic">Bield</hi>, and send it back to me that we may know.&#x2014; If there ever come anybody that could take a &#x201C;Sketch&#x201D; of the House &#x26;c&#x2014; But that alas is not at all likely.</p>
<p><closer><salute>You will give our affectionate regards to Tom and Jane, and their Mother and all the rest. Let us hear soon that you continue busy and well; and describe to us as far as possible all you are occupied with. Farewell, dear Brother, for this time.</salute></closer></p>

 <p>Any friend of yours is welcome to me along with you, at any time.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laurence replied to TC&#x2019;s note of <date when="1848-06-14">14 June</date> on the same date, saying that he looked forward to calling on him soon and asking &#x201C;may my friend Mr Geldart come too.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You are very kind; and do not forget us, tho&#x2019; we see nothing of you. Certainly I will accept with thankfulness your Book on Spanish Art;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Annals of the Artists of Spain</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1848">1848</date>). Stirling&#x2019;s interest in Spain and Spanish art arose from his visits to Spain earlier in the decade. At the time Spanish art was a subject practically unexplored in Britain.</note> and <pb id="pg-23-56" n="23:56"/>endeavour to instruct myself a little in regard to those remote products of this opulent universe, and ascertain whether I have any heritage at all among them, under your guidance, which is understood to be the best. Many thanks to you beforehand.</p>
<p>Greenwich on Sunday would also be a most tempting proposal to any but a wretched Dyspeptic like myself,&#x2014;who, alas, am obliged to decline all dinners, and to picture Heaven as a place where eating will be no longer needed! Not to say that I have a kind of regular engagement here at home (rendezvous with my Brother &#x26;c on that day of the week); and am at present, moreover, in quite unusually unfit condition for an adventure like yours.</p>
 <p>This is the fact: and I the more regret it, as I also have a desire to know Mr Ford, whose Spanish Book I have decided to read some day (a great distinction in this particular house);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Ford (<date when="1796">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">1858</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9863"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), critic and author of books on Spain. His <hi rend="italic">Handbook for Travellers in Spain</hi> (<date when="1845">1845</date>; rev. edn., <date when="1847">1847</date>) was a popular, learned guide. According to the <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9863"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>, his obituary in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, attributed to Stirling, said of it that &#x201C;so great a literary achievement had never before been performed under so humble a title.&#x201D;</note> and whose face and appearance, one day when I saw him with you, seemed decidedly promising. Cannot I meet such a man <hi rend="italic">without</hi> an indigestion, then; wretch that I am? I will come any evening, and smoke a cigar with you and him, in Clarges Street<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the Clarges St. Hotel.</note> (he must be up to cigars); or if you will bring him down hither any ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> he shall have our best welcome. That seems the best method.</p>
<p>On the whole, why don&#x2019;t you come and see us oftener, you? We are not out one evening in twenty; but sit here quietly reading books,&#x2014;perhaps idly listening to a little music (<hi rend="italic">Coolun, Gilderoy</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Gilderoy&#x201D; is a ballad; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441014-TC-DL-01"><sic>18:238</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1844-10-14">14 Oct. 1844</date></corr></ref>. &#x201C;Coolun&#x201D; is an unidentified song.</note> or such like) from the piano, now and then;&#x2014;and in silence, as beseems the genus homo, &#x201C;looking before and after&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>We shall be happy to make acquaintance with Mrs Crowe, whenever she so pleases to honour us.

<p>I wish you had told me something about your own history past and prospective; which I never cease to take an interest in, tho&#x2019; it is somewhat dim and vague to me in these late times.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It seems to me again too long since I have written to you; but the fault has not altogether been mine: besides, the only way to mend it is to write <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, before any one get in to interrupt me; which accordingly I do, the first work of the day.</p>
<p>We are well in health, and glad to find from Isabella that at Scotsbrig too things go moderately well. This is all our news; but this, I think, is mainly what you want. We have had a good deal of rain lately, which doubtless was bad for the hay, but in other respects a favourable kind of weather,&#x2014;very favourable to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for one, who like nothing so much as frequent showers in the London Summer. On the whole hitherto I hardly recollect a more pleasant season, so far as climate and temperature go, since we came here: a very <hi rend="italic">grey</hi> summer indeed, cool to the skin, yet warm to the ground, for the wind has generally been at once genial and plentiful: and now, at last <pb id="pg-23-60" n="23:60"/>within these three or four days, the Sun seems fairly to have got the upper hand, and we have real <date when="1848-07">july</date> weather, as bright blue and beautiful as heart could wish. Owing to the late rains, moreover, everything is unusually green, and as yet the wind keeps up amid the bright sunshine;&#x2014;so that we do perfectly well in as far as weather concerns us. Jane still stirs about, pretty fresh for her; Jack is busy, drawing nigh the end of his task now;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His trans. of the <hi rend="italic">Inferno.</hi>.</note>&#x2014;I, alas, am but <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> mine again, under many interruptions; and feel dreadfully &#x201C;stiff to y<hi rend="italic">e</hi> raise, Sandy, man!&#x201D; Bundles of Papers are getting accumulated round me, but I think they will mostly need to be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> at last, to make room for better.&#x2014; Isabella tells us you are going to Moffat;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 17 mi. NNE of Dumfries.</note> which I much approve of: pray let her give us notice when you do go. It will suit very well indeed, if you can get good weather and a quiet lodging, both of which I hope are possible.</p>
<p>Doubtless you have been reading of these awful explosions in Paris, which interest everybody, and are indeed an alarming symptom of the misery of this poor time. To us the most interesting feature of all is this General Cavaignac who has had the command in that terrible business. He is the younger brother of the Cavaignac we loved much and were very intimate with here, while he lived: we often heard of him as a just and valiant and everyway excellent man, whom his brother much loved; and indeed I believe him to be really such;&#x2014;which kind of character was certainly never more wanted than in the place he is now in!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The constituent assembly, elected in <date when="1848-04">April</date> and meeting for the first time, <date when="1848-05-05">5 May</date>, had reorganized the govt., giving power to an executive commission that appointed to ministries men from the provisional govt., but excluded the socialists, whose attempted attack on the assembly, <date when="1848-05-15">15 May</date>, had failed. The national workshops, set up to deal with unemployment, had been overwhelmed by more than 115,000 unemployed workers. Attempts to cut down the size of the workshops by the assembly led to a serious revolt by workers, socialists, and revolutionaries, <date when="1848-06-22">22</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-06-26">26 June</date>, with savage street fighting. Many were killed, deported, or imprisoned. Responsible for the suppression as minister of war, Gen. Louis Eug&#xE8;ne Cavaignac (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857">57</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361125-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:91</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1836-11-25">25 Nov. 1836</date></corr></ref>) then became pres. of the council, responsible to the assembly, with a moderate republican ministry. He was to be overwhelmingly defeated in the presidential elections in <date when="1848-12">Dec.</date> by Louis Napoleon. He was the brother of the Carlyles&#x2019; dear friend E. L. Godefroy Cavaignac.</note> Perhaps no man in all the world could have had so cruel a duty laid upon him, as that of cannonading and suppressing these wretched people, who we may say his Father and Brother and all his kindred had devoted themselves to stirring up:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His father, Jean Baptiste Cavaignac (<date when="1762">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829">1829</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360714-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:8</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-07-14">14 July 1836</date></corr></ref>), a member of the revolutionary national convention, had voted for the death of Louis XVI; his brother had been imprisoned during the early part of Louis Philippe&#x2019;s regime and escaped to exile, <date when="1835">1835</date>. Gen. Cavaignac remained a committed republican to his death.</note> but he saw it to be a <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>, and he has bravely done it. I suppose he will get <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> killed in the business, one day; and indeed he appears privately <pb id="pg-23-61" n="23:61"/>to look for nothing else. His poor old Mother still lives; has now no child but him;&#x2014;has a strange history indeed to look back upon, from the days of Robespierre all the way!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julie Cavaignac, b. Corancez (<date when="1780">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">1849</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360714-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:8</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-07-14">14 July 1836</date></corr></ref>).</note>&#x2014; It is very curious to me to think how the chiefs of these people, as Armand Marrast, Clement Thomas (late commander of the National Guards),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cl&#xE9;ment Thomas (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871">71</date>), republican politician; escaped imprisonment and went into exile, <date when="1835">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837">37</date>; commander-in-chief of the national guard in Paris, May&#x2013;June, when replaced during the uprising; exiled again, <date when="1851">1851</date>; executed by national guardsmen, <date when="1871">1871</date>.</note> used to sit and smoke a pipe with me in this quiet nook some years ago. And now Louis-Philippe is out, and <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are in,&#x2014;not forever either! &#x201C;The wheel of Fortune,&#x201D; as old Aunt Babby&#x2019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> dream said, &#x201C;the wheel of Fortune, one spake up and the other spake down!&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Emerson has been lecturing at a considerable rate here; meeting with moderately fair encouragement from a certain class. We had to attend him,&#x2014;not a very severe duty either, for there is really something of excellent in him tho&#x2019; he is a little &#x201C;moon shiny&#x201C;:&#x2014;however the thing is now over; and he is fast getting ready to go home to America again; <hi rend="italic">sails</hi> from Liverpool, in fact, tomorrow (or rather <hi rend="italic">saturday</hi>, for this is but thursday!) week.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson sailed from Liverpool, <date when="1848-07-15">15 July</date>, and landed in Boston, <date when="1848-07-27">27 July</date>.</note> A voyage of ten or twelve days, if happy, will land him at his own house-door, after a long and interesting absence;&#x2014;and as for us, the likelihood is, we shall never see him again at all. His present visit has not done much for me, nor could I in any way, do much for him: but he has and keeps up from old a very friendly feeling for me, and the very separations that lie between us add themselves to this probably final parting to make it sad and affectionate! How much is every one of us left <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> in this world; nothing above him but the eternal skies, no help or counsel for him except in Heaven only!</p>
<p>Emerson has asked me to make a little journey with him to see a strange old Antiquity, old almost as the Hills, which bears the name <hi rend="italic">Stonehenge</hi>, near Salisbury in Wiltshire, about 100 miles Southwest of this. It is some 4 hours by railway; the ground, for the greater part, already known to me (for it is partly the road to Alverstoke, thro&#x2019; Hampshire). I have consented to go; and so off we move tomorrow forenoon. A friend lives in the way,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Helps lived at Vernon Hill, Bishop&#x2019;s Waltham, Hants, 11&#xBD; mi. SE of Winchester.</note> who will lodge us one night as we return, or <hi rend="italic">two</hi> if we like,&#x2014;perhaps over the Sabbath till Monday: On Monday evening, Emerson sets off towards the North, and we do not see him again.&#x2014; Today, as you may fancy, I am making my bits of preparations and arrangements; I have various places to go to; so shall be busy all day,&#x2014;and indeed ought already to be getting <pb id="pg-23-62" n="23:62"/>under way!&#x2014; &#x2014; Jack talked to Emerson of going with us; but I know not whether he will stand good;&#x2014;probably not: I must consult him before night come.</p>
<p>On the whole, dear Mother, I must be off. You shall hear from me again, a word about the journey, so soon as we return. Tell Jamie I do not forget that I owe him a Letter: I will pay it by and by.&#x2014; From Jean at Dumfries, I hear nothing this good while; but suppose she is busy nursing, poor thing. My affectionate blessings to one and all.&#x2014; Get ready for Moffat, then, and off!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>Emerson and I are going off to see Stonehenge tomorrow:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1848-07-03">3 July</date>, that he would call on Wed., <date when="1848-07-05">5 July</date>, to take &#x201C;advice for Friday.&#x201D;</note> I wished to ask you about Hazzlitt&#x2019;s (and Dickens&#x2019;s and your) <hi rend="italic">Inn;</hi> a weighty inquiry,&#x2014;which, however, I will answer by guess: &#x201C;Little Ambesbury?&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS. Dickens and Forster had been to Salisbury Plain in late <date when="1848-03">March</date> and had explored Winterslow Hut, an inn where William Hazlitt (<date when="1778">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830">1830</date>) had written many of his finest essays (see <hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 5:265n).</note></p>
<p>A more important part of my errand, was to speak with you about a certain <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> on <hi rend="italic">Shakspeare&#x2019;s Sonnets</hi>, by Masson (whom you once saw at Chelsea), which Chapman lately had in hand, and I guess consulted you about.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nothing apparently came of the MS at this time. Masson&#x2019;s da. said that &#x201C;in <date when="1846">1846</date>, David Masson began in Edinburgh his own lifelong study of Shakespeare by devoting some months to what he afterwards called &#x2018;fond juvenile study&#x2019; of the Sonnets, and writing a commentary. This commentary was read at the time by Carlyle, and is annotated by him&#x201D; (David Masson, <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare Personally</hi>, ed. Rosaline Masson [<date when="1914">1914</date>] 194n). Chapman is apparently Edward Chapman. Masson and Forster had met in <date when="1844">1844</date> (see D. Masson, <hi rend="italic">Memories of London in the &#x2019;Forties</hi> [<date when="1908">1908</date>] 69&#x2013;73). Masson wrote at length to TC, <date when="1848-07-19">19 July</date>, thanking him for &#x201C;the kind letter&#x201D; and &#x201C;the trouble you have taken with my manuscript. / Although, as is natural, I regret that any part of the work should have broken down under your inspection, yet I am glad that the part that <hi rend="italic">has</hi> broken down is that supplementary enquiry about W. H. For, although the validity of that enquiry must materially affect the chances of the manuscript with Publishers &#x2026; yet I confess I have attached less value to it than to the parts that seek to interpret the Sonnets from within. &#x2026; I found the belief general among the Shakespeare people &#x2026; that the W. H. was almost certainly the Earl of Pembroke. &#x2026; There was also much unlikelihood in the notion of an intimacy between a player and a young Earl. &#x2026; [But there are] a number of minute coincidences in favour of a hypothesis against which there is a strong <hi rend="italic">prim&#xe2; facie</hi> improbability. Perhaps I have insensibly overstated the case. / As it is, your verdict on this point of course shakes me in the belief into which I had lured myself. &#x2026; / Dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, you cannot know how I value certain words in your letter which told me that at heart you cared for me&#x2014;me so lately a stranger to you, and still deserving nothing at your hands.&#x201D; TC evidently objected to the idea that Pembroke might have been W. H.</note> Has the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> any worth; and if so, what? Masson is a man of real <pb id="pg-23-63" n="23:63"/>parts; but I fear this Shakspeare Enterprise is not a very promising one. However, the poor fellow is very anxious about it; would very fain see it printed, I find; and cannot rest till he have exhausted all possibilities. Would the Longmans have any chance to try it?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The publishers Longman, Brown, Green, &#x26; Longmans.</note>&#x2014; On the whole, is it really a book of merit? Does it <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> the Sonnet hypothesis, or leave it still hypothetical? If you can do anything for poor Masson and it, I shall be really glad. At all events, you can tell me what degree of worth and likelihood seems to be in it.</p>
<p>I am at home all this ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, but I fear there is no chance of communicating with you till, on or after Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> when we return.</p>

<p>I cannot at this moment say within a few minutes when our Train starts tomorrow,&#x2014;for I have left my own railway book, and cannot get a bill. But this I can say, and let this suffice:</p>
<p>We breakfast at Chelsea tomorrow at 9,&#x2014;tea and coffee shall be ready for you if you come; and no <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> if you do not. Our Train (I <hi rend="italic">think</hi>) is at 11;&#x2014;at all events you must be at Chelsea <hi rend="italic">not</hi> later than half past 10, and as much earlier as you like. That is all.</p>

Emerson did in fact answer Forster&#x2019;s invitation to dine on the coming Sun. or Wed. He wrote from Cambridge, <date when="1848-07-06">6 July</date>, to say that Taylor had whisked him away so early that morning that he had not had time to write before his departure.</note> We go off tomorrow at 11 o&#x2019;clock; do not return till Sunday night at soonest; and then, as to meeting,&#x2014;alas, E. has to quit London, for good, by some evening train Northwards on <hi rend="italic">Monday Ev</hi>g: so that I fear there is no possibility in that direction.</p>
<p>Thank you for &#x201C;the Hut&#x201D;; thanks too for Masson.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480706-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1848-07-06">6 July</date></ref>, 2 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>, to which Forster had evidently replied.</note> I wish very much to have some speech with you myself soon: Paper-masses are again accumulating round me; and <hi rend="italic">the Times</hi>, I fear, will not do at all.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Espinasse writes: &#x201C;The Times he took in only for a brief period after the French Revolution of <date when="1848">1848</date> broke out. He expected from it, he told me, cleverer writing than he found in it, speaking, moreover, of the style of its articles as Johnsonian &#x2026; , and pronouncing the sentences to be all &#x2018;properly balanced,&#x2019; as if that were something astonishing in a &#x2018;leading journal.&#x2019; His former conception of the journalist as one who guided the people forward from day to day had vanished by this time, and a harsh one was substituted for it. Referring to the clever gentlemen who enlighten the world through the daily press he asked me, &#x2018;What are these fellows doing? They only serve to cancel one another.&#x2019; &#x2026; In a general way, the little that Carlyle cared to know about public affairs, beyond what he chanced to read of them in his weekly newspaper [the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>], he gathered from conversation, while in such circles as that of the Ashburtons, he met, heard, and talked with men who were &#x2018;making history&#x2019;&#x201D; (224&#x2013;25).</note> In fact the <pb id="pg-23-65" n="23:65"/>Paper-masses themselves will not do (the more is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sorrow, to say it!) for anything but the fire, I apprehend!

<p><salute>My Dear,&#x2014;</salute>It cannot be supposed that I have much to tell thee since morning, and indeed the day has passed over without accident at all; but being relegated here to a most lonesome and rather dilapidated bedroom, with no perceptible desire still to sleep, I have borrowed from Emerson a sheet of Note-paper, and from the people of the Inn a pen and inkbottle; and will vent a portion of my sorrows upon poor Chelsea before I go to bed. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu</hi></foreign> [Alas], am I not right to stay at <hi rend="italic">home?</hi> The world holds in it no man to whom travelling is such a labour, under any and all conditions!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We got along happily enough to Bishopstoke today,&#x2014;except that it appeared, the little Forster-and-Dickens Publichouse did not lie on our road at all, but lay on the road of some <hi rend="italic">Coach</hi>, which, at some unknown hour, <hi rend="italic">would</hi> (had we known of it) have taken us off the S. Western railway, and landed us <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi> at Salisbury or at least at Stonehenge: however, the damage was not great, and at any rate there was then no help. We did get to Salisbury, all right however, about three o&#x2019;clock: all <hi rend="italic">right</hi> as far as a poor wretch could be right, who could not get his lips closed, but was obliged to <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> all the way; and had not slept the night before!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">At</hi> the Salisbury Station we leapt straightway into a kind of Gig (inferior to the Derbyshire ones),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which they had taken the previous summer.</note> and were rapidly driven to this ancient village, some 8 miles <pb id="pg-23-66" n="23:66"/>further; here we, after some confused consulting, discharged our Gig-apparatus; got some wretched dinner, of whale-blubber mutton and old peas; and then in the grey windy evening set forth to walk towards Stonehenge over the bare upland; found it, saw it:&#x2014;a wild mournful, altogether enigmatic and bewildering sight;&#x2014;dreadfully cold too (in my thin coat), and after about 2 hours came our ways home again to Amesbury, an enchanted-looking village, very appropriate to the neighbourhood. Stonehenge and the uplands far and wide were utterly solitary; a vast, green, wavy tract of sheep-pasture, all studded with (what they call &#x201C;barrows&#x201D;) the tombs of extinct nations, and that huge mass of dark, meaningless, gigantic dislocated stones; of which no creature will ever tell us the meaning, except that it is the extinct temple of an extinct people (seemingly sunk very deep in <hi rend="italic">error</hi>), and the prey now of Pedants and doleful creatures whose whole element seems one of emptiness and error! The grim windy evening, spent amid those grim remains, in a mood such as mine, will probably long continue memorable to me. And that hitherto seem all the conquest I am like to get from it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After seeing Stonehenge they spent the night of <date when="1848-07-07">7 July</date> at the George Inn, Amesbury, 1&#xBD; mi. W of Stonehenge and 8 mi. N of Salisbury. For Emerson&#x2019;s account, see &#x201C;Stonehenge&#x201D; in his <hi rend="italic">English Traits</hi> (Boston, <date when="1856">1856</date>) ch. 16, and <hi rend="italic">Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks</hi> 10:334&#x2013;36, 432&#x2013;42.</note></p>
 <p>Returning to Amesbury, which seemed already sunk into sleep (about 9 o&#x2019;clock) or almost into death, we got Tea, the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> in nature, without cream, nay without milk except about half-a spoonful&#x2014;no help! The place is one of those Coach villages that have been ruined by railways: once the great road from Exeter to London, 12 Coaches a-day, and half a dozen &#x201C;families&#x201D; (i.e. posting carriages), now left sad and silent, the big inn rotting, and not even milk to be had! We leave tomorrow morning early for Wilton (past Stonehenge again) <hi rend="italic">in a Dog cart</hi>, the only attainable vehicle; and after a day of Wilton House, and Salisbury and Clarendom, hope to meet poor Helps at Bishopstoke, and attain a little cream to our tea,&#x2014;attain at least the hope of soon <hi rend="italic">ending</hi> such an expedition!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal TC wrote: &#x201C;Morrow morning [<date when="1848-07-08">8 July</date>], Dogcart across the downs to Wilton: Down or &#x2018;Plain,&#x2019; an expanse of waving bare ground, resembling a Scotch moor, only that it is without brooks, and of much more fertile character. Scandalous to see it lying vacant in the heart of such an England as ours at present is. &#x2026; then country road to Wilton; &#x2026; then full inspection of Sydney Herbert&#x2019;s house [Wilton House], which is princely: Bust of Cato: A. D&#xfc;rer&#x2019;s Picture; fairy &#x2018;luncheon&#x2019; by Mrs. Wager the Housekeeper. Salisbury Cathedral and City. Old Sarum, the day before.&#x2014; A. Helps caught us at Bishopsgate on the railway: home with him till the morrow (sunday) which poured a deluge of rain. To Winchester in the afternoon nevertheless. Cathedral there; first, St. Cross there. Home to Chelsea about 10 p.m.&#x2014; Emerson called next day, and is now off, towards Liverpool, or Coventry &#x26;c; to sail for home on Saturday. <foreign>Valeat&#x2014;eheu</foreign> [Let him be gone&#x2014;alas]!&#x2014;&#x201D; See also Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:440&#x2013;41.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Dr Weissenborn is so extremely polite, and you are so urgent, what can I do but at once satisfy you about that tremendous matter!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480529-TC-JPE-01">TC to JPE, <date when="1848-05-29">29 May</date></ref>.</note> The small Schiller Box was left here by a City Carrier, some four evenings ago; and the money given out for it, as I learn, was <hi rend="italic">seven shillings</hi> net; of which sum, I suppose, some <hi rend="italic">six</hi> might be the portion due for sea-conveyance, the maximum that could have lain on your shoulders. Pray accept the money to that extent from Dr Weissenborn; and write to me that you have given it to the first poor <foreign><hi rend="italic">fahrende Schuler</hi></foreign> [traveling scholar], or other meritorious indigent Son of Adam that may present himself to you at Weimar; and therewith shall our account be handsomely settled.</p>
<p>I will farther commission you to thank Dr Weissenborn with all cordiality on my part, till I have time more explicitly to do it myself: say that his valuable Gift, an authentic memorial of literary piety, involving Schiller, him and me <hi rend="italic">is</hi> duly valued here, and shall be held in careful keeping, and excite many kind remembrances among us. The little model is admirably contrived, for explaining itself, for authenticating itself: nothing had gone wrong in it at all, except two of the little <hi rend="italic">feet</hi>, which a touch of <hi rend="italic">glue</hi> has already put wholly to rights again; and now, under a respectable glass bell, the little monument, defended from dust and profane fingers, is to stand safe, and be held long in honour, we may hope.</p>
<p>Eckermann&#x2019;s Parcel has not yet reached me; but will, I may expect, <pb id="pg-23-68" n="23:68"/>before long. I shall be very glad indeed to get sight of it. Let me also hope to learn authentically what has become of the Faust <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> we had here; of which I have heard nothing certain since you left us.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480529-TC-JPE-01">TC to JPE, <date when="1848-05-29">29 May</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Your Letter, if you will take a big sheet and write it full on any set of topics, especially Weimar topics, cannot but be welcome to me. It has been long promised: please to remind yourself of that, the first good hour that comes.</p>
<p>I have just returned from a visit to Stonehenge in the Wiltshire Downs, with a certain Transatlantic Friend, R. W. Emerson, who, after some months&#x2019; sojourn in these parts, is on the point of turning homewards again. A man of genius and worth in his American way; somewhat <hi rend="italic">moonshiny</hi> here and there in the Results he arrives at, but beautiful in speculation if you leave practice <hi rend="italic">out</hi>,&#x2014;in fact a kind of modern-antique &#x201C;American <hi rend="italic">Gymnosophist</hi>,&#x201D; for whom we are bound to be thankful. He and his affairs keep me very busy this day: so without more writing, except to offer my kind regards to Eckermann, and best thanks to Dr Weissenborn above, I subscribe myself, with true remembrances from both parties here,</p>
<closer><salute>Yours sincerely /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chopin cannot <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> English, nor understand it <hi rend="italic">spoken</hi>&#x2014;alas no!&#x2014;but can he understand it <hi rend="italic">written</hi> I wonder?

<p>I never liked any music so well&#x2014;because <hi rend="italic">it feels</hi> to me not so much a sample of the man&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">art</hi> offered &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">on approbation</hi>&#x201D; (the effect of most music for me) but a portion of his soul and life <hi rend="italic">given away</hi> by him&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">spent</hi> on those who have ears to hear and hearts to understand.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here from Weimar is a Letter of Eckermann&#x2019;s, which gives us, among other things, questionable account of the fate of that poor <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> Manuscript you were charitable enough to take charge of, for him and me! It appears the poor man, far from receiving any money as we expected, has not got the smallest notice of any kind concerning his unfortunate <foreign><hi rend="italic">Handschrift</hi></foreign> [autograph]; and does not know, except by the negative indication you once gave me many months ago, that it has been accepted, or even that it has arrived and been offered! What is to be done with him or it? <pb id="pg-23-73" n="23:73"/>There have a great many weighty changes taken place in Berlin since that poor Paper went thither;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A workers&#x2019; uprising in March forced the king of Prussia temporarily to withdraw his troops from Berlin, promise to call an elected assembly, accept a liberal cabinet, and promote the cause of German unity.</note> probably enough the official man to whom you sent it is no longer in office; and in this general dislocation of all interests and objects, so small an object may have got shoved aside one knows not whither. I need not beg you to attempt whatever is still possible towards attaining some solution of this business,&#x2014;towards either getting back the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi>, or having some acknowledgement of it transmitted to the Weimar donor. I wait for a word from you, and will then write to him.</p>
<p>Poor Eckermann wishes farther, it appears, that you would read his new Volume of <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che.</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The third vol. of Eckermann&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che mit Goethe</hi> (Magdeburg, <date when="1848">1848</date>). Espinasse says that a letter from Eckermann to TC accompanied the vol., &#x201C;in which the then recent French Revolution was treated by Eckermann as &#x2026; &#x2018;another proof of the weakness of man,&#x2019;&#x201D; and that TC laughed at Eckermann&#x2019;s &#x201C;calmly contemptuous way&#x201D; of speaking of such an important event (174). For TC&#x2019;s reactions to some other events related in the <hi rend="italic">Conversations</hi>, see Espinasse 174&#x2013;76.</note> In this latter respect I think you might promise to satisfy him: at least I will fairly put you on the way, and in two idle hours you may pleasantly accomplish the problem. After tomorrow, my Copy of the Book shall be much at your service; and I can promise you at least it is not <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> reading,&#x2014;no, nor even weighty (<foreign><hi rend="italic">wichtig</hi></foreign>), but very suitable for hot weather, so far as I have gone!</p>
<p>I hope you do not yet mean to leave town; not till I see you again, for one thing.</p>

<salute>Dear Sister Jean,</salute>
<p>It seems a very long while since we heard directly from you, or since I wrote to you, as it was probably my turn to do. Indeed I suppose you are held very busy with your young Stranger;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her newborn baby, Mary.</note> and writing is by no means so handy in your premises at present as it is mine! Many times has this reflexion risen upon me in late weeks, with an urgent impulse to take up the <pb id="pg-23-74" n="23:74"/>pen straightway: but always something or other has come in the way. Indeed it is strange, almost tragical, and to you I am sure altogether inconceivable, what everlasting confusions, impediments and inane distractions beset a poor man in this place; how little of his own <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, except as it were <hi rend="italic">sword in hand</hi>, he can get accomplished; and how one could often, almost with tears, address to the Human Species at large, in one&#x2019;s despair, &#x201C;For God&#x2019;s sake, do not torment me farther; have the kindness to pass on, and never mind <hi rend="italic">me</hi> more, but leave me utterly silent, squatted in my ditch here!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014; In fact, it is sad enough how little good one gets of one&#x2019;s fellow creatures here, and how much hindrance and mischief: but there is no help for it; there is no other place provided for one but what is <hi rend="italic">worse!</hi> So one has to snatch an hour now and another then out of the gulph, as it were by the hair of the head, and turn them to account if one can. Today I decide on send<supplied>[ing]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> you a little word <hi rend="italic">before</hi> anything else is attempted; I snatch an hour for you from the top of the morning, and will leave work (if work there be) to <hi rend="italic">follow.</hi></p>
<p>We are in our usual state of health here, all of us; cannot specifically complain;&#x2014;but poor Jane, it must be admitted, is very <hi rend="italic">feckless</hi>, can <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> almost nothing, sleeps as ill <supplied>[as ev]</supplied>er, and ha<supplied>[s but a]</supplied> poor share of spirits this long while. I too am out of spirits often enough,&#x2014;which however means only that <hi rend="italic">I am out of work;</hi> that I have not yet got fairly into my work; that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get into it, or do worse! This I know from of old to be the secret; and there will be no cure for me till I act on it. If it be necessary I must grow <hi rend="italic">still unhappier</hi>,&#x2014;for it is needful that the wretch find his work, and get it done: there is no other use in him that I ever could discover!&#x2014; Let us be quiet then; let us be patient, and use what little strength we have. And so enough of that for the present. The Town is getting emptier now, will be quite empty in <supplied>[a]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> week or two: things will then be much quieter.</p>
<p>Jack expected, I daresay, to have been in Annandale long before this; but here he still is,&#x2014;his work very near done, you would say, yet never quite done, and hanging on at a rate of inconceivable <foreign><hi rend="italic">drieghness</hi></foreign> [tedious slowness], the ultimate tail of it! I do not like yet to guess how many weeks it may still detain him. Poor fellow, he is grown really thin over it, and will be much better for a bout of country idleness: but in return, I believe it is a piece of work not without value, and done right faithfully and well; which certainly is something and to the Doctor himself (apart from this temporary <hi rend="italic">leanness</hi>) it has very evidently done much good already,&#x2014;it has <hi rend="italic">composed</hi> and quieted him, and given him a kind of internal comfort such as I <pb id="pg-23-75" n="23:75"/>have seen nothing do this long while. So welcome him when he comes among you, poor fellow; and let him do the best he can among you.</p>
<p>Jane and I have yet made up no scheme for autumn; various people ask us to go hither and go thither; I sometimes privately think, it will be wiser and briefer to sit honestly still where we are,&#x2014;at least for me to do so: one can hardly be so <hi rend="italic">private</hi> anywhere as even in London for the next two months, so well <hi rend="italic">left alone;</hi> and that is what I often think would suit me of all things best at present. But we shall see. Indeed it is a feeling with me that I have not the slightest right to a jaunt this year; not having done any work at all since I was last jaunting! We shall see.</p>
<p>Our good old Mother, I sometimes think, must have gone to Moffat with Isabella in these days; we heard lately that she was to go, but do not yet hear whether the purpose is fulfilling itself or not. The other day I wrote to Jamie at Scotsbrig, asking him to write; pray write to me, a word on that subject, some of you.</p>
<p>Emerson, as perhaps you know, is gone to America again; left Liverpool by the Steamer of Saturday last. He was very kindly treated here by the people he got among; and is a man who praises everything, and in a languid kind of way is <hi rend="italic">content</hi> with everything. I think he goes home, very happy with his journey hither. I found him very amiable, gentle-minded, sincere of heart; but withal rather <hi rend="italic">moonshiny, un</hi>practical in his speculations, and it must be confessed a little wearisome from time to time! The things and persons he took interest in, were things generally quite of the <hi rend="italic">past tense</hi> with me; and the best I could do generally was to listen to such psalmodyings as those of his <hi rend="italic">without</hi> audibly wishing them at the Devil! He got among a poor washy set of people chiefly, &#x201C;friends of humanity&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A satirical term dating back to at least &#x201C;The Friends of Humanity and the Needy Knife-Grinder,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">The Anti-Jacobin</hi> (<date when="1789">1789</date>), by George Canning.</note> &#x26;c,&#x2014;to keep wide <hi rend="italic">away</hi> from whom is my most necessary struggle here,&#x2014;so in fact I have not had very much relation to him at all; and as he sedulously keeps the peace with all mortals, and really loves me very well, I managed without difficulty to keep the peace to him; and our parting was altogether friendly.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It required all Emerson&#x2019;s love of the man for him to tolerate the despair and negativism frequently expressed by TC. In his notebook Emerson wrote: &#x201C;Carlyle is no idealist in opinions, but a protectionist in political economy, aristocrat in politics, epicure in diet, goes for murder, money, punishment by death, &#x26; all the pretty slavery, &#x26; all the pretty abominations, tempering them with epigrams. His seal holds a griffin with the word, <hi rend="italic">Humilitate.</hi> He is a covenanter-philosophe &#x26; a sansculotte-aristocrat. &#x2026; / He finds nothing so depressing to him as the sight of a great mob. He saw, once, &#x2018;three or four miles of human beings, &#x26; fancied that the <hi rend="italic">airth</hi> was some great cheese, &#x26; these were mites.&#x2019; / It is droll to hear this talker talking against talkers, &#x26; this writer writing against writing. / He has such vigor of constitution that he can dispose of poison very well. He is a bacchanal in the strong waters of vituperation. His talk will often remind you of what was said of Dr Johnson, &#x2018;If his pistol misses fire, he will knock you down with the butt-end.&#x2019; &#x2026; / The literary, the fashionable, &#x26; the political man, each fresh from triumphs in his own sphere, comes eagerly to see this man, whose fun they have so heartily enjoyed,&#x2014;sure of a welcome,&#x2014;and are struck with despair at the first onset. His firm, victorious, cutting, scoffing, vituperative declamation strikes them with chill &#x26; hesitation. / I fancy, too, that he does not care to see anybody whom he cannot eat &#x26; reproduce tomorrow, in his pamphlet or pillory. Alcott was meat he could not eat, &#x26; Margaret F[uller]. likewise, &#x26; he rejected them at once&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks</hi> 10:551&#x2013;53). In his <hi rend="italic">English Traits</hi> Emerson partly elaborated: &#x201C;Carlyle was driven by his disgust at the pettiness and the cant, into the preaching of Fate. In comparison with all the rottenness, any check, any cleansing, though by fire, seemed desirable and beautiful. He saw little difference in the gladiators, or &#x2018;the causes&#x2019; for which they combated; the one comfort was, that they were all going speedily into the abyss together. And his imagination, finding no nutriment in any creation, avenged itself by celebrating the majestic beauty of the laws of decay&#x201D; (249). There remained, however, a great fundamental respect between the two men, and though TC might berate Emerson he could also praise him.</note> Poor Emerson,&#x2014;I shall not see him again;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC did see Emerson again, on his visits to England, <date when="1872">1872</date> and <date when="1873">1873</date>.</note> and, alas, what good <pb id="pg-23-76" n="23:76"/>could the sight of him do me, or of me do him?

<p>Your note and gifts drew tears from me, tho I am not much given to weeping; but I find myself at a loss how to thank you in <hi rend="italic">words.</hi> A proof so sacred of your esteem is indeed more to be <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> than <hi rend="italic">spoken about.</hi> I will only say that, in presenting me with these memorials of one so dear to you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His deceased wife, Marian.

<p><pb id="pg-23-78" n="23:78"/>Come and see us whenever you are in London. We both <hi rend="italic">took to you</hi> from the first evening;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. <date when="1848-04-01">1 April</date>, when Emerson brought him to Cheyne Row. Emerson had stayed with Neuberg when he lectured at Nottingham the previous <date when="1848-12">Dec.</date> (Rusk 3:441; <hi rend="italic">Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks</hi> 10:189), and upon discovering Neuberg&#x2019;s great admiration for TC, promised to bring the two men together. Neuberg said of their first meeting: &#x201C;We were drawn together immediately. We agreed about everything and parted in hopes of meeting again. The revolutions were making both of us then look for the rebirth of the German people, and many a time I have heard him repeat, &#x2018;Long live the German Fatherland!&#x2019;&#x201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:33).</note> for me, I have either a natural or acquired affinity to the sorrowful; that a man have a great and enduring sorrow is enough always to make me his friend. provided that he do not weakly suffer it to master him, and spill his Life. Indeed it is only the sorrowing that I can understand and sympathize with; the people who are &#x201C;at ease in Zion&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amos 6:1.</note> surpass my powers of comprehension, and I fly from them as much as the forms of Society will allow<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This hardly agrees with what B&#xF6;lte wrote to Varnhagen about JWC, <date when="1848-07-24">24 July</date>, explaining that she had missed seeing her on JWC&#x2019;s birthday but had sent flowers: &#x201C;In any case we must make a little pause in our friendship, for while I shall remain devoted to her with the same love, I cannot follow her along the path she has chosen, in order to bring harmony into her life. She wishes to appear to be everything that she is not&#x2014;in order not to upset others as she puts it, and to trouble them with what pleases and saddens her individually. &#x2026; I have begged her to give it up, but she does not want to; she wants to try this. So let her. Let her yield for a while to the influence of those ladies who seek to drill her in these worldly ways, and the result will show how far her heart and mind are satisfied by it. &#x2026; There was a comical scene recently. He [TC] asked her for advice about something, and she replied that he shouldn&#x2019;t do it, because people would think him &#x2018;good-natured,&#x2019; a description that doesn&#x2019;t otherwise suit him. He stared ahead, obviously fighting with a disagreeable emotion, that evidently amounted to not wanting to do without that characteristic. Then he looked up, pursed his lips, and retorted: &#x2018;Well, my dear, we are remarkably well suited to each other; for you neither were ever accused of being good-natured.&#x2019; She agreed, laughing, that this was so. But can I admit to you that this little incident affected me deeply?&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 64&#x2013;65, trans.).</note>&#x2014; So it was, that I could never <hi rend="italic">get up</hi> the least interest or affection for Emerson; for all so <hi rend="italic">amiable</hi> as he is. <closer><salute>And so it is, that I am yours, comparitive stranger as you are to me,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your prompt, copious and authentic Intelligence: you give us a glimpse into the interior movement of things; and one sees, at <pb id="pg-23-79" n="23:79"/>first hand, how the springs work! I am sorry you have still to report of Mary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Austin.</note> that she looks so <foreign><hi rend="italic">dowie</hi></foreign> [sad], weary and dispirited: poor thing, she has always looked to me so, when I have seen her, of late years. Weary and heavy-laden, but without complaint. If it was mere overplus of work, one would hope that the girls, as they came up, might be expected to give her some relief. But I fear, it is bad health as well; she has serious ailments, I suspect, constantly working upon her, either in a declared or secret manner; and that much undermines the spirits. Poor Mary, if any of us could do anything to help her, surely we ought, for she herself had a right kind heart to us all, and I am sure still <hi rend="italic">has</hi>, tho&#x2019; years and troubles and toil have darkened it more than formerly.&#x2014; &#x2014; We had heard from Isabella before your letter came: all still well at Scotsbrig, which surely is a matter to rejoice at. Jenny, cut off from her Town coteries, had arrived safe there, or was hourly expected: poor Jenny, it is very well she can get into some companionship with her &#x201C;professing Christian&#x201D; neighbours: be patient with her little ways, and do her all the good you by any means can. It is certainly no charity to encourage her recollections of past times and vanished scoundrels:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unspecified but connected with her husband, Robert Hanning.</note> yet one must not forget that her poor little lot has been very sad,&#x2014;that a human soul doomed to hang upon a wretched mass of gluttonous Falsity, like that worthless vagabond, is tragically situated! Let us try to bear any corner of her bit burden, poor little Jenny, each of us according to opportunity.</p>
<p>However, I meant only today to write about &#x201C;the House.&#x201D; What house it is on the Troqueer side, I cannot at all remember: was it near the Kirk, or towards the Mill? All that Bank looks always very pleasant to me; and many of the houses, I dare say, are desirable.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken had apparently told TC in advance of the house advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1848-08-08">8 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;The Banks of Troqueer, with a commodious cottage, garden, and offices lying between Rosefield &#x2026; and the Glebe of Troqueer, along the edge of the Nith, immediately opposite the Dock of Dumfries.&#x201D; Troqueer was the parish including Maxwelltown, where Janet Hanning lived. John Carlyle reported critically, <date when="1848-08-18">18 Aug.</date>, after inspecting it, adding, <date when="1848-08-20">20 Aug.</date>, &#x201C;very damp throughout.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; Alas, I doubt it is not <hi rend="italic">much</hi> worth while for James to take a deal of trouble about that house: yet if he could give me some outline of an account concerning it: the number of rooms with dimensions, state of the walls, roof, little field; and then in brief what he thinks the minimum price might be, I should really be obliged. A house to fly to on occasion, in some part of the country or other would surely be very serviceable to myself, and if it suited our good old Mother too, and were &#x201C;worth the money&#x201D; besides all,&#x2014;it would certainly be a temptation. Pray let him answer me about it a little.&#x2014; By the way there are no <hi rend="italic">strokes</hi> on the Newspaper cover today; but that, I hope, means only, He was in <pb id="pg-23-80" n="23:80"/>haste?&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014; The Doctor continues toiling at his task; &#x201C;very nearly done now,&#x201D; yet never quite done. He is in great haste, whenever we see him, either here or at his own rooms: I think he will surely get to you in a fortnight or so (most men would finish his work out in two days!);&#x2014;and certainly it will do him much good to get the shoes torn off him and be turned in to Annandale grass again for a while!</p>
<p>Jane is still feckless, <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> very little; and the weather is so showery she cannot rightly get out for exercise either. <closer><salute>She joins in salutations to you all. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Poor Smith<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> appears to have <supplied>[a]</supplied> heavy burden: but he ought to console himself reflecting that it is the common lot; that mere &#x201C;hard work&#x201D; is of all <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> kinds of fortune the gentlest,&#x2014;and turns most rea<supplied>[d]</supplied>ily to profit if well done.

<p><salute>Sir,&#x2014;</salute>I have received your letter, with the printed documents concerning the Lancashire Public School Association;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forrest reported to the assoc., <date when="1848-08-01">1 Aug.</date>, that he had sent TC the &#x201C;plan&#x201D; and other documents. The plan was pbd. in <hi rend="italic">National Education &#x2026; a series of papers &#x2026; of the Lancashire Public School Association</hi> (<date when="1850">1850</date>) 173&#x2013;99.</note> all of which papers I have read with satisfaction. Accept my thanks for your civilities; and allow me to say, in return, that nobody can wish your enterprise more heartily than I a speedy and perfect success. Speedy or not, I believe success in such an enterprise, if wisely prosecuted, is certain: for the object is great, simple, and legitimate,&#x2014;at once feasible and of prime necessity,&#x2014;and will gradually vindicate that character for itself to every just mind, however prepossessed; so that there needs only candid exposition and discussion,&#x2014;true zeal for the intrinsic result, and openness for every improvement as to the means,&#x2014;to enlist all good citizens in its favour, and bring at length the whole public to co-operate with you.</p>
<p>Surely, in all times, in all places where men are, it is the sacred, indefeasible duty, imposed by Heaven itself and the oldest laws of nature, that they who have knowledge shall seek honestly to impart it to those who have not! No man, no generation of men, has a right to pass through this <pb id="pg-23-81" n="23:81"/>world, and leave their successors in a state of ignorance which could have been avoided. No generation: and if many generations among us English have already too much done so, it is the sadder case for England now, and the more pressing is the call for this generation of Englishmen. In all times and places it is man&#x2019;s solemn <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>, whether done or not;&#x2014;and if in any time or place, I should say it was in Lancashire, in England, in these years that are now passing over us! Years swiftly rolling, laden with rapid events, overturns, and frightful catastrophes,&#x2014;admonishing all men that human darkness issues finally in human ruin; that want of wisdom does at last mean want of the power to exist on this earth, where, as it has been said, &#x201C;If you will not have illumination from above, you shall have conflagration from below, and whoever refuses <hi rend="italic">light</hi> will get it in the form of <hi rend="italic">lightening</hi> one day!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably by TC; cf. <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets, Works</hi> 20:126, 184.</note></p>
<p>True, the mere schoolmaster is a small element of such &#x201C;illumination&#x201D;; but we are never to forget that he is the first element, the indispensable preliminary of all others. Let us have the schoolmaster; we shall then be the readier to try for something more. No truth that he or another can teach us but is supported and confirmed by <hi rend="italic">all</hi> truths. To nothing but error is or can any truth be dangerous. Who would obstruct, who would not cordially forward, a human being imparting to another any increase of real faculty, any real initiation, speculative or practical, into this universe, and its facts and laws, provided he really do impart such, and restrict himself to doing it? To know the multiplication-table, is better than not to know it. If a man will teach another to make a pair of shoes, he will enlarge the faculty, the availability of that other,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> of that other to himself and to all creatures, and to the Maker of all creatures and of him. Teach one another; see that none who could learn go untaught, if you can help him: there is no more universal law.</p>
<p>That jealousy for constitutional liberty, still more that scruples of religion, should obstruct this sacred, everlasting duty, so pressingly important even now, is very sad. Above all, that religion should be found standing on the highways to say, &#x201C;Let men continue ignorant of reading and arithmetic, lest they learn heterodoxy in theology; let not men learn the simplest laws of this universe, lest they mislearn the highest,&#x201C;&#x2014;I know not where else there is seen so altogether tragical a spectacle! &#x201C;In the name of God the Maker, who said and hourly yet says, <hi rend="italic">Let there be light</hi>, we command that you continue in darkness!&#x201D; Such a spectacle, I venture to think, will end; it ought decidedly to end, and that soon. If any portion of a man&#x2019;s creed, religious or constitutional, command him to stand in the way of <pb id="pg-23-82" n="23:82"/>arithmetic and the alphabet, let such portion of his creed become suspect to him!</p>
<p>Of the details of your scheme I do not profess to judge, without more deliberation than is now possible; and indeed my eagerness to see any scheme whatever of national education adopted (for the worst I ever heard of is better than none) might render me liable to partiality in judging. But your two principles, <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, that of popular support and local self-government (to which, in better days, a superior and supreme national superintendency, the fit post for the highest and noblest intellect we had among us, might be superadded); and <hi rend="italic">secondly</hi>, that of excluding all religious teaching but what is unsectarian: these clearly seem to me the only practicable principles at this epoch;&#x2014;an epoch which more than any other calls upon us to &#x201C;practise&#x201D; straightway <hi rend="italic">some</hi> principle or principles, and get a little education accomplished, if we would not fare worse before long!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. TC&#x2019;s paper on &#x201C;National Education&#x201D; in <date when="1835">1835</date>; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350203-TC-NE-01"><sic>8:29&#x2013;36</sic><corr>TC to NE, <date when="1835-02-03">3 Feb. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> <closer><salute>And therefore with my whole heart I bid you persevere and prosper.&#x2014;Yours sincerely,</salute></closer></p>

<p>Wheresoever this Letter find you, let it say credibly, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Valeas</hi></foreign> [Farewell].<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was leaving for Scotland.</note> I have called twice at Clarges Street; and both times, found you absent, in distant opposite quarters.</p>
<p>Your sumptuous Book is in my hands; and, what is more surprising still, I have read it over, with good acceptance, and gratitude not undeserved. This from one so ignorant of Spanish and all kinds of Art, and even at times so ill-affected to &#x201C;Art&#x201D; in general, and to the twaddle it extensively occasions in these days, ought to seem considerable to you. But the truth is, I have got many curious glimpses of Spanish Existence in this Book of yours; strange direct glances into things foreign, things brave and beautiful, tho&#x2019; wild to me, and <hi rend="italic">gnarled</hi> by wonderful perversions; and for all such, as a brother mortal, of Kin to all mortals Spanish and other, I give you thanks accordingly. It is to be added that your style is perfect of its kind; lively, elegant, pleasantly flowing, spiced duly with mild mockery and other <pb id="pg-23-83" n="23:83"/>accepted condiments; furthermore that your work generally gives proof of long faithful research, of continuous labour, exactitude and clear methodic punctuality,&#x2014;qualities and facts highly honourable to the Worker.</p>

On the other hand, it will not surprise you that many very many of the <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> fish in your net were not for my eating at all;&#x2014;and in fact, I should say the one thing your Book wants (were such a thing possible now!) is that the dead of it could be separated from the living; even as I in reading of it, not without industry, contrived to do! Long lists of poor names that neither are nor ought to be familiar to the English reader,&#x2014;what a pity these are not banished into Appendixes, Alphabetical Lists, or even suppressed altogether! I found enough of real metal in the Book to awaken, many a time, the wish that the dead ashes had been riddled out of it; that in some strong furnace-heat it had been fused into an ingot. Let us be thankful, however, that we have it such as it is;&#x2014;as I doubt not you are that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have it not any longer, but we only henceforth. It is the chief comfort of a man in getting done with his Book, which has long hung on him like Christian&#x2019;s Body of Sin (according to Bunyan<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Bunyan, <hi rend="italic">The Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi> (<date when="1678">1678</date>), in which Christian is the protagonist.</note>), joy now that one sees it leap and bound down hill, never to trouble <hi rend="italic">us</hi> any more!</p>
<p>One other thing I must say: I read this Book under perpetual protest on account of the subject. That a Scottish man of your high position and indisputable faculty should go to Spain and to Spanish Painting, or to any kind of &#x201C;Painting&#x201D; or Shadow-manufacture, for a subject, seems to me in these earnest days very sad. Not your blame; no, no, the world&#x2019;s blame, and all our blames; but sad not the less. Depend upon it, my friend, Scotland claims you, and your fine faculty and opportunity; Scotland has a right to you,&#x2014;and will get you yet, if it please the gods! For you are yet young enough to learn, open-minded enough to turn; and by the blessing of Heaven, poor old Scotland may have <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Count von Suhm too, or better, <pb id="pg-23-84" n="23:84"/>which she deserves as well as Denmark did, I apprehend?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Frederik Suhm (<date when="1728">1728</date>&#x2013;<date when="1798">98</date>), author of <hi rend="italic">History of Denmark</hi>, 11 vols.

<p><salute>Dear Eckermann,&#x2014;</salute>About ten days ago I safely received your Third Volume of <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Conversations</hi>]; and have read it, I and others, with very great satisfaction. Many thanks to you, in my own name, for this mark of your continued friendliness, thanks too, in the name of the world, for such a memorial of things really memorable,&#x2014;new traits in the character and habits of a man whom many ages will remember, and of which, but for you, there might have been no record. It does my heart good to get again into company with Goethe, and to live a little while with him again, and hear him &#x201C;tho&#x2019; dead yet speaking.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 1:4.</note> You need not be anxious about the reception of your Book; I believe I can safely promise it a long and honourable life among Books;&#x2014;likely to be alive, I should say, when the Frankfort Parliament, and Louis-Philippe, and the <hi rend="italic">Reichsverweser</hi> himself are pretty much forgotten!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Frankfurt parliament was a general German national assembly elected by universal manhood suffrage in a restricted form and authorized to create a strong federal govt.; it first convened, <date when="1848-05-18">18 May</date>, in Frankfurt. One of its early acts was to appoint the supposedly democratic Archduke Johann of Austria (<date when="1782">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">1859</date>) as <hi rend="italic">Reichsverweser</hi>&#x2014;i.e., regent or imperial administrator&#x2014;to carry on the govt. by means of a ministry selected by himself.</note> It seems to me admirably done,&#x2014;with infinite loyalty, simplicity, clearness; a little Book full of what I call &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">inarticulate genius</hi>,&#x201D; which after all is better than most of the articulate kinds. In fact I love it very much; and have had no pleasanter bit of reading these many months and years.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie B&#xF6;lte wrote Varnhagen, <date when="1848-08-14">14 Aug.</date>, that TC had received the third vol. of the <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che</hi> and given her his copy with his marginal notes. She also said: &#x201C;When Carlyle comes into the room and shakes hands so trustingly and with well meaning, when I sit down beside him and look into his kindly face, then I really feel how highly I think of him. Of course he will always be an Englishman and a long way behind you in his way of thinking; but the core is a diamond, and the rough edges, which make themselves known today in a speech in praise of slavery and tomorrow on the Emperor of Russia, are in the last analysis only passing reflections of a great soul that is seeking the truth, and on the way goes continually a little astray&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 65, trans.).</note>&#x2014; The scenes that turn on <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi>, on the <pb id="pg-23-85" n="23:85"/>habits of Birds &#x26;c, reveal to me a great wealth in you (of which I think Marshall also spoke),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Marshall.</note> which really you should think of turning to farther account in the Literary way. Let the world also share in your beautiful communion with Nature, with the <hi rend="italic">mute</hi> Tribes of the Living! Nothing is more universally interesting; as indeed it may well be: a silent practical worship and recognition of this universe; most welcome in these loud days of mouth-worship and sham-recognition! Do you know a little English Book we have, called White&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Natural History of Selborne?</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gilbert White (<date when="1720">1720</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793">93</date>), English clergyman and naturalist, author of <hi rend="italic">Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</hi> (<date when="1789">1789</date>).</note> It should be in the Duke&#x2019;s Library: if it be not accessible, tell me, and I will get it sent to you. You should do something like it for your own corner of Germany; you really should. It is one of our most excellent Books; White, a quiet country Parson, has preached a better sermon here than all the loud Bishops that then were. Think of it, I pray you.&#x2014; &#x2014; By the bye, speaking of Bishops, I found one passage where you speak of our &#x201C;Bishop of Derby,&#x201D; of which I could make nothing! We have no B<hi rend="italic">p</hi> of Der<hi rend="italic">b</hi>y, nor ever had. However, the error on investigation turns out to be but of one letter: write &#x201C;Bishop of Derry&#x201D; (Londonderry in Ireland), and then it will all answer, and the &#x201C;Lord Bristol&#x201D; too, strange as he looks.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Augustus Hervey (<date when="1730">1730</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803">1803</date>), 4th earl of Bristol, bishop of Derry (<date when="1768">1768</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803">1803</date>).</note> His Lordship really had been a Bishop, or perhaps still was; the interview must have been during the Peace of Amiens,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Peace of Amiens, <date when="1802">1802</date>, marked a brief cessation of war between Britain and France.</note> probably in <date when="1802">1802</date>, for the poor man died <hi rend="italic">next</hi> summer, aged 70,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ein alter Narr</hi></foreign> [an old fool], it would seem; one of a multitude!</p>
<p>Your intelligence about the <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> manuscript was altogether shocking to me! I directly transmitted your Note to the Ritter Bunsen, with due stringency of request to have some light thrown on the business,&#x2014;to have, if nothing else could be got, the manuscript <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> at least.

<salute>Dear Scott,</salute>
<p>A practical, humane, and very intelligent Country Gentleman, a Mr Spedding of the Cumberland region, transmits me the enclosed Excerpt from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, with eager desire to have some farther light in regard to it,&#x2014;some account of the <hi rend="italic">success</hi> of the Project there indicated.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >T. S. Spedding sent the following excerpt from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of <date when="1848-07-26">26 July</date>: &#x201C;Letters from Orleans of the 20th instant state that several thousands of the operatives employed in the national workshops of Paris have been sent into <hi rend="italic">la Sologne</hi> [a marshy district in cent. France], where they can be employed advantageously in reclaiming the waste lands in that district. It is believed that 50,000 men can earn 1 franc 50 centimes a-day (1s.3d.) and add considerably to the wealth of the nation. A severe military discipline has been established amongst those men by the Government Engineers under whose direction they are placed.&#x201D;</note> The principal question would be, Do the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ouvriers</hi></foreign> [workers] actually earn their franc and half daily under those conditions, or are they merely <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> so much daily, and made very miserable in the process? If the former should turn out to be the answer, it would be a great fact for Spedding, and for me, who are continually preaching that method of proceeding with our own <pb id="pg-23-87" n="23:87"/>Paupers, as the real point at which to begin the &#x201C;organisation of Labour&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The name of Louis Blanc&#x2019;s book; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480322-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, [<date when="1848-03-22">22 March</date>]</ref>.</note> here at home. I should like very well to know.</p>
<p>As there is nobody in France of whom I could conveniently ask the question, and I am somewhat at a loss how to proceed, it strikes me that there is perhaps possibility of getting an answer thro&#x2019; some of your Parisian connexions, which are of a more recent date than mine. I beg you to make inquiry if you can, and let me know the result. If you cannot, the question must lie in abeyance for the present.</p>
<p>We have never seen you at Chelsea yet; but as we are here thro&#x2019; the whole of <date when="1848-08">August</date>, I will certainly come and try in your quarter<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Woolwich.</note> if you do not make your appearance soon in ours.

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>Your question about the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ouvriers</hi></foreign> [Workers] on the Sologne has been propounded to me by one or two oracles; but there is no response hitherto, nor any clear road towards one. I have put it on the road to France itself for an answer: if any come, you may depend on hearing of it; nor will it go out of my head while there remains a chance of getting light upon it. The prevailing opinion is, that these men on the Waste Lands (as many others upon the Railways &#x26;c) are <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> their franc and half <hi rend="italic">daily</hi>, but whether they earn it or not,&#x2014;except as our Paupers &#x201C;earn&#x201D; their ration by consuming soot along with it,&#x2014;seems to be very questionable to everybody.</p>
<p>I myself grow in the belief that here is the actual <foreign><hi rend="italic">punctum saliens</hi></foreign> [salient point] of new life and salvation for us and for all modern societies; that we ought to begin here, by regimenting and reducing to stringent military <pb id="pg-23-88" n="23:88"/>rule (strict as death both against commanders and commanded) all labourers that cannot find employment and choose to enlist with us; that hereby were a new improved Serfhood and Earlhood, adapted to the new ages, actually started,&#x2014;by faithfully prosecuting which into all its wide expansions, sternly exterminating all cant and <hi rend="italic">non</hi>-performance as we went along, the whole accursed quagmire and rotten cloaca of modern Society might <hi rend="italic">be</hi> with a minimum of violence be got drained and purified again, and from Eton School to the top of Lambeth mitre all delusions and damnabilities might gradually die out of it, and, one thrice-glorious day, be found <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>, O, ye Heavens!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lambeth is the London residence of the archbishop of Canterbury.</note> This, really, in all sobriety, is my opinion; tho&#x2019; hitherto I have found nobody but you that would agree with me. Why not speak of it, write of it?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC was to write of it in <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 20:42&#x2013;44), as he had recently in &#x201C;Irish Regiments (of the New &#xc6;ra)&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480519-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1848-05-19">19 May</date></ref>). Spedding had also been thinking of doing so, and wrote to his brother, James, <date when="1848-05-31">31 May</date>: &#x201C;I cannot get Carlyle&#x2019;s regiments of labour licked into shape by my mind&#x2019;s tongue&#x2014; The very beginning requires more concurrence &#x26; co-operation of many classes than can be hoped for in England. I am clear he should begin somewhere in the Colonies. &#x2026; Peel Carlyle Chadwick a Board of Emigration &#x26; Labour! The Home experiment could best be made by Somerset House &#x26; Charles Buller substituting my Labour test for the Workhouse&#x2014;&#x26; suppressing the vagrant and mendicant Lazzaroni with a resolute hand.&#x201D; Spedding, who had already written <hi rend="italic">Letters on the Poor Law</hi> (<date when="1847">1847</date>), interestingly saw TC as braving red tape to become a civil servant or administrator, as TC may even have fancied himself. See K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Carlyle and the Speddings&#x2014;New Letters II,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 8 (<date when="1987">1987</date>):51&#x2013;66, for Spedding&#x2019;s letters to TC.</note> Alas it is a thing not so much to be written of, as to be set about and done! A man grows weary sitting on the streets demonstrating the possibility of motion, with his own feet gyved. And all the crowd, who with a grin on their countenances cry out &#x201C;Well done!&#x201D; and do not, one of them, stir from the spot, are but a small help or encouragement. The truth is, I said the thing ought to be <hi rend="italic">faithfully</hi> prosecuted; and how among a generation of poor canting mortals, <hi rend="italic">blind</hi> to the eternal sacredness of this universe and to all reverence to one another except a cowardly lip-reverence, and in fact reduced to the condition (it is too sad a truth!) of &#x201C;enchanted apes,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:218.</note> with their ballot-boxes &#x26;c.,&#x2014;do anything whatever &#x201C;faithfully&#x201D;? They are infidels to the marrow of the bone;&#x2014;and I suppose that nothing but black unendurable <hi rend="italic">misery</hi> will make them so much as try to get disenchanted: God mend them! Besides all which, I am threatening to get quite demoralised myself, altogether weary, weak and ready to sit down and weep in the great solitude that is round me.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here is a Note which you can at any time present to Mr Parker,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. W. Parker.</note> with <pb id="pg-23-90" n="23:90"/>whatever Manuscript you may wish to make trial of in that quarter. If when your Paper is ready, you consider that another form of Introductory Note might be more suitable, pray apply to me freely again. That, or any other modest service I could render you, is much your due from me.&#x2014; &#x2014; If Parker (which I hope will not be the case) do after all reject your first <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi>, you are by no means to be discouraged; endeavour to gather from him, by all the inspection you can muster, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> it is that he objects to in your Paper; there is light for a brave man in every such <hi rend="italic">rejection</hi>, even in a stupid one, which Parkers&#x2019;s is by no means likely to be: he that would live in Rome, it will infallibly be good that he know what the Pope thinks of him, whatever <hi rend="italic">he</hi> may think of the Pope!</p>
<p>Did you ever think of America as a field? A man has liberty to preach (I mean by word of mouth) much beyond what the pulpits, of any complexion, will concede to him in this country. I spoke with Emerson about you in that point of view: he did not seem to think it quite unhopeful; wished you could get a fair trial made,&#x2014;&#x201C;six months in the country with merely your staff in your hand&#x201D;;&#x2014;after which, if the auguries were fair, a comfortable settlement, and good success every way, were possible enough.</p>
<p>We do not expect to leave Town till <date when="1848-09">September</date>; I am generally at home and disengaged in the evenings.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I believe I once spoke to you, last year, about the unfortunate &#x201C;Ecclefechan Station&#x201D; on the Caledonian Railway. It appears now, contrary to what I supposed, that the matter is still <hi rend="italic">un</hi>decided; that the people of the village are &#x201C;raising subscriptions&#x201D; (very scanty, I doubt!)&#x2014;and in the meantime, &#x201C;wheeling their coals down in barrows&#x201D; the additional distance, poor souls;&#x2014;in fine, that I ought myself to subscribe, and also to make some representation of the matter to those who have power over it. Both of which things,&#x2014;the image of those miserable &#x201C;coal barrows&#x201D; urging me,&#x2014;I have decided to do.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had written to TC from Scotsbrig, <date when="1848-08-11">11 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;The people of Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> are still striving to get the Station removed to the Langlands, just above Jamie Moffats. The other station will not be finished at Swaugh till the matter is determined. &#xa3;200 are necessary for the removal &#x26; upwards of &#xa3;100 have been subscribed. A little assistance would carry the point &#x26; get the station put where it ought to be. Should we not subscribe something for the sake of our old village? All the poor have to bring their coal-fuel from the Swaugh <hi rend="italic">in wheelbarrows.</hi> Could you not write to Charles Stewart? It would be a real piece of charity to get the poor people relieved from such a gross injustice.&#x201D; For the Swaugh station, see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471002-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1847-10-02">2 Oct. 1847</date></ref>; it was nr. the farm of Saughpark.</note></p>
<p>Let me ask you therefore to present the inclosed Note, with my respectful compliments, to Mr Hope Johnston, by the first good opportunity; and to say for the request contained in it, in that and all other quarters, what favourable word you can. I have stated the case with all the exactness I could: a case of decided and evident <hi rend="italic">mistake</hi>,&#x2014;which therefore all men that can help to remedy, do <hi rend="italic">well</hi> in helping.&#x2014; On the whole, I will hope, when the Steam Vehicle next sets me down in Annandale, it may be at the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> place (approved of by men and gods) and not at the wrong (<hi rend="italic">dis</hi>approved of by ditto), as last time!</p>
<p>Our potatoes are all rotting here, as everywhere; and our beautiful corn is all lying in disastrous heaps, under continual rain. This has been the <hi rend="italic">greyest</hi> summer I ever saw in these parts; warm too, but wonderfully sunless. Ireland, with its rotten potatoes, and rusty pikes, will be in a precious mess again! &#x201C;Missionaries&#x201D; of that Nation,&#x2014;so I call the unfortunate ragged scoundrels that come over hither to make <hi rend="italic">us</hi> as miserable as they themselves are,&#x2014;have abounded all summer in London Streets, which is quite a new phasis here. I often ask myself, How <hi rend="italic">long</hi> Lord John Russel thinks the ship can continue smoking thro&#x2019; every seam and porthole <pb id="pg-23-92" n="23:92"/>before the flame bursts above deck; and whether it can be a pleasant occupation to steer it as if all were right <hi rend="italic">till</hi> then!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>This Autumn I hardly expect to get into Annandale; but if I do, shall certainly see you, and I hope, at greater length than last time. <closer><salute>Pray remember me very kindly at Gillenbie to both the kind Friends there; and do not yourself quite forget me till we meet again.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your punctual Note which we rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> on Saturday Night:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Written <date when="1848-08-11">11 Aug.</date>, received <date when="1848-08-12">12 Aug.</date></note> it was strange to us, all Friday, that you were to sup at Scotsbrig that night after breakfasting in Chelsea, among such a foreign class of objects!&#x2014; We are heartily thankful to hear again of our good Mother, and that you found her so well. No gladder thing, I fancy, could happen to her than the sight of you once again in this world!&#x2014; You must take to a serious examination of Jamie, and really try whether you cannot help him somewhat.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had said that Jamie was &#x201C;not in good health,&#x201D; though he had &#x201C;had little talk with him as yet.&#x201D; Jenny Hanning was staying at Scotsbrig as Isabella was at Moffat.</note> I guess, his ailment is the family one, that of <hi rend="italic">liver;</hi> in which case it seems next to certain some considerable good could be done him in the way of regimen and diet, of which hitherto he has been quite careless. Try, try!</p>
<p>We have nothing here but incessant splashes, rain from all <foreign><hi rend="italic">airts</hi></foreign> [directions],&#x2014;from the <hi rend="italic">east</hi> today; yesterday Scotch mist, from no <hi rend="italic">airt</hi>, or from all;&#x2014;and so on. Anthony Sterling reports the condition of the crops, all lying out cut in this weather, as very questionable.</p>
<p>We had W. Coningham here yesterday afternoon, with whom (to turn him to some account) I went to walk. He also, it appears, he and his Wife are for <hi rend="italic">Keir;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Coningham (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884">84</date>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391024-TC-MAC-01"><sic>11:207</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1839-10-24">24 Oct. 1839</date></corr></ref>), John Sterling&#x2019;s cousin; m. to Elizabeth Catherine, b. Merrick (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401015-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:287</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-15">15 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>). With his enthusiastic interest in fine art (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440127-JWC-JW-01"><sic>17:251&#x2013;53</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1844-01-27">27 Jan. 1844</date></corr></ref>), Coningham would have been welcome by William Stirling at Keir; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480224-TC-WS-01">TC to WS, <date when="1848-02-24">24 Feb.</date></ref></note> to be there &#x201C;about the end of this month&#x201C;: you, if you go (as would be fit), keep off that particular date!&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane and I do tolerably well here, now that everybody is gone: I think it is among the <hi rend="italic">quietest</hi> places one could expect to find at this season.</p>
<p>What you said of the poor bodies &#x201C;wheeling their coals&#x201D; at Ecclefechan <pb id="pg-23-93" n="23:93"/>was sad enough to me; hopeful however that the Error, as would appear, is still remediable! Certainly I will subscribe to help the poor bodies; put down your name and my own for whatever sum you find to be suitable, the same for each. And here, you perceive, is a most <hi rend="italic">handfast</hi> Statement of the case, drawn up by me today; which I hope may do some good when presented! You can read it as it passes;&#x2014;it will only cost a day&#x2019;s detention, and one penny stamp:&#x2014;if there be any <hi rend="italic">error</hi> committed by me of sufficient importance, I wish you would yourself take some opportunity (straightway) of rectifying it to C. Stewart himself; but I do not think there is.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the note to Hope Johnstone, enclosed to Charles Stewart; see preceding letter. John Carlyle reported, <date when="1848-08-18">18 Aug.</date>, reading it to Dr. Archibald Arnott (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270419-TC-JWCGW-01"><sic>4:218</sic><corr>TC to JWCGW, <date when="1827-04-19">19 April 1827</date></corr></ref>), whose land would be needed for any new station; he corrected some of TC&#x2019;s estimated distances and committed TC and himself to &#xa3;10 each, &#x201C;less would hardly be adequate testimonial.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Anne is going to be married,&#x2014;lover and she go to Jersey, where living is cheap, resources abundant; and so they will venture: not for a month or two however, that &#x201C;Missus&#x201D; be put to no inconvenience. It is probably just as well,&#x2014;after that hysterical development!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480611-JWC-LA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A.</sic><corr>LA</corr>, [<date when="1848-06-11">11 June</date>]</ref>, for Anne Brown&#x2019;s &#x201C;accidents.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>My Dear</salute>
<p>Having constituted yourself a little Providence for your friends you must take the consequence of being applied to in all sorts of contingencies. But you are a rash, <hi rend="italic">slap-dash</hi> Providence and your interventions often miscarry thro this over-zeal. So I pray you not only to come to my aid with your good intentions, but to do it with a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> practical deliberation. My maid is going away and I must have another&#x2014; The reasons for my parting with her need not be stated here&#x2014;enough that she is to go&#x2014;and I must again endure the horrors of a household revolution&#x2014;a hateful thought; just now, whilst I am still confined to the house, and good for so little in it.</p>
<p>By communicating my want to the Tradespeople&#x2014;or by putting an Advertisement in the newspapers I might have plenty of servants sent me <hi rend="italic">to look</hi> at&#x2014;but such over-plenty! and a chance whether <hi rend="italic">one</hi> would be found among them worth the trouble of investigating&#x2014;and this year I have not <pb id="pg-23-94" n="23:94"/>poor Christie to receive the whole swarm and send <hi rend="italic">me</hi> only such as seemed to have some feasibility for my purposes.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Christie screened applicants when Anne Brown was hired; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461223-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>21:118</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1846-12-23">23 Dec. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Miss Wynne has a Welsh-woman out of a situation, of whom she spoke to me some time since, in case of my hearing of a place for her;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie B&#xF6;lte wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1848-08-14">14 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;As Mrs. Carlyle is anxious to read everything about the &#x2018;rights and position of Women,&#x2019; I have given her the book by Miss Fuller, and she said to me yesterday that it was hateful; we were both glad we had not written it&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 65, trans.). This was Sarah Fuller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Women of the Nineteenth Century</hi> (<date when="1844">1844</date>).</note> but she does not think her adequate to <hi rend="italic">my own</hi> service. Tho&#x2019; she says so much good of her that I have pressed her to let me at least judge of her with my own two eyes.</p>
<p>It would be a kindness to me then; if you would inquire among your acquaintance if what M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller calls &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a treasure</hi>&#x201D; be known to any of them. You should know by this time the sort of person I need&#x2014;and such a one is more likely to be heard of among your <hi rend="italic">poorer</hi> acquaintance than the rich ones&#x2014;a servant out of <hi rend="italic">a fine house</hi> would not content herself in mine nor could I ever reconcile myself to the ways of such a one. If you hear of any, write to me and tell me her particulars <hi rend="italic">before</hi> sending her here&#x2014;for there is great awkwardness in refusing any one <hi rend="italic">sent</hi>, when one dont like her on examination.</p>
<p>There are <hi rend="italic">Servants Homes</hi> and Places I believe where one can have choice on paying something But I am not well enough to venture out yet on such errands&#x2014;my cough has been worse of late days and I have had mustard blisters on and been bothered considerably&#x2014;</p>
<p>Lady Harriet was here yesterday and met Miss Wynne at the parlour door&#x2014; I never saw two such tall women in my room together.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have just finished the second Volume of <hi rend="italic">Knox</hi>, which came to me, in the old beneficent manner, some three weeks ago; and surely I have to return you many thanks for that new Gift.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vol. 2 of <hi rend="italic">The Works of John Knox</hi>, ed. D. Laing, 6 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1846">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864">64</date>), concluded <hi rend="italic">The History of the Reformation in Scotland.</hi> TC had already thanked Laing for vol. 1; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470618-TC-DL-01"><sic>21:235&#x2013;36</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1847-06-18">18 June 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> You have done me, and all true <pb id="pg-23-95" n="23:95"/>souls that can read this Book, a real pleasure and benefit; truly it is a long while since I have had such a bit of wholesome genuine and fruitful reading! One of the <hi rend="italic">truest</hi> Books evidently; and to a high degree significant of the Writer too. I never saw Knox half so clearly before. A strange vein of rough rustic <hi rend="italic">geniality</hi> runs thro&#x2019; the earnest prophetic man; vivid picturesque touches, shining like bits of native gold; raspings of honest pungent sarcasm, sardonic banter, a genuine sense of humour and ridicule (which is one of the things I like best in Knox);&#x2014;on the whole, a most <hi rend="italic">vernacular</hi> man; <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> every fibre of him, Scotch to the marrow of the bone! And certainly a better Scotchman, of his kind, was never yet made, that I heard of.&#x2014; Assure yourself you do a right good service, to this and all future times, in making such a man legible again.</p>
<p>I find the Edition excellently done, so far. Type and paper altogether what they should be; the printing faithfully cared for,&#x2014;I hardly noticed half a dozen errors of any kind whatever, and only one (bottom of p. 158, <foreign><hi rend="italic">quhilk</hi></foreign> [which] for <foreign><hi rend="italic">quhill</hi></foreign> [until]) w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> gave me a moment&#x2019;s difficulty. This is a great matter in such a Book. The Annotations, embodying such a mass of reading in the briefest compass, are as I believe models of exactitude; I found the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> a little heavy now and then, and was sometimes forced to skip till I had finished the topic in the Text, and then revert: an inconvenience doubtless, but one very difficult to avoid. The question struck me, Whether a good deal could not be done by some kind of well-devised <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>, biographical, historical, topographical, in the shape of a Dictionary, put down once for all at the beginning or in some conspicuous part of the work, ready for <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> reference, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> the reader required it, and not otherwise? Ask yourself with all rigour, What an ordinary reader will require to be aware of in order to understand what this Author says? and give the reader that, and scrupulously no more than that, by way of <foreign><hi rend="italic">viaticum</hi></foreign>, once for all, before he <hi rend="italic">start?</hi> I think such a &#x201C;Dictionary&#x201D; need not be of great extent; it might contain most of what now stands in those Notes (a great advantage), should have accurate reference to every <hi rend="italic">page</hi> where the given name is mentioned;&#x2014;and would, there is no doubt at all, be a great <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi> if you found it possible. What say you? I pray think whether this is not feasible. There will be needed a much more perfect <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>, at any rate, than the one we now have; far more minute, and with indication not only of the pages, but also briefly of what is said there. If you could construct such a &#x201C;Dictionary,&#x201C;&#x2014;exact <hi rend="italic">Chronology</hi> of the main historical events, and complete repertory, with necessary explanation, of all that <pb id="pg-23-96" n="23:96"/>the names that occur,&#x2014;it would decidedly be worth doing; and all future Editors might learn of you!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laing had included a Glossary, Index of Persons, and Index of Places; and vol. 6, pt. 2, was to carry a detailed General Index of the kind described by TC, as well as Indices of Names and Places for vols. 3&#x2013;6. He did not give a &#x201C;Dictionary&#x201D; or &#x201C;Chronology.&#x201D; He had given &#x201C;Chronological Notes&#x201D; on Knox&#x2019;s life in vol. 1 and was to give a short life in vol. 6.</note> But I know, it is much easier to say than to do,&#x2014;in this as in so many other cases!</p>
 <p>I found the <hi rend="italic">Glossary</hi> a little scanty, too (since there was to be a Glossary); but did not much object to that. I think there was no word I did not finally make out; tho&#x2019; several times I turned to the Glossary for help, and found nothing. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Jefwellis</hi>&#x201D; (in Vol. I) was quite mysterious to me; neither did Jamieson, when I ran to him, quite remove the difficulty: at length one day, not many months ago, in some crowded street here, the old Annandale word &#x201C;jaffle&#x201D; came into my head; and I asked myself If perhaps his Majesty had not meant that? Annandale &#x201C;jaffle&#x201D; has borrowed something, I think, from &#x201C;whiffle&#x201D; and &#x201C;shuffle,&#x201D; and other such words ending in the mute <hi rend="italic">fl;</hi> but I take it to be a genuine old word; and it was copiously in use, and still is, in that quarter. To &#x201C;jaffle,&#x201D; to lounge and saunter (paving Hell with good resolutions!), to promise and not perform, expect and not see fulfilled; &#x201C;jaffler,&#x201D; &#x201C;poor jaffling bodie,"&#x2014;these, in that same sense, are phrases one still often hears. The people in that quarter say &#x201C;snaffle,&#x201D; too; but that means, I think, to &#x201C;bungle <hi rend="italic">with haste</hi>,&#x201D; to &#x201C;fidget and ineffectually try&#x201D;; and, except by the <hi rend="italic">fl</hi>, is not related to &#x201C;jaffle.&#x201C;&#x2014; These sublime fractions of etymology came into my head as I say; and I decided to impart them to you, the rather as they seem to confirm what your own surmise upon the matter is.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Jamieson, <hi rend="italic">An Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language</hi>, 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1808">1808</date>), defined &#x201C;jevel, jefwel, javell&#x201D; as a contemptuous term, proper meaning now lost, citing (1:258) Knox&#x2019;s use: &#x201C;The malice and device of thei jefwellis,&#x201D; said <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Mary of Guise, queen regent, not <hi rend="italic">by</hi> &#x201C;His Majesty.&#x201D; Laing glossed it as &#x201C;knaves, or a contemptuous expression, equivalent to &#x2018;jailbird,&#x2019; derived from javel, jeffel, jail or prison.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; And so I wind up my criticisms, which I think have no merit except that of being sincere (which ought not be so rare a merit as it is); and with new thanks, and new Good-speed, bid you persevere in the name of all the world.&#x2014; Somebody of some importance said to me not long since, The Wodrow Society was far ahead of all others in publishing good Books;&#x2014;out of sight of all the <hi rend="italic">others</hi> (who indeed linger balefully <hi rend="italic">below</hi> the horizon, in the mere twilight of <hi rend="italic">dilettantism &#x26;</hi>c), that is my judgement of the case.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Wodrow Soc. (est. <date when="1841">1841</date>, dissolved <date when="1848">1848</date>) pbd. the first two vols. of the <hi rend="italic">Works;</hi> vols. 3 and 4 were printed for the defunct Wodrow Soc. by Johnstone &#x26; Hunter, and vols. 5 and 6 were pbd. by T. G. Stevenson. The Ballantyne Club pbd. a limited edn. of all six vols., as arranged by Laing, who was its sec.</note></p>
<p>About a year ago you wrote to me concerning a Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> who meant to <pb id="pg-23-97" n="23:97"/>examine some <hi rend="italic">Welshiana</hi> now under my keeping at Dumfries: I straightway despatched the Introductory Note &#x26;c, as you prescribed; but did not hear whether the Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> made use of it;&#x2014;that he obtained no certainty by means of it, I infer without hearing.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Material and gentleman untraced.</note> My Wife now subjoins to those surmises of mine, which she did not hear of last year, the confident recollection (liable to verification, however!) that by indication in those old Papers it appeared her Great-grandfather had actually possessed a bit of <hi rend="italic">Coliston</hi> Estate, and had sold it (probably about a century ago), as her Grandfather, at a later period, did another big portion of his property on that same side of the ground.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her grandfather, John Welsh (<date when="1757">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823">1823</date>), and great grandfather, presumably also John.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You had a very short return from me to your last Letter; wherefore I determine to take the top of the morning today before the week end, and fling you off a word or two in addition to what you had. We have no news at all; but our good Mother and the rest of you may be gratified by hearing even that.</p>
 <p>Laurence did not succeed with my portrait; after four laborious sittings, he yesterday decided to abandon it, and to resume another (laid by formerly), which <hi rend="italic">another</hi> sitting now will rid me of! Poor Laurence works terribly; but a vein of ineffectuality, a trying to do the <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>, is apt to run thro&#x2019; his enterprises. For the rest, these sittings do me little or no mischief at present; he lets me even <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> while he paints; I have a good walk to and from, and my day otherwise, I am sorry to say, is still very much of an <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> one. In fact, I still sit upon the brink here, and feel loth and uncertain about plunging in. Things, one may hope, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> ripen with me; alas, I feel I shall have to be very miserable again before they do! For the present, I sit in the utmost attainable silence; alone with my own thoughts and remembrances great part of every day, and certainly in <hi rend="italic">as</hi> secluded a scene as the autumn could well offer me anywhere. Till after that visit to the Grange, which is to begin about the 1st Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (day not yet fixed), I feel there will nothing be done, but at best a little reading. The weather too continues moist and cool; far from unpleasant to me, if it were not so unpromising to others.&#x2014; Little Jeannie enjoys herself very well here, and seems to be as cheery a little creature as ever, able to do well and employ herself on nothing here as well as elsewhere. On Thursday last Forster gave us (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>r at least) an invaluable treat: an Opera box namely, to hear Jenny Lind sing farewell. Illustrious indeed. We dined with Fuz at five, the hospitablest of men; at eight, found the Temple of the Muses all a-shine for Lind and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>,&#x2014;the piece, La <hi rend="italic">Sonnambula</hi>, a chosen bit of nonsense from beginning to end,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vincenzo Bellini&#x2019;s opera <hi rend="italic">La Sonnambula</hi> (first performed <date when="1831">1831</date>) was presented, <date when="1848-08-24">24 Aug.</date>, the last night of the season, at Her Majesty&#x2019;s Theatre, with Jenny Lind in the title role.</note>&#x2014;and, I suppose, an audience of some three thousand <hi rend="italic">expensive</hi>-looking fools male and female come to see this Swedish Nightingale &#x201C;hop the twig,&#x201D; as I phrased it. Nothing could exceed my ennui; especially as we staid till the very finish, little Jeannie being quite delighted. Lind seemed to me a very true, clear, genuine little creature, <pb id="pg-23-99" n="23:99"/>with a voice of extraordinary <hi rend="italic">extent</hi> and <hi rend="italic">little</hi> richness of tone; who sang, acted &#x26;c with consummate fidelity,&#x2014;but had unfortunately nothing but mere <hi rend="italic">non</hi>sense to sing or act; a defect not much felt by the audience, as would appear, but very heavily pressing upon me for one. &#x201C;Depend upon it,&#x201D; I said to Fuz, &#x201C;the Devil is busy <hi rend="italic">here</hi> tonight, wherever he may be idle!&#x201D;&#x2014; Old Wellington had come staggering in to attend the thing.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Wellesley (<date when="1769">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">1852</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29001"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st duke of Wellington.</note> Thackeray was there; d&#x2019;Orsay, Lady Blessington,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marguerite, countess of Blessington (<date when="1789">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">1849</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2640"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), author and society figure with whom Count D&#x2019;Orsay lived; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360502-TC-JSM-01"><sic>8:339</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1836-05-02">2 May 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> to all of whom (Well<hi rend="italic">n</hi> excepted!) I had to be presented, and grin some kind of foolery,&#x2014;much ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the grain. It was one o&#x2019;clock when we got home: on the whole, I do not design to hear Lind again; it would not bring me sixpence worth of benefit, I think, to hear her sing six months in that kind of material! Ah, me; the Sons of Adam are a strange fraternity!&#x2014; We are next to go and dine with Thackeray, who has been at Spa<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spa is in Belgium, 17 mi. SE of Li&#xE8;ge. Thackeray had been on the Continent, <date when="1848-07-26">26 July</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-08-19">19 Aug.</date></note> and back again; not a lovely outlook either. Yesternight Lewis and his Wife came in:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. H. Lewes, m., <date when="1841">1841</date>, to Agnes, b. Jervis (<date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1902">1902</date>). She had four sons by Lewes, the last on <date when="1848-05-11">11 May</date>, and four children by Thornton Hunt, <date when="1850">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857">57</date>, the first three before separation from Lewes. She had contributed to <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, <date when="1846">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847">47</date>.</note> spite of the &#x201C;emptiness&#x201D; of London, there is still company enough and to spare, as would seem,&#x2014;if it were worth anything!</p>
<p>Hunter has been here;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hunter, the Edinburgh lawyer.</note> but did not find us in, neither had his card any address on it so that matter rests there. Chorley I see sometimes, who punctually inquires after you.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Rutter Chorley had been sec. of the Liverpool-Birmingham Grand Junction Railway before his move to London.</note> Masson and Edinburgh people also were here.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Masson; others unidentified.</note> Chorley volunteered (sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> occasion offer) to speak to the Caledonian-Railway Engineer, whom he knows, about that &#x201C;Station&#x201D; business at Ecclefechan. I hope you are going on with that? It should decidedly be mended; and now is the time for it.&#x2014; I found &#x201C;the white owl&#x201D; sitting solitary the other day, but could get no Books from him,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Cochrane, at the London Library.</note>&#x2014;all &#x201C;out, unfortunately.&#x201D; Craik does not turn up since you went away; Fergus has never returned:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Fergus.</note> Tom Holcroft wrote to me to recommend him to Buller ("for an Inspectorship,&#x201D; alas!)<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Buller as chief poor law commissioner.

 <p>Dear Brother, I must prepare to end my foolish <hi rend="italic">screed</hi> here. I have read Knox&#x2019;s second volume, sent by Laing; an excellent Book.

He noted in his Journal, <date when="1848-07-12">12 July</date>: &#x201C;Yesterday notice came that C. G. Duffy &#x2026; is arrested, to be tried as a <hi rend="italic">felon:</hi> for him too, what other was there alas?&#x201D; Lord Clarendon had purposely worked to divide Duffy and Mitchel; but with the latter&#x2019;s transportation, Duffy abandoned his moderation and nonviolence. On his arrest, when crowds surrounded the police van taking him to prison, he rejected an offer to rescue him. At the end of July an uprising broke out, distinguished by an encounter between Smith O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s followers and the police at Ballingarry, S Ireland; its leaders were arrested and tried. TC continued his friendship for Duffy but deeply disapproved of these immediate developments. His argument was that Britain was responsible for Ireland and that the repeal agitation had no hope of success and only deepened their divisions. He gave up writing on the subject until &#x201C;Ireland and Sir Robert Peel,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> 22, no. 1085 (<date when="1849-04-14">14 April 1849</date>) 343&#x2013;44.</note>&#x2014;and sometimes think I had better not send this either, such rubbish as it is.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We are just on the point of setting off on our Hampshire expedition,&#x2014;this is Thursday night, 10 o&#x2019;clock, and we go tomorrow morning at 11;&#x2014;but before shutting up for the night, I will write a single word to tell my dear Mother that such is the case; and that in about 2 days another little Letter may be expected from me, dated the Grange, if all go well.</p>
 <p>Little Jeannie Welsh went off this morning, after rather a pleasant visit, for herself &#x2018;I think, and for us. All day, of course, there has been nothing but sorrowful turmoil; packing, sorting, gathering tobacco and other stores &#x26;c &#x26;c. Our Trunks are now in a forward condition; and Jane indeed has set the whole house in <hi rend="italic">travelling</hi> or <hi rend="italic">absentee</hi> order,&#x2014;for there are paperhangers, painters coming directly when we go, and things require to be locked out of their road. Alas, it is a sad weary business, this of shifting from place to place, and every year I grow <foreign><hi rend="italic">swearer</hi></foreign> [more reluctant] to set <pb id="pg-23-102" n="23:102"/>about it. I think I would gladly give a five-pounds to be off from this journey altogether! But that will not do either; so we must go, and take the best care of ourselves we can.&#x2014; How long we stay is not fixed at all; but I guess about 3 weeks, or perhaps a fortnight. There are Marquises of Landsdown ministers &#x26;c &#x26;c talked of;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Petty Fitzmaurice (<date when="1780">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863">1863</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22071"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390117-TC-JF-01"><sic>11:6</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1839-01-17">17 Jan. 1839</date></corr></ref>), 3d marquess of Lansdowne, pres. of the council, and other ministers.</note> but I have found by experience <hi rend="italic">they</hi> do not differ from little people, except in the <hi rend="italic">clothing</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mounting</hi>,&#x2014;not to say that they are terribly troublesome with their flunkeys and strict fashions, over and above!</p>
<p>We had two bright beautiful days, and all the world rejoiced at the &#x201C;taking up&#x201D; of the weather; but, alas, this evening there arose a thunderstorm, loud and black for two hours, and there has fallen ever since an incessant deluge of rain! It is a sad outlook for the harvest; people are becoming very anxious about that,&#x2014;especially taking the Irish potatoe into view. There is every appearance of a tragic winter again with that fatal people.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Until the middle of <date when="1848-06">June</date> the weather in Ireland had been favorable to the potato crop; but the rain set in, and by <date when="1848-07">mid-July</date> the potato plants had become withered and blackened, almost every district affected.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>According to engagement I send you a word, to announce our safe arrival here, and salute you all at Scotsbrig from our new quarters. I did intend to write yesterday; but found there was <hi rend="italic">no post</hi> on Saturday: we are a day behind London,&#x2014;a day farther off you than London is;&#x2014;so till now there was no possibility of writing.</p>
<p>We made a slight mistake, owing to a <hi rend="italic">change</hi> in the Railway Station, on Friday morning; and had in consequence to go a little farther down the river, and wait an hour or more for a <hi rend="italic">new train:</hi> (Jack will understand the business well enough): but the weather was fine, and the next train did take us beautifully along, and what was still less to be expected, the <pb id="pg-23-103" n="23:103"/>judicious Coachman (fancying how it might be) was still in waiting for us at <hi rend="italic">this</hi> end of our steam-route,&#x2014;all turned out perfectly well, and there was as good as no mistake whatever. They quizzed me a little here, for not knowing what was so public &#x26;c &#x26;c; but that was all the damage. Everybody seemed glad to see us here, especially our Host and Hostess; they have put us into excellent quiet rooms; the weather has been bright as diamonds ever since we quitted Chelsea; and the Country itself, and the House and Park are looking their very best: so that hitherto all goes as well as it could do. I have got <hi rend="italic">tobacco</hi> in abundance, and even <hi rend="italic">pipes</hi>,&#x2014;and a cunning place to keep them in out of doors! One thing we cannot much expect here, and that is very valuable,&#x2014;quiet! But I mean to study all I can the ways of the place, and try to secure my forenoons (till 2 o&#x2019;clock) rigorously to myself, and to some kind of useful reading; after that, I shall be at the service of the public;&#x2014;if I can manage so, it will do. The first night, in spite of the absolute silence, and my temperance at dinner, I did not sleep: it was a strange thing to lie thinking of you all in the deep night here, and have Scotsbrig and the ever dear ones there all present in a place so foreign to them! Last night, however, I made a fair sleep, and indeed today feel wonderfully well. I look out of my two big windows here (which are generally flung up) northwards into deep masses of wood with avenues and green-sward (the principal entrance thro&#x2019; the Park) all in beautiful sunshine and solitude, and silent except for the twittering of some birds, and occasionally the caw of some distant rooks, not yet quite fallen dumb: I could sit whole hours, if they would let me alone, and converse only with my own confused thoughts, and try to let them <hi rend="italic">settle</hi> a little within me. That is very wholesome for a man, I think; but most probably they will not let me have too much of that.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane at this moment has gone out to saunter a little in the noon sunshine and shade: she professes to be &#x201C;wonderfully strong,&#x201D; &#x201C;slept <hi rend="italic">well</hi>,&#x201D; &#x26;c; and indeed really takes with her quarters hitherto.</p>
 <p>Charles Buller is here; a very cheerful man to have beside one. The Lady&#x2019;s Mother (the widow Lady Sandwich) is the only woman visitor except Jane. Lady Sandwich used to live always in Paris, till she was driven hence by the late Revolutions: a brisk talking, friendly and rather entertaining character,&#x2014;has been very beautiful at one time; she has no other daughter left but this, and no Son but one:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Anne Julia Louisa Harriet, b.

For <pb id="pg-23-104" n="23:104"/>the present too we have a store of other Lords (Lansdown, Auckland, Granville, whom Jack knows about),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Granville George Leveson-Gower (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">91</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16543"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460410-TC-JWC-01"><sic>20:165</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1846-04-10">10 April 1846</date></corr></ref>), 2d Earl Granville, vice pres. of the board of trade.</note> with one or two official commoners: but these, I am happy to say, are to go <hi rend="italic">tomorrow;</hi> and we shall look for somewhat perceptibly quieter times, I hope,&#x2014;till more come! Alas, as Stephenson the Engineer said,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Stephenson (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">1848</date>), English inventor, and developer of railways, had died <date when="1848-08-12">12 Aug.</date></note> and I often say,&#x2014;if it were not for the <hi rend="italic">clothes</hi>, there would be little difference!&#x2014; We breakfast at half past nine; dine at half past seven: these, I imagine, will have to be my only two repasts while here. To say truth, I wish we were well home again, after all. And yet I suppose it is useful to come abroad into such foreign circles now and then: persons so very kind to us are not lightly to be refused.</p>
<p>The harvest has been dreadfully smashed here, and a great deal of it is still out, much still uncut: the wheat, standing in little stooks of three sheaves without hood, looks brown as steeped lint; some barley fields you could hardly notice to be anything but <hi rend="italic">clover</hi> (the heads all <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> and bent down), and one <hi rend="italic">mown</hi> field of barley we had a dispute about, whether it was mown barley or mown <hi rend="italic">stubble</hi>, till Lord A. yesterday dismounted, examined, and settled the question in the affirmative of barley! There will be an immense loss of crops here: the potatoes reckoned mostly to be gone, and the harvest weather the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> anybody remembers.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I am clattering at a great rate: but you perceive the only thing I mean is, that we are well here,&#x2014;and that we want to hear from you at Scotsbrig. Ask the Doctor to take pen in hand immediately. Let him tell me (if he can still!) that you and the rest are pretty well; we will let him off for that; but we want to hear all manner of other news about you,&#x2014;how the harvest, and Jamie&#x2019;s especially, gets on, what every one of you is doing; and specially what Jack&#x2019;s own news are,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle reported, <date when="1848-09-07">7 Sept.</date>, that the Austins had taken on an extra farm and that Mary &#x201C;still had some slight traces of her old complaint &#x2026; not in any severe form.&#x201D; Four-fifths of Stewart&#x2019;s potatoes were rotten but Jamie&#x2019;s still sound and had begun to be harvested: &#x201C;the wet weather &#x26; winds have lodged and made them ripen very unevenly, otherwise he would have had a much better crop than any he has ever had.&#x201D; Jamie was &#x201C;getting into better health.&#x201D; At Gillenbie &#x201C;Mrs. Stewart looks thin &#x26; worn,&#x201D; and Stewart said that Satur and Cushat hill were for sale to pay the creditors of Reid, Irving &#x26; Co.</note>&#x2014;and that he has <hi rend="italic">resumed</hi> his efforts for the poor Ecclefechan Station, and decided not to despair.&#x2014; You will get the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, I think, <hi rend="italic">tomorrow;</hi> that is, the day after you get this.</p>

I have read the two pieces with great pleasure, in which Mrs. C. your old acquaintance also shares. We find the Narrative full of rough veracity, clear, wholesome description of what you meant it to describe, namely&#x2014;of an authentic phasis of human life&#x2014;in which accordingly all human creatures may take a real interest. Withal there is a certain breezy freshness in the delineation, as indeed in former delineations by the same hand&#x2014;a rustic honesty, a healthy manful turn of mind is nowhere wanting, and that is a pleasant neighbour everywhere, and to all readers and all men. On the whole, if you continue this work in the way you have begun, I think there is every reason to expect a lasting favour for it and all manner of good fruit that you and your friends could have anticipated. There are only two precepts I will bid you once more always keep in mind&#x2014;the first is to be brief, not to dwell on an object one instant after you have made it clear to the reader, and on the whole to be select in your objects taken for description, dwelling on each in proportion to its likelihood to interest, omitting many in which such likelihood is doubtful, and only bringing out the more important into prominence and detail. The second, which indeed is still more essential, but which I need not insist upon since I see you scrupulously observe it, is to be exact to the truth in all points; never to hope to mend a fact by polishing any corner of it off into fiction, or adding any ornament which it had not, but to give it us always as God gave it&#x2014;that, I suppose, will turn out to be the best state it could be in! These two principles, I think, are the whole law of the matter; and in fact they are the epitome of what a sound, strong and healthy mind will, by nature, be led to achieve in such an enterprise; wherefore perhaps my best &#x201C;precept&#x201D; of all were to recommend Samuel Bamford to his own good genius (to his own honest good sense and healthy instincts) and bid him write or omit without misgivings whenever that had clearly spoken! And on the whole, persevere and prosper: that is the wish we form for you. We are here among high people, <pb id="pg-23-106" n="23:106"/>to whom the &#x201C;Passages&#x201D; and other writings of yours are known:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When <hi rend="italic">Passages</hi> first appeared, James Scarlett (<date when="1769">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844">1844</date>), Lord Abinger, who had first prosecuted Bamford at York, <date when="1819">1819</date>, for his part in Peterloo, was impressed with the work and obtained orders for it from govt. ministers and friends, including the present Lord Ashburton and his father; see also <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430413-TC-SBA-01"><sic>16:120&#x2013;21</sic><corr>TC to SBA, <date when="1843-04-13">13 April 1843</date></corr></ref>. Milnes also ordered a copy. As well as his merits as a writer, Bamford attracted their interest as a spokesman for the workingman, a moderate radical, now much opposed to violence, who exposed his fellow radical leaders of the earlier period.</note> last night I was commissioned by Lord Lansdowne to ask you to send him a copy of this new work,&#x2014;or to bid Simpkin and Marshall send it, if that can be done;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Publishers of <hi rend="italic">Early Days.</hi></note> but in any way to be sure that he gets it soon. I think perhaps you had better send it direct yourself; if the two Nos. are stitched together they will go thro&#x2019; the post-office for sixpence (six stamps stuck on them); the address is, The Lord Marquis of Lansdowne, Lansdowne House, London;&#x2014;and you have only to write a little note (a separate post-office note) saying, with your address given, that the book is sent by my order, that you yourself both write and sell it, and that the price is so and so. Pray do not neglect this, however, but set about doing it straightway. If you write at any time to Chelsea, the letter finds me after one day&#x2019;s delay. My wife bids me remember her to you and Mrs. Bamford, whom she hopes to see again by and by; Blakely appears to be a place very bright in her recollections.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jemima, b.

<p>Thanks for your long good Letter, which we read here with great satisfaction.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1848-09-07">7 Sept.</date></note> Letters arrive in the morning, by a rider from Alresford, before we are up; they go in the evening;&#x2014;and in general it seems the rule that for every kind of place (South as well as North) we are a day later than London.

O take care of her; take her out and give her a drive when the weather favours,&#x2014;that always used to do her good;&#x2014;at any rate, a <pb id="pg-23-107" n="23:107"/>little walk to the Fairy Brae, up the Moor, or as far as she will go, this you can always manage when it is not absolutely raining.&#x2014; Jamie seems to have begun his harvest the very day we came hither; we hope he is getting fast on, tho&#x2019; if your weather is like ours there must be many interruptions. Our bright Southwest weather, gave place to <hi rend="italic">broken grey</hi> some days ago, ushering itself in with thunder; and last night there came on a heavy tempest of wet and wind, which has ended for the present in a cold brisk wind from the North with the clearest sunshine: excellent so long as it will last. Even here the harvest does not seem by any means finished: I noticed on Saturday various fields uncarried; one large field of oats, all raked into <hi rend="italic">coils</hi>, as the fashion is here, and the people busy at it with their waggons, but hardly seeming to work so fiercely as I have seen in Scotland on occasion. A man told us certainly an &#x201C;eight part&#x201D; of the average crop was wanting this year.</p>
<p>As for our own life in this grand mansion, it is one of <hi rend="italic">total idleness</hi>, and has in it scarcely anything one can call an event for a penny letter. It is a sumptuous elaborate <hi rend="italic">representation</hi>, which has to be transacted, seemingly, for its own sake; no result attained by it, or hardly any, except the representation itself. To one like me it would be frightful to live on such terms! But happily that is not my lot; and for a few days it may answer well enough.</p>
 <p>We rise about 8; a valet, who waits here, is charged not to disturb me unless I call till half past eight; but he comes whenever I ring, and that is almost always before the ultimate limit of time. Shaving, dressing, bathing, all deliberately done, last three quarters of an hour. I have an excellent high and dry room, <hi rend="italic">two</hi> rooms if I needed; with three windows looking out into the woods and lawns, which are very pretty with their big <hi rend="italic">sough</hi> and the sun shining on them from the right (for I look towards the North); a huge old-fashioned bed with <hi rend="italic">curtains</hi> (which latter is a rare blessing), and a degree of <hi rend="italic">quietness</hi> which cannot be surpassed. Were it not the unwholesome diet, which I try to mend and manage, one might sleep to perfection here! Sleep, in fact, is one&#x2019;s best employment at present; and I often do a snatch of it, even in the day time.&#x2014; Before nine, as I said, we are out, most of us, I eastward, into a big portico that looks over lake and hillside towards the rising sun,&#x2014;where among the bushes I have a <hi rend="italic">pipe</hi> lodged, which I light and smoke, sauntering up and down, joined by Jane if she can manage it, much to my satisfaction. Jane lodges some doors from me, also in two pretty rooms which look out under this same portico; unless the weather is bad, she generally joins me on smoking occasions. Breakfast is at half-past nine; where are infinite flunkies, cates, condiments, very superfluous to me, with much &#x201C;making of wits&#x201D; (as B&#xF6;lte calls it), and not always a very great allowance of grave reason. That ends in about an hour. From that till <pb id="pg-23-108" n="23:108"/>2 o&#x2019;clock I continue trying (rather faintly) to keep private in my own room; but do not always succeed. To go down into the drawing-room is to get into the general whirl, and renounce even the hope of reading to any purpose. At 2 is luncheon, my share of it a glass of water; and gradually after that, all go for &#x201C;exercise&#x201D;; the women generally to drive, the men to ride,&#x2014;for which end there are, within the Park and without, innumerable conveniences,&#x2014;roads, cross-roads, &#x201C;green alleys&#x201D; and gravel ones, woods, downs, &#x26;c &#x26;c too tedious to mention! Last Saturday I had the pleasantest ride of all, being left entirely <hi rend="italic">to myself</hi>, so I went and explored the country round Alresford, and the pleasant village itself (about the the size of Lockerby, but much cleaner and prettier); I looked into many little cottages, with their scoured floors and trim dressers; all looked bright both in town and field in the beautiful autumn afternoon,&#x2014;and the mind of man went wandering on all manner of thoughts. Another day I went with Lord A. to a Justice meeting (Petty Sessions, I believe they call it); saw all the Publicans get their &#x201C;licences&#x201D; (really a good looking class of rustic citizens, many of them in leather leggins and white smocks), saw lastly a &#x201C;case of bastardy&#x201D; tried, old father, young daughter with <hi rend="italic">superfluous</hi> infant, and putativ<supplied>[e]</supplied> author of d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, who did not deny, but merely pleaded utter poverty,&#x2014;a really tragical and miserable scene, all the parties looked so miserable! Another day we rode, certain of us, to the scene of Cheriton Battle, or Alresford Battle, a once famed Fight, between Waller and Hopton in <date when="1644">1644</date>,&#x2014;of small importance now.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At which the parliamentary gen.

Of our Company I need not say much; it comes and goes, and does not often leave much trace behind it. Lady Sandwich (Lady H&#x2019;s Mother) is a most cheery old Dame, full of <hi rend="italic">private history</hi> if you set her going; there is also a young Lady, a Miss Ferrer (or Mitford,&#x2014;Greek Historian&#x2019;s grand-daughter, if I rightly understand),<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Annie Louisa Farrer (b. ca. <date when="1828">1828</date>), youngest child of Farrer Grove Spurgeon Farrer (<date when="1783">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826">1826</date>) and Mary Anstruther (d. <date when="1860">1860</date>), m., <date when="1809">1809</date>. Her first husband was Henry (<date when="1769">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803">1803</date>), son of the historian William Mitford (<date when="1744">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827">1827</date>).</note> who has been much in Paris, and &#x201C;has converted five Baptists&#x201D; (to the &#x201C;nominal&#x201D; Church, at which feats there has been much laughing lately); a rather pretty, rather reasonable, and most <pb id="pg-23-109" n="23:109"/>cheerful and agreeable young soul: she has gone to Town today (to attend a dinner,&#x2014;only 60 miles!) and does not return till Wednesday. It is said &#x201C;the Greys&#x201D; are coming, I know not exactly when, then &#x201C;the Taylors&#x201D; are coming,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord and Lady Grey; Henry and Theodosia Taylor.</note> or the Taylor and Helps to meet him, &#x26;c &#x26;c <foreign><hi rend="italic">nichts zu bedeuten</hi></foreign> [it does not matter]: and so we will at last leave all that. Jane continues pretty well in health, decidedly better than when in London; is a little ill off for <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> sometimes, being unwilling to light the fire in her room. I think she wrote to you one day, but I do not yet hear of any answer.&#x2014; &#x201C;Helen,&#x201D; old Kirkcaldy Helen Mitchell writes yesterday or Saturday, to say that her &#x201C;shop&#x201D; &#x26;c at Kirkcaldy is all in failure,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also TC&#x2019;s note, <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461229-JWC-SS-01"><sic>21:125</sic><corr>JWC to SS, <date when="1846-12-29">29 Dec. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> and that she is just coming to London again to seek a place! Jane is strongly tempted to take her back again; and indeed I suppose will end by doing that. The poor unfortunate little tick of an Helen has gone thro&#x2019; her fine-Ladyism at Dublin, her &#x201C;shop&#x201D; at home in Fife, and ends after a long circuit where she began! Better so than worse.</p>
<p>I shall be very anxious to hear what Hope Johnstone has made out in regard to the Station.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We have no kind of news in this still and altogether idle region; but I will send you a word merely to keep your anxieties at rest, and assure you that nothing is wrong with us hitherto. In fact I think we rather improve in health; especially Jane, who seems fully fresher, and more able for walking or the like, than is usual with her at Chelsea. This good result, I suppose, must be ascribed to the air, which is indeed pure and excellent, with hardly any rain, but of late days with a perceptible <hi rend="italic">frost</hi> on the contrary, which is decidedly too cold when the sun gets under a cloud. Except this salutary influence of &#x201C;the air,&#x201D; and the silence of green woods and downs and expanses, I know not any other favourable element; for our life here is totally without wise employment, distinguished rather by &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wit</hi>&#x201D; than by wisdom in our very talk; and the chief meal of the day is still between 7 and 8 at night. I myself begin to grow weary of such an existence; yet I do tolerably well when left quite alone (as is my case today), Cha<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Buller and the Lord A having set off to some Poor-Law Union or other,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A union of local administration for poor relief formed by uniting two or more parishes under a governing body.</note> at an hour that did not suit me; and so left me to do as I like till evening. The women sit talking in the drawing room, with &#x201C;seams&#x201D; of <hi rend="italic">make-believe</hi> sewing, or <hi rend="italic">daunder</hi> out and in on short walks, go driving, &#x26;c &#x26;c, while I, with a Book, or with none as I like, sit in sunny places among the bushes, or go walking in the most solitary green avenues, no company visible at all but a few <hi rend="italic">squirrels</hi> who are very brisk and pretty and care little about me: on these occasions one&#x2019;s own thoughts are one&#x2019;s employment,&#x2014;and Heaven knows I need not want for occupation in that quarter! Strange memories, out of old years and distant regions, rise on me, sad and beautiful, in these solitudes; and if sadness be present with one on these occasions, beyond doubt it is good for one to be <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> on occasion. I never fly from &#x201C;sadness&#x201D; altogether, for sadness has a kind of message to us withal; and he that would be wise <pb id="pg-23-111" n="23:111"/>will listen to that. A kind of artificial <hi rend="italic">solitude</hi> one does enjoy here; and really that perhaps is the chief benefit of such a sojourn to me.</p>
<p>We have had Lord Grey and his Wife,&#x2014;very small deer,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> 3.4. Lord Grey was sec. for colonies.</note> to be governing a Nation, I think! Others are coming, new visitors I believe <hi rend="italic">today;</hi> but they concern me little; <hi rend="italic">they</hi> do thee neither ill nor good! Charles Buller, when I get him alone, is worth talking to, but in company he goes wholly upon &#x201C;wit,&#x201D; and merely makes one laugh; Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> himself is decidedly a rather serious and clever-man; but he is <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> into this imbroglio of vanities, and will not, I fear, amount to much either. Heigho!</p>
<p>I send you two of the Letters I have got, for a moment&#x2019;s entertainment: &#x201C;Theodore&#x201D; is of the Sect of &#x201C;White Quakers,&#x201D; whom perhaps the Doctor can explain to you: I have answered both Letters, and so want no more to do with them.</p>
<p>Jane had a Letter from the Doctor the next day after my Letter to him went. Thank Heaven he still reports well of you all, especially of you dear Mother! I have no doubt his presence with you is a real enlivenment, apart from the medical advice he gives. He was to go to Moffat, but only for a day;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, [<date when="1848-09-17">17 Sept.</date>], that he had been to Moffat, where he &#x201C;saw one of [JWC&#x2019;s] aunts there&#x2014;the &#x2018;goodnatured&#x2019; youngest but one who is not clever but well liked by all her friends.&#x201D; She was also visiting the Hunters and &#x201C;now wholly occupied with Free Kirk, Sunday Schools &#x26;c. as so many fixed ideas.&#x201D;</note> we hope he is now back again, and taking care of his Mother among other things.</p>
<p>I shall be anxious to hear when anything falls out concerning &#x201C;the Station,&#x201C;&#x2014;for instance, when Hope Johnstone&#x2019;s opinion becomes known.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had said, <date when="1848-09-07">7 Sept.</date>, that Hope Johnstone and two other directors had been at Ecclefechan &#x201C;to see what could be done in regard to the station,&#x201D; but reported, <date when="1848-09-18">18 Sept.</date>, &#x201C;no further news. &#x2026; The Caledonian Comp<hi rend="italic">y</hi> are at present desperately poor, their &#xa3;50 shares selling for &#xa3;19, &#x26; no prospect of any dividend, no disposition to incur any avoidable expense.&#x201D;</note> But indeed I want still more to hear about Scotsbrig again, and anything concerning that and you will be sure enough to interest me.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane comes running up to say that &#x201C;Luncheon waits,&#x201C;&#x2014;where I indeed take nothing save a glass of water, but seem to be partly expected to shew face too. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> then, dear good Mother; God bless you one and all! I will write soon again, even if I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> hear, which however I hope.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Scott,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about those poor pioneers of the new era who are now at task-work on the Sologne. I will transmit your information to the quarter where it is due; and when you receive any more it will be welcome to me for the same distinction. Mr Spedding, my Cumberland Correspondent, is deeply interested in that experiment; being anxious, along with me, to see some similar thing tried among ourselves,&#x2014;that we too might begin endeavouring to &#x201C;organise labour&#x201D; at the point where it has so palpably fallen disorganic, and by the method of command and obedience, the only method that was ever yet found adequate for any &#x201C;organisation&#x201D; whatsoever in this poor world of ours!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott replied, <date when="1848-09-14">14 Sept.</date>, from Woolwich to TC&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1848-08-05">5 Aug.</date>, that he had inquired of Lady Elgin (Elizabeth, dowager countess of Elgin and Kincardine) in Paris, who in turn had made inquiries of her own and who &#x201C;sends the result, which is meagre enough&#x201C;: <foreign>viz.</foreign>, that the number of workmen in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> report was much exaggerated, that they are under military discipline, that their pay is as described but the govt.&#x2019;s deduction for food left them only eight or ten sous, and that the whole enterprise could only be considered as an experiment.</note> Pray do not neglect to send me word, whenever you get any farther light on the matter.</p>
<p>I am rejoiced to hear that you have some views towards settlement as a Permanent Teacher among us, on terms so fair as the University College is likely to offer. That will do excellently well, that Professorship, under which all manner of good didactic operations might be more or less included,&#x2014;if you were once fairly in it. What is to be done to help you? Whatsoever lies in me you have at your command. The Electors, I fear, will hardly any of them be personally known to me; but try; if any of them is, I will personally solicit. At any rate I can write you a testimonial: that I will certainly do whenever you bid me. You have only to say when:&#x2014;or perhaps it is as soon as I like, before the <date when="1848-10-10">10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of October</date>?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480921-TC-CUCL-01">TC to CUCL, <date when="1848-09-21">21 Sept.</date></ref> Scott was to be appointed to the chair of English lang. and lit., Univ. College, London.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; We are here, in a very idle flurried condition (but capable of writing a Testimonial) for probably a week or ten days more: if before that term will do better than after, write a line to say so. But I partly hope to see you at Chelsea before the election time. I pilgrimed one day to Chester Place, a while ago, and found the bird flown.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Scott himself or possibly Mary Rich, visiting her half-sister Fanny Wedgwood, 42 Chester Terr., Regent&#x2019;s Pk.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>Here, selected from certain others worth nothing, is a kind of answer to your inquiry concerning the French Task-workers on the Sologne; the best answer I have yet got, which unfortunately is not worth much.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See preceding letter.</note> Indeed the Enterprise seems much smaller than the Newspapers represented it; and in spite of the &#x201C;impermeable blankets,&#x201D; I doubt it will gradually die away, and leave not even an effective reminiscence of itself. If more news come to me on the subject, you shall have them. I find hitherto scarcely any human soul that will admit the possibility of thus dealing with Pauperism; and no official soul that does not shriek with horror at the bare mention of it. Alas, alas, the light giggling humour of almost all official and other men, in these days, makes me for one very serious! I believe that the righteous gods will make us all serious by and by.</p>
<p>For the last fortnight we are here, my Wife and I, in the midst of a sufficiently brilliant and totally <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> circle of Society,&#x2014;such as, I think, if you should describe it to an intelligent Inhabitant of the Moon, the Moonite would positively deny the possibility of. O Heavens, to think of the wild waste, madder than that of boiling potatoes by fires of cinnamon, that prevails in this distracted Earth! But I will hold my peace; in a little while I hope to be back at Chelsea again, secure in my own garret, and at <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi> to sit entirely silent over the unspeakable! God mend us all: we do all need it; at least I, for one, very much do.</p>
<p>My regards to the champion of Bacon;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Spedding.</note> tho&#x2019; Bacon have lain among the pots, may pious Insight (if indeed Insight can) bring him forth as a moulted dove, with his wings of silver and his neck of the yellow gold!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 68:13.</note> O Heavens, it is surely pious to do so, and the first function of an understanding artist with the pen,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">if</hi>, I say, such be the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>, but not otherwise!</p>
<p>Laurence, before I left Town, did a new tremendous Sketch of me; for I <pb id="pg-23-114" n="23:114"/>was and am the idlest of all sons of Adam, ready to be painted,&#x2014;almost to be made into sausages, if anybody could find use for me! To myself I am of none or less.&#x2014; On the whole it is better that I glide out over these green sunny spaces, under the shade of a whispering ilex, and there smoke, in absolute silence, whatever my thoughts may be. Even to you I will speak no more at this time. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Spedding; good be with you and those dear to you, always&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We received your two Letters,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1848-09-17">17</date> and <date when="1848-09-18">18 Sept.</date></note> the second this morning; and need not say that they were right welcome to us. Your news is wholly good, and your way of sending it good; one wishes for many more such Letters.</p>
<p>That was an excellent thing that of taking our Mother over to Cressfield;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1848-09-17">17 Sept.</date>, that he had taken his mother over to see the &#x201C;Miss Littles of Cressfield,&#x201D; where she had not been for many years: &#x201C;They are worthy, kind people &#x26; do a great deal of good in Ecclefechan; so nobody robs their orchard or garden. &#x2026; Every newyear&#x2019;s day for a long while, they have had a &#x2018;sweet mild cheese&#x2019; for distribution &#x26; given a good slice of it, with corresponding bread, to every man woman &#x26; child that chose to come for it.&#x201D; The Misses Little are not further identified, but see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220923-TC-MAC-01"><sic>2:163</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1822-09-23">23 Sept. 1822</date></corr></ref> for other Littles of Cressfield.</note> a thing that waited for you to do it,&#x2014;for I, tho&#x2019; I rejoice to know it done, could never myself have done it. Alas, I am always in such a state of gloom and misery when out on my travels,&#x2014; &#x2014;and when <hi rend="italic">in</hi> from them too, I am little better! There is something very interesting to me in the history of these poor Miss Littles; elderly maidens whom I can look back upon as rosy children of my own size. It is literally true that I have &#x201C;paidled in the burn&#x201D; with them:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burns, &#x201C;Auld Lang Syne&#x201D; st. 4.</note> such scenes are distinctly present in my memory at this moment. When you next call at Cressfield, offer my kind regards to the two good Ladies, and say it is impossible I can ever forget <hi rend="italic">them</hi> in this world, or cease to wish all that is good to them!&#x2014; I am glad also to hear of Hunter&#x2019;s visit: I hope you and he are managing to do poor Miss Grahame some benefit.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Dr. Jacob Hunter, who had visited John in London; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421019-JWC-JW-01"><sic>15:133</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-10-19">19 Oct. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450607-TC-JBO-01"><sic>19:74</sic><corr>TC to JBO, <date when="1845-06-07">7 June 1845</date></corr></ref>. John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1848-09-18">18 Sept.</date>, that &#x201C;Dr. Hunter was here from Moffat on thursday, in return for my visit. I took him to the top of Burnswark &#x26; made him see Miss Grahame,&#x201D; who was &#x201C;not at present seriously ill.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>At The Grange here our weather and all outward equipments continue <pb id="pg-23-115" n="23:115"/>good; but the <hi rend="italic">inner man</hi> (in one of our cases at least) begins to get decidedly a little weary of the affair! I hear nothing of its ending, however;&#x2014;for the people, as you may conjecture, <hi rend="italic">live</hi> by company; as poor people with 40 or 50 thousand a-year are obliged to do in this country: with <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, I suppose, the matter need not end for weeks and weeks yet. But on my own side,&#x2014;especially unless I get to sleep a little better,&#x2014;I believe it cannot hold out very long! Jane, who seems to like it, and does better with it than I, may continue after me till she has had enough.&#x2014; &#x2014; Our company is not worth talking about, since I wrote last: Buller, little Fleming (Mephisto in a wig, as I called him), a Lady Montague (who sings <hi rend="italic">well</hi>),<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Fleming and probably Lady Olivia Montagu (d. <date when="1922">1922</date>), da. of the 6th duke of Manchester.</note> Lady Sandwich (who abounds in cheerful gossip, and knows all manner of women and men), these with two &#x201C;young Ladies&#x201D; much interested in the Church &#x26;c and young gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to match;&#x2014;and for the current week, Henry Taylor and Aubrey de Vere, the two <hi rend="italic">greatest</hi> bores, especially the former, we have had at all yet. De Vere I could rather like if by himself; for he is a serious tho&#x2019; very soft, Puseyish<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like E. B. Pusey.</note> and theoretic young Irish gentleman; but Taylor and he, with their mutual admiration, much aggravate one another; and, in brief, my best resource is to keep considerably out of their way! &#x201C;Making of wits&#x201D; is, as you say, a wretched trade;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had written, <date when="1848-09-17">17 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;That &#x2018;making wits&#x2019; is a good deal worse than perfect idleness, but may perhaps be borne with impunity for a limited time, more especially when one is in a state of internal quarrel &#x26; regret &#x26; dissatisfaction from day to day with it.&#x201D;</note> and except the Lady A. herself and C.

<p><salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,&#x2014;</salute>Allow me to offer respectfully my sincere testimony in regard to Mr. A. J. Scott, at present a Candidate for your Professorship of English Literature.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott has long been intimately known to me as a man of great, solid, <pb id="pg-23-116" n="23:116"/>and original powers of mind,&#x2014;of eager persevering industry,&#x2014;of a pure, high, and earnest character; whose rare merits the whole world, if at length the fit arena were conceded to him, might yet well come to recognise. A man of strong judgment,&#x2014;of deep inquiring spirit, full of delicacy, and of energy, and of veracity; whose pilgrimage through the confusions, intellectual and other, of our time, has been that of a valiant, resolute, and modest man; a struggle (as I suppose) full of toil and painful effort and endurance, but rich also in noble victories, and of lasting result to him.</p>
<p>Of such a man, successfully experienced in the struggles of his age, the proper business seems that of &#x201C;Teaching&#x201D;; of training others to front them with success.</p>
<p>In Literature, English and Foreign, Modern and Ancient, I believe Mr. Scott to have made good studies, and to be capable beyond most of continuing and extending them; and I know that in all literature hitherto, as in all henceforth is likely to be the case with him, he has studied with a serious, manful, and noble aim; persevering instinctively towards the kernel and spiritual essence of the matter; leaving aside the pedantics, egoistic ambitions, and natural or accidental husks and adjuncts, as of no moment to him.</p>
 <p>He possesses singular gifts of utterance; what I should expect to prove a singular gift of Teaching by the mode of College Lecture: for, with an intellect fit to master the most confused subject, and extort from it what its vital elements are, where its secret lies, and what the true method of expanding and describing it is, he combines a felicity in extempore speaking; which are of themselves rare, and are much rarer in such a combination as the above. I should consider Mr. Scott an acquisition to any University; and, for discoursing to young Englishmen about what &#x201C;English Literature&#x201D; means, has meant, and may and should mean, peculiarly appropriate.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Among others writing for Scott were Frederick Denison Maurice (<date when="1805">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872">72</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18384"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>8:196</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1835-08-13">13 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>), Broad Church leader and Christian Socialist, prof. of English lit. and history, King&#x2019;s College, London; Hensleigh Wedgwood; Hare; Bunsen; Thomas Erskine; and John Carlyle, &#x201C;Editor and Translator of Dante&#x2019;s Inferno.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>I rather apprehend there must be some mistake in this matter of the Gardener, concerning which I first receive your Note this morning.</p>
<p>I never had any servant specifically doing duty as Gardener; nor for many years back have I had anything that could at all deserve the name of Garden to employ one upon. It occurs to me, after reflexion, that I did once about twenty years ago lay out a piece of new ground among the mountains in Dumfriesshire, and fashion it into a small garden, with lawns &#x26;c on a very humble scale to correspond; and that there worked for me, on that occasion, for perhaps six weeks or so, a man, by regular profession a Gardener, from Dumfries,&#x2014;whose figure and performance I remember very well, but whose name I either never knew or have now quite lost. Perhaps this was Andrew Leitch?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Otherwise unidentified.</note> If so, he is (or was) a trim man of middle size, with slightly aquiline countenance, much marked by small-pox; grey-eyed; with Anglified-Scotch manner; and must now be about fifty years of age. This man was one of the expertest workers with gardener&#x2019;s tools I ever saw; full of invention, promptitude, impetuosity; indeed, of extraordinary vigour and diligence, and skilful beyond common at whatever he put hand to, in gardening or otherwise;&#x2014;for the rest, a perfectly respectable man, so far as I knew; and fit, I should think, to be a most useful servant, had it not been (as I heard, and could partly observe) that his temper was apt to be a little hot and uncertain, and his humour capricious, so that he was said to be often changing his master, and not quite easy to command, in those years. In this latter respect, age may have done much to amend him; and I knew nothing else to his disadvantage, but all else as I describe it.</p>
<p>Possibly enough, however, this is not your man at all; possibly your man alludes to another &#x2018;T. Carlyle Esq,&#x2019; also of Dumfriesshire, with whom I am sometimes confounded; who is now, I think called &#x2018;Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> T. Carlyle,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carlyle (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855">55</date>; <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>), apostle of the Catholic Apostolic Church; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320218-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:132</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1832-02-18">18 Feb. 1832</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430705-JWC-TC-01"><sic>16:232</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-07-05">5 July 1843</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430707-TC-CKJB-01"><sic>237&#x2013;38</sic><corr>TC to CKJB, <date when="1843-07-07">7 July 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> and lives at Albury in Surrey for most part, joined in some kind of clerical function with H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Drummond Esq M.P. of that place.</p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We have been here above 3 weeks,&#x2014;three weeks past on Friday,&#x2014;and I should have written to you sooner: but the sad truth is, nobody can be worse situated for writing than I now am, tho&#x2019; one qualification, total idleness from all kinds of <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, never was or could be more perfectly vouchsafed me than here! But there is such an incessant frivolous whirl of what I call &#x201C;laborious Donothingism&#x201D; that one&#x2019;s whole day is spent <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of one&#x2019;s own command; and one arrives at evening after evening, often without having done the most necessary duties. Lord pity those whose existence is altogether bound to such a course. For me a week or two now and then is nearly too much for me; and may serve mainly, I think, to extinguish any envy I might have had of immense wealth and high rank, and to increase my respect for honest industry under what terms soever carried on.</p>
<p>These are the friends, as you guess, whom we used to visit in another part of this County: they have now come to their full titles and estates, the elder Lord Ashburton, lately proprietor of this place, having suddenly died last year.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1847-05">May</date>.</note> It is an immense and quite grand house this, about 3 times as big as Kinmont<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kinmont House, one of the homes of the marquess of Queensberry; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420423-TC-JWC-01"><sic>14:162</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-23">23 April 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> I think; in the middle of immense parks &#x26;c &#x26;c, with flunkies swarming in every corner: our party varies from day to day, and is of the grandest sort, but to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the most unproductive. The chief benefit I get, indeed, is from the excellent country air and bright weather, and many solitary musings I have in these green spaces,&#x2014;very sad for most part, but full of meaning to me; I do not think so many old things, old some of them as the beginnings of my life, have come into my head anywhere in a month these many years. When I retire out of the idle gabble, and sit down alone, under some tree or lone shelter, to smoke a peaceable pipe of <pb id="pg-23-119" n="23:119"/>&#x2019;bacco, my thoughts are manifold!&#x2014; At present we are of very small number, the poor Lady having fallen ill; in a week more (if I can manage to stay so long, but I have often been on the point of running off!) we are to be reduced still lower, and greater &#x201C;quietness&#x201D; is promised. We shall see.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jane keeps unusually well; and I too seem sometimes to be slowly gathering some new health, in spite of &#x201C;dinner at 7,&#x201D; and the other influences. That really is all the news I have got to send up to this date: That we are here, thinking of you, and tolerably well.&#x2014; Today that Note came from Scotsbrig; which I enclose, that you may see a little how they prosper there, if you are quite short of news. <closer><salute>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign> for this day. Lord Ash<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is &#x201C;waiting for me to ride&#x201C;: I must off, off! Newspaper <hi rend="italic">as usual</hi>, tell James.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
 <p>I take time by the forelock<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial and coterie speech.</note> this morning, and write you a word before any interruption turn up, of which thro&#x2019; the day we know not how many sorts will occur. This table of mine is far too low, and makes me ill, sleepy, and <hi rend="italic">stupid</hi> beyond measure, when I sit long at it,&#x2014;I write here in my own bedroom; a spacious apartment, but getting slightly too cold now without a fire; the drawing-rooms have ample writing-apparatus, but also are continually liable to noise:&#x2014;at this low table let me jot you down a word, under such circumstances as there are. Today we have a most quiet house; our company <hi rend="italic">all</hi> gone, except Lady Sandwich, a fine cheery old dame, who never makes her appearance till past noon; the rest, I say, are all gone their several ways, a young Miss Ferrar towards Ryde<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the Isle of Wight.</note> just half an hour ago; and here we are, Jane and I alone <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> in this huge establishment, which at this moment is as silent as a Hall of the Past. It will not be long so, I suppose.

Last time the poor Lady caught a cold, had to wait a day in Town, came back almost alarmingly worse (being weak in the lungs)&#x2014;has had the Alresford Doctor attending her ever since; and has not shewn face to any of her guests, except within these two days to the women part of them, for she is now got nearly well again,&#x2014;not ready, I hope, for <hi rend="italic">another</hi> expedition to Locock! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign> It is a sad chimera of an existence, this that many of us with such effort lead!&#x2014; There is still no word of our getting home; Jane seems to enjoy her quarters, and I too have got into a little better sleep, and consent to doze along a while longer here. My health even seems to be improving in the main: &#x201C;the air,&#x201D; I suppose, must be equal to the best, and the calm green world one lives in whenever out of doors, the profound <hi rend="italic">solitude</hi> (such to me it virtually is,&#x2014;lonely as la Trappe),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Founding place of the Trappist monks; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330907-TC-JWC-01"><sic>6:432</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1833-09-07">7 Sept. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> the daily or almost daily ride, &#x26;c: these things seem to act favourably in spite of the unwholesome hours and diet. I find it good also to restrict myself to about two glasses of wine; or occasionally none at all, which seems to be still better.&#x2014; The &#x201C;Hampshire Yeomanry&#x201D; are about assembling in Winchester this next Friday and for a week or 10 days after: a Troop of them mustered here one day last week, and went flourishing, cantering, and popping off carbines all day,&#x2014;dining at night sumptuously in the Captain&#x2019;s (L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A&#x2019;s) lower premises here.

<salute>Dear Ballantyne,</salute>
<p>I know not what little tiff this is that has arisen between Espinasse and you; but I wish much it would handsomely blow over, and leave all of you soon in the simple state of as you were! Reflecting in the enclosed little Note which reached me this morning, I decide that one of the usefullest things I could in the first place attempt in regard to it, would be to try if haply the matter could not be quashed, and people who are certainly good friends, and who are probably of real service to one another, be prevented from flying asunder on slight cause.</p>
<p>This controversy I know well enough to be perpetual and universal between Editor and contributor;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ballantyne was ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Examiner</hi>, to which Espinasse contributed.</note> no law can settle it; the best wisdom can do no better than suppress it from time to time. On Espinasse&#x2019;s side I will counsel patience, everywhere needful in human affairs; on your side, I would say, that tho&#x2019; an Editor can never wholly abandon his right to superintend, which will mean an occasional right to alter, or at least to remonstrate and propose alterations, yet it is in general wise, when as in this case you have got a really consciencious, accurate and painstaking contributor, to be sparing in the exercise of the right, and to put up with various unessential things, rather than <hi rend="italic">forcibly</hi> break in to amend them. You have perhaps but a faint idea how much it distresses and disheartens such a man as I describe; nay <hi rend="italic">lames</hi> him in the practice of his art, and tends to put his &#x201C;conscience&#x201D; especially into painful abeyance: &#x201C;what is the use of <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>&#x201D; his Literary conscience says: &#x201C;better for us all that I went to sleep!&#x201D; <pb id="pg-23-122" n="23:122"/>When a man <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a literary conscience,&#x2014;which I do believe is a very rare case,&#x2014;this result is a most sad one to bring about; hurtful not to him only, as you may well perceive. In fact I think a serious sincere man <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> very well write if he have the perpetual fear of correction before his eyes; and if I were the master of such a one, I should certainly endeavour to leave him (within very wide limits) his own director, and to let him feel that he was so, and responsible accordingly.</p>
<p>Forgive me if I interfere unduly with your affairs. If the case be that you perceive, after due trial, that Espinasse is no longer worth his wages to the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, then all is said, and I have not a word to object. But if it be not so, and this is but a transitory embarrassment of detail, then it will be a service to both parties if I can get it ended within the safe limits.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It apparently so ended. In his <hi rend="italic">Recollections</hi> Espinasse described Ballantyne as &#x201C;then one of the cheeriest, hopefullest, and what is more, kindliest of men,&#x2014;when a Scotchman is kindly he is very kindly,&#x2014;and, however depressed his circumstances became, he was always eager to help any one as unfortunate as himself. He was argumentative and positive to a degree&#x201D; (241).</note> Of the fact, how it may stand, I know nothing at all, and you alone can know.</p>
<p>All help that I can give Espinasse in other courses of enterprise I have of course to promise him; but I will advise him first of all that a reconciliation with you, if any ground he feels feasible were offered, would seem to me by far the desirablest course. <closer><salute>With kind regards to Ireland, to whom indeed as much as to you these remarks address themselves<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Ireland, who was publisher and business manager of the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Examiner</hi>.</note>&#x2014;in great haste&#x2014; Yours always truly</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>We have been here, with country friends, near a month, and are not to be in Chelsea, I imagine, for some ten days yet.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>The question that perplexes you is one that no man can answer; you may console yourself by reflecting that it is by its nature <hi rend="italic">insoluble</hi> to human creatures,&#x2014;that perhaps what human creatures mainly have to do with such a question is to get it well put to rest, suppressed if not answered, that so their Life and its duties may be attended to without impediment from it. Such questions in this our earthly existence are many.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-23-123" n="23:123"/>&#x201C;There are two things,&#x201D; says the German Philosopher, &#x201C;that strike me dumb: the Starry Firmament (<hi rend="italic">palpably</hi> infinite) and the Sense of Right and Wrong in man.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Immanuel Kant, Conclusion to the <hi rend="italic">Critique of Practical Reason</hi> (<date when="1788">1788</date>); cf. <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461216-TC-LHB-01"><sic>21:109</sic><corr>TC to LHB, <date when="1846-12-16">16 Dec. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> Whoever follows out that &#x201C;dumb&#x201D; thought will come upon the origin of our conceptions of Heaven and Hell,&#x2014;of an Infinitude of merited Happiness, and an Infinitude of merited Woe,&#x2014;and have much to reflect upon under an aspect considerably changed.</p>
<p>Consequences good and evil, blessed and accursed, it is very clear, do follow from all our actions here below, and prolong and propagate and spread themselves into the Infinite, or beyond our calculation or conception; but whether the notion of <hi rend="italic">reward</hi> and <hi rend="italic">penalty</hi> be not, on the whole, rather a <hi rend="italic">human</hi> one transferred to that immense divine fact, has been doubtful to many. Add this consideration, which the best Philosophy teaches us: That the very <hi rend="italic">consequences</hi> (not to speak of the penalties at all) of <hi rend="italic">evil</hi> actions die away, and become abolished, long before Eternity ends; that it is only the consequences of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> actions that are <hi rend="italic">eternal</hi>,&#x2014;for these are in harmony with the laws of this universe, and add themselves to it, and cooperate with it for ever, while all that is in <hi rend="italic">disharmony</hi> with it must necessarily be without continuance, and soon fall dead:&#x2014;as perhaps you have heard in the sound of a distant chorus of voices, in the sound of a Scottish Psalm amid the mountains; the true notes alone <hi rend="italic">support</hi> one another, all following the one true rule; the false notes, each following its own diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> false rule, quickly destroy one another; and the Psalm, which was discordant enough near at hand, is a perfect melody when heard from afar.</p>
<p>On the whole I must account it but a morbid weak imagination that shudders over this wondrous divine universe as a place of Despair to any creature; and contrariwise, a most degraded human sense, sunk down to the region of the <hi rend="italic">brutal</hi> (however common it be) that in any case remains blind to the <hi rend="italic">infinite</hi> difference there ever is between Right and Wrong for a human creature,&#x2014;or God&#x2019;s Law and the Devil&#x2019;s Law.&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours very truly</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dearest Babbie&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I remember I was called away before my last letter to you had reached its natural termination; or I should have told you <hi rend="italic">my</hi> news of Helen (Mitchell) which are much more precise than yours. The week after I came <pb id="pg-23-124" n="23:124"/>here I received a letter from her <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Chelsea, to state that her &#x201C;small shop&#x201D; was <hi rend="italic">no go</hi>,&#x2014;that her Sister<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Black, m. to Andrew, a joiner; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380826-TC-JWC-01"><sic>10:155&#x2013;56</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1838-08-26">26 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> had taken &#x201C;the whole contents&#x201D; off her hands,&#x2014;that she &#x201C;would prefer being in service again to anything else on earth,&#x201C;&#x2014;that she was about to start for London on a visit to one <hi rend="italic">Sarah</hi>&#x2014;(formerly &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">No 21</hi>,&#x201D; since married) hoping to find a place, and if I knew of any for her she would be glad&#x2014; The letter looked to me a <hi rend="italic">feeler</hi> put out to ascertain if I would put away Anne and take <hi rend="italic">her</hi> back&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> I would not have done&#x2014;Anne having grown to suit me better than Helen did with her little wild temper, and ups and downs, and latent tendency to spirituous liquors&#x2014;but Anne being to go at any rate, and my outlook into the future still blank enough, the question was should I risk the Old Helen with her great faults and great virtues&#x2014;two years older, and too probably spoiled as well as rusted by two years idleness and self-dependence Knowing my cowardly feeling about strangers you need hardly be told how I decided&#x2014;I wrote to her that I had misgivings about taking her back&#x2014;but nevertheless <hi rend="italic">there</hi> was her old place vacant, and she might take it if she liked&#x2014;and of course she liked&#x2014;tho her letter indicated already a strong jealousy of Anne! So she would not go to London she said until I fixed when I should want her&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">that</hi> I cannot tell till I get home again and have questioned Anne. <hi rend="small-caps">she</hi> studied my convenience about going so I must in return study <hi rend="italic">hers</hi> rather than Helen&#x2019;s&#x2014; Meanwhile I wrote to Helen that Miss Welsh was at Auchtertoul and I wished she (Helen M) would walk over and see her&#x2014;she will hardly have the courage I fancy. So tell our Helen not to miss an opportunity of calling at M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Black&#x2019;s and seeing as much into the real state of the case as possible&#x2014;it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have been a dram-shop after all&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Black may have bought the remaining whisky&#x2014;to drink it&#x2014;the shop being discontinued before they inquired, they cannot tell what it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, till they know what it was&#x2014; I am glad and afraid at the same time. My hand is out in the managing of a wild servant&#x2014;and I do not know whether I shall get the mastery over her again&#x2014;and if I dont&#x2014;we shall have to part &#x201C;<hi rend="italic"><foreign>avec</foreign> explosion</hi>&#x201D; as the French Dramas have it&#x2014; The Parlours are painted and papered I understand&#x2014;and it is to be hoped will not smell <hi rend="italic">too</hi> bad when we return&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">ten days</hi> I expect&#x2014; &#x201C;Alls well that ends well&#x201C;&#x2014; For this time nothing is settled or even strongly proposed about &#x201C;The intellectual <hi rend="italic">gate</hi>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently the farmhouse proposed for the Carlyles on the Ashburton estate.</note>&#x2014; Lord A finds so many unexpected drains on his fortune&#x2014;large as it is&#x2014;just at the first coming into possession that they are not indulging in any <hi rend="italic">fancies</hi> this year&#x2014;and other years it is to be hoped will bring their own <pb id="pg-23-125" n="23:125"/>requirements&#x2014;it is much more agreeable for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> that the project should sink away thus than that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should have put a veto on it or <hi rend="italic">he</hi> for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> consolation&#x2014; But anyhow he could never have been mad enough to dream of letting <hi rend="italic">that</hi> farm-house be fitted up for <hi rend="italic">him!</hi>&#x2014;as unless the Genii could have carried it a quarter of a mile from its offices and farm-yard&#x2014;sleep for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014;never to say for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;would be perfectly impossible there&#x2014;it is no <hi rend="italic">poetical</hi>-farm&#x2014;with the farming left out&#x2014;but the place where all the cocks and hens and geese and ducks and pigs and cows and horses and carts requisite for the maintenance of this immense household are kept&#x2014;and the noise is something too dreadful! I question if that which greeted the ears of Adam amidst the first Creation of Animals came up to it&#x2014; Lady A got a bad cold in going up to London last week to see her D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and could not return next day as she proposed, and only came the day after to go to bed; where she remained, at least in her bedroom, for several days&#x2014;even now she is only a few hours in the day in the Drawingroom&#x2014;does not dine with us&#x2014;but I play chess and talk with her in her private sitting-room&#x2014;which is the beautifulest room you can imagine and opening into a large conservatory with a glass door. Most of the Company were gone or going when she fell ill&#x2014;and there now only remains her Mother Lady Sandwich&#x2014;who is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> agreeable and a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> sort of woman to my notion tho her daughter can hardly endure her. <hi rend="small-caps">She</hi> goes on Saturday and Lady A proposes that next Monday she would take M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and me to <hi rend="italic">Freshwater</hi> in the Isle of Wight for a week while Lord Ashburton is <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> his Yeomanry in Winchester&#x2014; After that I rather expect we shall be <hi rend="italic">allowed</hi> to go home&#x2014;as she has a great houseful of people coming on the <date when="1848-10-16">16 of October</date> and will need a few days of <hi rend="italic">Alverstoke</hi> to put her up to them&#x2014; I have not been so well latterly as in the first week&#x2014;the sickness or more properly a sense of suffocation has given me many bad hours&#x2014;but it is wonderful how one gets used by long endurance to sufferings which in the first moments of them drive one beside oneself&#x2014; To see me here nobody I am sure would suspect that I am not quite healthy and content&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> know better&#x2014;but the less one meditates on ones own miseries the better</p>
<p>I have made two new acquaintances whom I mean to keep up in London&#x2014;a male and female acquaintance the female One has already reached its culmination&#x2014;and no more can come of it than has come&#x2014;pleasant superficial intercourse&#x2014;with the male one it is better&#x2014;that may develope itself into a real friendship&#x2014;the name is romantic enough Aubrey de Vere&#x2014; and the man who bears it romantic enough&#x2014;very handsome&#x2014;young, <hi rend="italic">religious</hi>&#x2014;to the extent even of eating fish on Fridays and fasting in Lent&#x2014; A Poet&#x2014;highly accomplished every way despising &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wits</hi>&#x201D; (wonderfulest of all) and <pb id="pg-23-126" n="23:126"/>in short a rare mortal as men go<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >De Vere had returned from Ireland in late summer and visited the Grange while the Carlyles were there, and he had evidently had a long talk with TC and JWC on Sun., <date when="1848-09-24">24 Sept.</date>, during a walk on the Down. He wrote to JWC, <date when="1848-09-30">30 Sept.</date>, of &#x201C;how much gratitude I felt for the unreserve with which you spoke on subjects which are too often shunned. You are neither of you among those who like conventional topics or serious topics as far as they can be played with: &#x26; I believe that you perceived that the interest I felt in our conversation was a deep human interest &#x2026; &#x26; not any impertinent curiousity. You spoke &#x2026; of the toleration with which I listened to opinions very different from those which I consider orthodox. &#x2026; When I hear Christianity denied after it has been in the world for eighteen centuries I am oppressed by a painful conviction that this denial proceeds, perhaps in a chief degree, from the faults of us who call ourselves Christians.&#x201D; He went on to a thirteen-page discussion of his own faith, ending: &#x201C;Pray forgive me for thus writing to you. I feel that it is an intrusion, &#x26; fear it may be an impertinent one; but I wished to be open with you as you &#x26; your husband were with me.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This is Friday, the day that corresponds to the No-post day of London; therefore I will write you a small word before the stop occur.</p>
<p>We are getting very quiet here now; indeed I fancy there are few as big houses with so few inhabitants in them as we now count.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The house was originally built by Inigo Jones (<date when="1573">1573</date>&#x2013;<date when="1652">1652</date>), and for a short time, ca. <date when="1795">1795</date>, it was occupied by the Prince of Wales, later George IV. The estate originally belonged to Winchester Abbey. It was inherited by Henry Drummond, then bought by the 1st Lord Ashburton, <date when="1817">1817</date>. Ca. <date when="1809">1809</date> it was altered by the architect William Wilkins (<date when="1778">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839">1839</date>). The front elevation was said to be &#x201C;highly striking: the Grand Portico, which is its principal feature, is of the Doric order of &#x2026; the Parthenon. &#x2026; The Terrace, recently raised, &#x2026; conceals the basement floor &#x2026; and the entablature conceals the attic windows; so that the House now appears to be two stories only in height&#x201D; (J. P. Neale, <hi rend="italic">Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen</hi>, 1st ser. [<date when="1819">1819</date>] vol. 2 [n.p.], under &#x201C;Hampshire&#x201D;).</note> All guests are gone except ourselves, and Lady Sandwich the mother of our Hostess, who also goes tomorrow. An hour ago Lord Ash<hi rend="italic">n</hi> set off for Winchester (8 miles off) where he is to be for a week, attending a muster of Hampshire Yeomanry, a social observance he will by no means neglect. So that in another day, we two and the Lady of the house shall have the field to ourselves,&#x2014;a most deserted field! For as it is, the flunkies in waiting very far exceed in numbers the persons to be waited on; and there reigns a <pb id="pg-23-127" n="23:127"/>silence everywhere, broken only by manoeuvrings of servants with more forms to go thro&#x2019;&#x2014;which to us, and perhaps to the people themselves, looks very strange. Add to which, the poor Lady by her last visit to Town caught an ugly cold with cough, and has remained in a partially eclipsed state ever since: did not appear at all for four or five days, and still does not come out to any meal, but is merely found sitting in the drawing-room when we return from dinner. These are strange quarters for the like of us!&#x2014;But what is best of all, we now see to the end of the affair; and calculate we shall be in our own little cell at Chelsea again, on the Saturday of next week;&#x2014;which really will be a welcome day to some of us, I think! Not that one does not prize the kindness of these friends; it is indeed great, constant, and worthy of all acceptance; but their way of life is one that would never suit me, that in fact I would not <hi rend="italic">have</hi>, on any account, if I had my choice of lives. Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the last three days, our weather has been very bad; no driving, or &#x201C;out-door relief&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pauper welfare in cash or kind, as opposed to committal to a workhouse.</note> of any sort for the womankind: Jane dare not even venture out for a whiff of my pipe when I am smoking, and neither of the others has crossed the threshold at all. For myself I always either go riding or else walking, and do not want for exercise: in virtue of which, and of the pure air and solitude, I really feel as if I had gained a little health, certainly not lost any; and the same, I think, is to be said of Jane.</p>
<p>Yesterday I walked to Alresford, partly under an umbrella; some three miles of the loveliest road, over a country all sunk in the silence of a moist <date when="1848-09">September</date> day. A pleasant simple country, with gentle heights and hollows, moderately fringed with wood; fields weedy, sluttishly tilled; wide &#x201C;downs&#x201D; (sheep-walks) green and sleek, all resting upon chalk; clusters of labourers&#x2019; cottages here and there (much trimmer than ours usually are), and almost as many Churches as farms,&#x2014;this Parish, for example, consists of 94 Souls. Alresford is a fine clean village, with wide streets and good red brick houses,&#x2014;about the size of Lockerby, but much preferable in appearance; various gentry and even nobility living in or close round it.&#x2014; The people here seem to me much less hard-worked than in the North; they are very ill off, I believe, if their Landlords did not help them;&#x2014;but seem to require much more to make them <hi rend="italic">well</hi> off than Scotch people do. Their cottages are mostly very clean with trees about them, flower-bushes into the very windows, and a trim road paved with bricks leading out from them to the public way. The ploughmen (or farm servants generally, for I have hardly seen anybody actually ploughing) go all about girt in <hi rend="italic">buckskin leggins</hi> from toe to mid-thigh, &#x201C;gay firm about the feet&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451001-TC-JWC-01"><sic>20:4</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1845-10-01">1 Oct. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> rags are seen <pb id="pg-23-128" n="23:128"/>nowhere; nor, I suppose, does <hi rend="italic">want</hi> anywhere do other than &#x201C;come upon the parish,&#x201D; and have itself supplied. The gentry, I imagine, take a great deal more of pains with their dependents than ours do.&#x2014; For the rest, as I said, the village is all more or less <hi rend="italic">sluttish;</hi> thistles abounding; turnips sown broadcast (and a very bad crop this year); bad fences, mostly <hi rend="italic">temporary</hi>, made of hazle wattles; abundance of waste ground (patches of bad wood or bushes), and in particular such a quantity of <hi rend="italic">roads</hi> and foot and bridle paths as fills a Scotchman with astonishment! I do believe there is something like <hi rend="italic">ten times</hi> as much ground occupied that way as there is with us. Nay, it seems virtually the rule, which I now act upon like the others, that you can <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> in any direction whatsoever, at your own pleasure; for whatever field you enter, there is almost sure to be a gap or a gate with a latch at the other side, and nobody dreams of finding fault with you.&#x2014; Such is Hampshire hereabouts;&#x2014;concerning which, as said above, the most interesting news for our Mother is that we are to quit it in about a week.</p>
<p>Dear Mother this is but a barren Letter to send you; but I know you reckon any Letter preferable to none. When I get back to Chelsea I hope to write to you with more elbow room.&#x2014; And now I must out and have my needful walk; there are walks and rides, &#x201C;green&#x201D; and red, I think, 20 miles long in this Park,&#x2014;and solitary, some of them, as if one were in the heart of America; no company whatever but squirrels and a few rooks&#x2014; <closer><salute>Tell Jack to write; remember us in all affection to Jamie, Isabella, Jenny and everyone&#x2014;and beware of this damp, dear Mother My heart&#x2019;s blessing with you</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
 <p>Returning from a sojourn of some weeks in the Country, I find your Note lying; and lose no time in doing the small service you ask of me. Mr Mill&#x2019;s domestic address is either 17 or 18 Kensington Square, Kensington; a place easy to find: but I generally catch him best about the India House, some time before 3 O&#x2019;clock in the day.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Stuart Mill (<date when="1806">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873">73</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18711"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), essayist, economist, and philosopher; see earlier vols. East India House, Leadenhall St., where Mill was third asst. examiner (an executive administrator), was the headquarters of the East India Co., a commercial company which in effect ruled a large part of India. TC&#x2019;s relations with Mill had cooled, but there had been no final rupture. Years later, either he or TC misremembering, the American Charles Eliot Norton (<date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1908">1908</date>) reported TC&#x2019;s saying that &#x201C;the last time we ever met&#x201D; was when TC invited Mill to dinner on Margaret Fuller&#x2019;s visit in <date when="1846">1846</date> and Mill &#x201C;received me like the very incarnation of the East Wind, and refused my invitation peremptorily&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Letters of Charles Eliot Norton</hi>, ed. Sarah Norton [<date when="1913">1913</date>] 1:500).</note> He is a man of somewhat cold and &#x201C;logical&#x201D; manner, but full of humanity and varied Knowledge,&#x2014;easy to talk with sensibly on any subject.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>You must give me a meeting, at your domicile, some day this week,&#x2014;any day and hour <hi rend="italic">before</hi> Saturday Noon. I want to consult you about &#x201C;new books,&#x201D; and to borrow some new books from you, of an eligible quality. &#x201C;Eligible&#x201D; for a Country drawingroom and its donothing elegants, partridge-shooting parliamenteers, and others such;&#x2014;not for myself, Heavens, no! But I am bound by a kind of duty to do the best I can in this poor service, and you must help me.</p>
<p>We returned on Thursday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> last,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1848-10-05">5 Oct.</date></note> quite sated with the Country and its amusements; we dimly understand you too to be rusticating, perhaps about Wilsden or Neasdon,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Willesden and Neasden, NW London suburbs.</note> except upon field days. Shortly I shall know better; and, if it please the pigs, we shall have some free exchange of news before long.&#x2014; Will you gather out those Squire Papers for me ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my coming; and add to them the &#x201C;Article&#x201D; rubbish,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the unpbd. article on the French Republic; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480804-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, [ca. <date when="1848-08-04">4 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> that I may purify my place by fire, and endeavour again to start, at least on clear ground. This peccant matter, I believe, will have to come out as a Book; for I dare not undertake at present to get upon an inverted tub, and preach to the populace, in its (and my) actual bewildered condition. The poor blockheads know little what is coming upon them from the justly angry gods! They will go on trafficking and babbling, marrying and giving in marriage<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 24:38.</note> till (as once formerly) the Noah&#x2019;s Deluge come suddenly, and end their little Russell and them.&#x2014; <foreign>Basta</foreign> [Enough]!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-23-131" n="23:131"/>One of the Books I must have on my own account is that former Copy of Goldsmith, which you admitted was at any rate mine.</p>

Espinasse speaks of him as a young man &#x201C;who, while under twenty, and engaged in the Manchester cotton-trade, had written, in the purest Carlylese, a biography of Mirabeau, the only one, so far as I know, of any mark as yet produced in England. From his diminutive stature he was known to his friends as &#x2018;little Smith,&#x2019; but he was clever, fairly accomplished, and remarkably fluent, both as a writer and a speaker. He was ambitious withal, and his ambition not unnaturally was directed towards literary life in London. &#x2026; His life of Mirabeau had brought him into correspondence with Carlyle. On knowing him personally, Carlyle came to like the little man, whom, however, from his over-readiness to flare up about anything or nothing, the Sage compared to &#x2018;turpentine&#x2019;&#x201D; (341&#x2013;42).</sourceNote><head>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Book on <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi> was long ago duly delivered me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury had written to JWC, [<date when="1848-08-30">30?

He is the most natural, simple, good-hearted, almost rustic little fellow one can see&#x2014;as good-hearted as possible, with a little round, fresh-coloured, beardless face, and sparkling black eyes&#x2014;as unlike his subject as possible&#x201D; (Ireland 252).</note> and I read up and down in it, good part of the whole; but it was borrowed away from me before I could finish, and has never yet come back;&#x2014;which must serve as the excuse for my delay in acknowledging your kindness in that matter. If I may support my own imperfect ju<supplied>[d]</supplied>gement<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> of the work by that of intelligent friends, whose opportunity has been more complete, I may, in returning thanks for kindness to myself, congratulate you on having produced a really creditable Book, worthy in its own place, and giving promise of still better. A reverence for <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> in your fellow man, which, if well understood, means all kinds of <hi rend="italic">manful wrath</hi> in them; in yourself a sincerity, fidelity, and piety of nature, which are rare at present: these, with the proved disposition to cultivate them, are a superior endowment for a <pb id="pg-23-132" n="23:132"/>young man. I can bid you persevere with all strenuousness; grudging no labour or endurance to perfect, according to best ability, what gifts are in you: encumbrances, foreign dross, and entanglements will (thro&#x2019; valiant effort on your part) work themselves off more and more completely; the battle is severe, but the victory too is worth something!</p>
<p>For the rest if a man really has a ray of immortal Intelligence in him (as indeed all men have if they durst know it), I do not think he need be in <hi rend="italic">haste</hi> to write Books with it just now;&#x2014;perhaps he may discover that the real end of Intelligence in man is not a &#x201C;word,&#x201D; nor a thought nor book, but an &#x201C;action&#x201D; (as the old Sages have it, and alas, as the new have it not),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 155.</note> and that only till action is denied him, which is but rarely the case, can his best function be the writing of mere books! In short, let there be no <hi rend="italic">theory</hi> in your next Book, if I may advise you, nor any disappointment however the preliminaries may prolong themselves: the longer the <hi rend="italic">roasting</hi>, and the hotter the furnace, the better always and purer is the metal! Perhaps too you will next try some <hi rend="italic">English</hi> subject? Best of all, I think, if some <hi rend="italic">Lancashire</hi> one,&#x2014;such as you yourself have seen, and experienced and conquered, and can speak a wise word on! There is no region in the universe more abundant in huge things as yet unspoken, and which deserve and earnestly demand speaking!&#x2014; <closer><salute>With many kind wishes and regards</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Here is a <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> fit to fight the very French with, if you ever came to try that operation with such an implement!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the gift of a walking stick, connected with Ashburton&#x2019;s recent visit to France.</note> I hope you could hardly anywhere be better suited with a civilised Hercules&#x2019; Club; and I wish you may long wield it in an adequate manner,&#x2014;on the hygienic side, what more need I wish?</p>
<p>Certain Books, of given quality but indefinite name, were to be provided for her Ladyship: you will find two Packets, the best I could lay hold <pb id="pg-23-133" n="23:133"/>of, waiting at Bath House, under your address;&#x2014;I fear much I am redundant in bulk, but in all other respects defective! However, pray carry them <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, if you can, and let herself choose. If you cannot, then you must open the Packets at your own risk; reject what you think least promising, and let these be sent hither straightway to their doom. The biggest Book of all,&#x2014;in the <hi rend="italic">London-Library</hi> Packet,&#x2014;is a volume of <hi rend="italic">Montfaucon</hi>, containing nothing to order except a very poor account of the <hi rend="italic">Bayeux Tapestry</hi>, which in case of need you might reject <hi rend="italic">without</hi> much scruple.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bernard de Montfaucon (<date when="1655">1655</date>&#x2013;<date when="1741">1741</date>), French Benedictine monk and scholar, founder of the science of paleography, author of <hi rend="italic">Les Monumens de la Monarchie Fran&#x26;ccedil;aise</hi>, 5 vols. (Paris, <date when="1729">1729</date>&#x2013;<date when="1733">33</date>). Vol. 1 (<date when="1729">1729</date>), illus. with fifteen double plates (372&#x2013;79), describes the Bayeux tapestry (see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451104-TC-LHB-01"><sic>20:42</sic><corr>TC to LHB, <date when="1845-11-04">4 Nov. 1845</date></corr></ref>); vol. 2 (<date when="1730">1730</date>), with nine plates, continues the account.</note>&#x2014; The other Packet is all of borrowed Books, except one (<hi rend="italic">Goldsmith</hi>) which is my own;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster&#x2019;s recent biography.</note> they are much at the service of The Grange for a six-weeks to come.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, if not again tonight, I will make an attempt to see you. Of her Ladyship we hear today,&#x2014;in a favourable tone. A bad day for her journey home, this. She ought to take care of herself, especially at this season.</p>
<p>I hope you have seen Cavaignac and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> under good auspices; and <hi rend="italic">enjoyed</hi> &#x201C;the abomination of desolation&#x201D; he presides over,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 24:15.</note> since you elect to enjoy it! By all appearance we shall have something of the like within our own coasts before very long, if mere hidebound Pedantry and parliamentary Palaver (as is likely) continue to &#x201C;govern&#x201D; us!</p>

<p>I have not forgotten you; I do not think I shall forget you,&#x2014;not till next week, or later. If that were but of any benefit! But of what is it, or can it be, to any but my foolish self alone?&#x2014; God is great!</p>
<p>Thanks, at any rate, for the good punctual Letter. You are always good and best; and will always be so, if it please Heaven. To me your goodness&#x2014;if I could but repay it, were I not the richest of all men?&#x2014;</p>
<p>I called thrice on Lord Ashburton,&#x2014;as if I had somehow expected to find great treasures there:&#x2014;the third time, yesterday, he was come (utterly wearied, as I guessed) and gone. And now your Company is all coming;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are not to expose yourself, and take to coughing again, in this <pb id="pg-23-134" n="23:134"/>wretched weather: that is the charge I lay on you; we cannot have you ill again! There is enough wrong otherwise, in my opinion; quite enough.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">borrowed</hi> Books are mine, and yours, &#x201C;for any length of time&#x201C;: if you want more or other tell me. I fancy a written List came with the borrowed Parcel: you have but to keep it, and bid Mason<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An Ashburton servant.</note> be punctual <hi rend="italic">at last</hi>,&#x2014;and no hurry at all with that &#x201C;last.&#x201D; Enough of that.</p>
<p>I have taken to scribbling on paper; but have to burn it all, so soon as scribbled. Woe is me! How can I write on Ireland, or on any earthly thing, when day and night my poor head is in a welter of bewilderments, and the highest is mingled for me with the lowest, and in a too sad sense &#x201C;Chaos is come again&#x201D;?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 3.3.</note> That must alter, that must end, if there be any life left me at all.</p>
<p>You will write to my Wife some day? If I know that you are <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, I will believe all the rest,&#x2014;even I the doubter. And pray observe again, this is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">not received</hi>,&#x201C;&#x2014;the more is the pity!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have intended you a Letter for some days; but not till now, when a word from Emerson practically applying to you has arrived,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1848-10-02">2 Oct.</date>, but only a fragment of the rough draft survives. It was partly about his trying to find an American publisher for John Carlyle&#x2019;s trans. of the <hi rend="italic">Inferno.</hi> When the Boston firm of Ticknor declined, he then submitted it to Harper&#x2019;s (Rusk 4:105&#x2013;6), who eventually decided to publish it, paying the trans. &#x201C;nothing but American fame &#x26; ten copies&#x201D; (Rusk 4:124). John Carlyle wrote to TC, [<date when="1848-10-23">23 Oct.</date>], that, as instructed by Emerson, he had sent the last four sheets in the first week of <date when="1848-07">Aug.</date> to John Chapman to transmit to Monroe &#x26; Co., Boston.</note> could my pious small purpose ripen to activity. I have been much beaten about with what our Mother calls &#x201C;ae trade and another,&#x201D; and day after day passes, in a confused manner, without effect.&#x2014; Emerson&#x2019;s report of Yankee negociations need not distress you at all: perhaps it is but the <hi rend="italic">shortest</hi> way, this offer he has got, towards a result which in any case would have been essentially the same. Get your Preface done; and be thankful that you do not need ever to mind about &#x201C;sales&#x201D; and remunerations either there or <pb id="pg-23-135" n="23:135"/>here. That, and the getting of one&#x2019;s work done are surely grounds for thankfulness.</p>
 <p>We have extremely wet, cold and wild weather here; and almost no other news at all. Cholera is babbled of in the Newspapers; but seems to be a small matter as yet (if indeed it be as yet a matter at all), and rational people do not speak of it, or that only in the most transient way. I saw Forster last week, ill of bile, as I myself very decidedly was; Southwood Smith, now some kind of constituted authority in Hygienics, had been palavering him to a great rate about the &#x201C;pestilence in the whole air&#x201D; &#x26;c:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Southwood Smith (<date when="1788">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861">1861</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25917"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380918-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:183</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-09-18">18 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>), public health reformer, had been appointed, in <date when="1848-08">Sept.</date>, medical member of the gen. board of health. He wrote its <hi rend="italic">Report &#x2026; on the Epidemic Cholera of <date when="1848">1848</date> &#x26; <date when="1849">1849</date></hi> (Parl. Papers 21 [<date when="1850">1850</date>]), also signed by Chadwick and Lord Ashley, which recorded the first attack, <date when="1848-09-22">22 Sept.</date>, the worst point, <date when="1849-09">Sept. 1849</date>, and the last death, <date when="1849-12-22">22 Dec. 1849</date>, saying that it was &#x201C;one epidemic with two well marked periods &#x2026; <date when="1848-08">September</date> to <date when="1849-03">March</date>, and &#x2026; <date when="1849-06">June</date> to <date when="1849-12">December</date>&#x201D; (12&#x2013;13). The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> and other newspapers gave regular reports on its progress.</note> I cured myself at once by the easy method of one blue pill and a soda draught; Fuz too is now better, I suppose by the help of nature. What little we have to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> in Cholera, should it actually visit us, we know fully; and the rest&#x2014;is clearly peaceable <hi rend="italic">silence.</hi> Southwood had furnished Fuz with a recipe of pills &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">pro re nat&#xe2;</hi></foreign> [for an emergency],&#x201D; should any grumbling occur of a suspicious character in the bowels:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle replied, [<date when="1848-10-23">23 Oct.</date>], with general advice on cholera and Forster&#x2019;s grumbling bowels: &#x201C;Neither Jane nor yourself have any errors in diet or regimen to correct. &#x2026; That mixture of Smith&#x2019;s is good of its kind, but not better than the blue pill to which one has been accustomed. One is sorry to see the folly with which the disease is looked forward to in London. Forster published some very good suggestions from the Dublin Physicians, in his paper a week or two since, and should stick to them.&#x201D;</note> Fuz sent it to me with charges yesterday; I have got the pills, believing them to be insignificantly beneficial in such a contingency: &#x201C;<foreign>Hydrag creta</foreign> gr ii, <foreign>Quinin. sulph</foreign> gr vi, <foreign>Confect. Opiat.</foreign> gr xxx&#x201D;; mix <foreign><hi rend="italic">optime</hi></foreign>, and make 12 pills,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic"><foreign>pro re nat&#xe2;</foreign>.</hi> So much for Hygienics.</p>

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
 <p>It was not till last night that I could discover for myself any distinct plan of attempting to convey a word of sympathy to you, in this the time of your distress;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Whether Gavan Duffy&#x2019;s friends appealed to TC for help is not known, but events may have redirected TC&#x2019;s attention to him. Duffy had been arrested, <date when="1848-07-09">9 July</date>; and at the end of the month the national uprising (see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480826-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1848-08-26">26 Aug.</date></ref>) was followed by the arrest and trial of its leaders. Some attempt was made, without success, to involve Duffy in Smith O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s trial for high treason, which ended, <date when="1848-10-08">8 Oct.</date>, when, though the jury recommended mercy, he was sentenced to be hanged and quartered. The same sentence was passed on Terence Bellew MacManus (<sic><date when="1823">1823</date>?</sic><corr><date when="1811">1811</date>/<date when="1812">12</date></corr>&#x2013;<sic><date when="1860">60</date></sic><date when="1861">61</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17691"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Patrick O&#x2019;Donoghue (d. <date when="1854">1854</date>), and Thomas Francis Meag<corr>h</corr>er (<date when="1823">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867">67</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18483"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) on <date when="1848-10-12">12</date>, <date when="1848-10-15">15</date>, and <date when="1848-10-21">21 Oct.</date> The prosecution had meanwhile put off Duffy&#x2019;s trial at Clonmel for treason-felony in favor of a charge of high treason carrying the death penalty, but it lacked evidence. On <date when="1848-10-23">23 Oct.</date> he was ready for trial in Dublin for felony, while his associates were under sentence of death, though it was known that this would be reduced to transportation. No doubt special attempts were then made to help him. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-10-21">21 Oct.</date>, reported the discovery of Duffy&#x2019;s intended escape, <date when="1848-10-16">16 Oct.</date>, when a valise was found in his cell with a rope and rope ladder. He was &#x201C;removed to the criminal side of the prison&#x201D; and his trial was expected on <date when="1848-10-23">23</date> or <date when="1848-10-24">24 Oct.</date> In fact, the prosecution&#x2019;s errors led to further postponement.</note> and I know not still, for certain, whether the small enterprise can <pb id="pg-23-138" n="23:138"/>take effect. If this bit of Paper do reach you within your strait walls,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy says that while Smith O&#x2019;Brien had been on trial, &#x201C;I was strictly prohibited from receiving or sending out letters, except with the sanction of the Governor of the prison&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Four Years of Irish History, <date when="1845">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">1849</date></hi> [<date when="1883">1883</date>] 797); but TC wrote to him through one of his counsel, John O&#x2019;Hagan (<date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890">90</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20623"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450500-TC-JOCH-01"><sic>19:66</sic><corr>TC to JOCH, <date when="1845-05-01">1 May 1845</date></corr></ref>), who replied, <date when="1848-10-25">25 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;There was no difficulty in conveying your letter to Duffy, and I now send you one from him in reply. Neither letter was seen by any official: Those who have access to him (his wife and his lawyers) are obliged to sign a pledge against bringing into, or out of the prison any documents of a political nature, or any intended for publication, but this restriction does not extend to private letters, which Duffy has freely written and received since his committal to prison.&#x201D;</note> let it be an assurance that you are still dear to me; that in this sad crisis which has now arrived we here at Chelsea do not find new cause for blame, superadded to the old, but new cause for pity and respect, and loving candour,&#x2014;and for hope still, in spite of all! The one blame I ever had to lay upon you, as you well know, was that, like a young heroic all-trusting Irish soul, you had <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> in the prophesying of a plausible Son of Lies preaching deliverance to your poor Country;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel O&#x2019;Connell. In reply, from Newgate Jail, <date when="1848-10-23">23 Oct.</date>, Duffy wrote that &#x201C;all the evils that have befallen me have given me less pain than I would suffer if you told me I had forfeited your good opinion by any unworthy conduct. I set your friendship as an ample counterbalance against half of my personal ill&#x2014;the half that does not involve the will of the Irish cause. Nevertheless I have a serious quarrel with you, which if I had any chance of seeing you for many years I would scarcely forgive. That first article in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> on Ireland [&#x2018;Repeal of the Union,&#x2019; <date when="1848-04-29">29 April</date>] was most cruel and unjust. I read it in a storm of grief and indignation; and though your malign prophecies have been accomplished and we are &#x2018;squelched&#x2019; for the present the rule of England here is not less the empire of Hell, nor your scorn a whit less cruel and unpardonable. If you knew the men and the system you have helped to maintain in Ireland you might well wonder at your company. Mean, paltry, selfish villains without courage or capacity of any kind, and who do not know what truth means. I laughed with bitter satisfaction when their accomplished Solicitor General, on Martin&#x2019;s trial, accused us of being infidels and destructives on the strength of a quotation, in some of our writings, from Thomas Carlyle [meaning the freethinker Richard Carlile (<date when="1790">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843">1843</date>) a person prosecuted for selling infamous publications!&#x201D;</note> and believing, had, as you were bound in that case, proceeded to put the same in practice, cost what it might cost to you. Even in this wild course, often enough denounced by me, I have to give you this testimony, that your conduct was never other than noble; that whoever might shew himself savage, narrow-minded, hateful in his hatred, C. G. Duffy always was humane and dignified and manful;&#x2014;nay often enough, in the midst of those mad tumults, I had to recognise a voice of clear modest wisdom and courageous veracity, admonishing &#x201C;Repealers&#x201D; that their true enemy was not England after all; that Repeal from England, <pb id="pg-23-139" n="23:139"/>except accompanied by <hi rend="italic">Repeal from the Devil</hi>, would and could do nothing for them: and this most welcome true voice, almost the only one such I could hear in Ireland, was the same C. G. Duffy&#x2019;s. Courage, my friend; all is not yet lost! A tragic destiny has severed you from that one source of mischief in your life: let this, tho&#x2019; at such a hideous cost to you, be <hi rend="italic">welcome</hi>, as instruction dear-bought but indispensable! By Heaven&#x2019;s blessing, this is no <foreign><hi rend="italic">finis</hi></foreign> in your course, but the <foreign>finis</foreign> only of a huge mistake; and the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> of a much nobler course, delivered from that. I mean what I say. The soul of a man <hi rend="italic">can</hi> by no agency, of men or of devils, be lost and ruined, but by his own only; in all scenes and situations this is true;&#x2014;and if you are the true man I take you to be, you will find it so yet. Courage, I say; courage, patience, and for a time <hi rend="italic">pious silence!</hi> If it please God, there is yet a day given us; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all</hi> days have not set,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Livy, <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> 39:26; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461219-TC-LHB-01"><sic>21:114</sic><corr>TC to LHB, <date when="1846-12-19">19 Dec. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> no, only some of them!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Dear Duffy, I know not whether you can send me any word of remembrance from the place where you are, but rather understand that you <hi rend="italic">cannot;</hi> nor is it material, for I can supply the word. But if now, or henceforth at any time while I live, I could be of any honest service to you, by my resources or connexions here or otherwise, surely it would be very welcome news to me.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his reply, <date when="1848-10-23">23 Oct.</date>, Duffy continued: &#x201C;Yes I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> hope that the drama of life is only at the second Act with me &#x2026; . That I will be transported I have no doubt, but I do not mean to waste the years of exile. If I am permitted I will spend them in study and discipline &#x2026; . But this is unhappily very doubtful. Lord Clarendon has conceived a strong personal dislike to me, because (as I am told) he thinks I produced an insurrectionary movement in Ireland at the very moment when his sagacity was pledged to his colleagues that it was impossible. I am opined by the best informed friends that he is determined to treat me differently, and <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than the other Political Prisoners. You will think this is impossible, but the belief is general. For example it is said that they are to be kept together, to wear their ordinary dress and to occupy their time as they please, and that I am to be separated from them, refused the use of books and dressed as a convict. The <hi rend="italic">pretence</hi> for this distinction will probably be my intended escape, whereas the escape was prompted <hi rend="italic">entirely</hi> by the knowledge of this peculiar malignity against me.&#x201D; He asked TC frankly to help to prevent this: &#x201C;I know not whether this will be at all within the range of your influence, but as it is all I have to ask of Fortune at present I mention it to you.&#x201D;</note> Farewell for the present. My Wife joins in affectionate salutation to you.&#x2014; That Autumn evening on the Pier at Kingston, with your kind figure and Mitchel&#x2019;s in the crowd,&#x2014;yes, it will be memorable tome while I continue in this world!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460823-JWC-TC-01"><sic>21:26</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1846-08-23">23 Aug. 1846</date></corr></ref>. On receipt of this letter O&#x2019;Hagan wrote to TC, <date when="1848-10-25">25 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Your letter &#x2026; has given him more gratification than anything which has occurred since the casting down of his immediate hopes for Ireland. &#x2026; / His health has naturally suffered from confinement and consequent dyspepsia, though not so much as I anticipated, and his spirits are wonderfully good. &#x2026; He will be tried by a jury of his political enemies as is the rule at present in Ireland; the odds are therefore overwhelmingly against him. It is rumoured besides, and I fear the rumour is not quite unfounded that in case of his conviction it is the intention of the government to treat him with peculiar hardship. If this should prove to be so that influence which you so kindly offer to exert in his behalf may be most valuable. &#x2026; / As for the rest of &#x2018;the big matters&#x2019; &#x2026; what can I have to say that you would care to hear? The just claims of Ireland which we embodied in repeal, were not, we believe, extinguished on Ballingarry Common, and so far as our cause consisted of hollow boasting, it is right to have it proved hollow. The immeasurable affliction is the loss to Ireland &#x2026; of so much talent and values &#x2026; the severance from us of men like Duffy.&#x201D; O&#x2019;Hagan was &#x201C;much honoured by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s remembrance&#x201D; and sent her his &#x201C;respectful regards.&#x201D;</note> <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>. / Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<p>If you were a Socinian,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles use &#x201C;Socinian&#x201D; merely to mean Unitarian; but see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430204-JWC-HW-01"><sic>16:46</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1843-02-04">4 Feb. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> duly inspired by the precept &#x201C;Let your care be the welfare of others&#x201D; you would not give way to those long fits of silence; for a letter from you always promotes <hi rend="italic">my</hi> welfare, considerably, for the time being. You write very nice letters and you are a very nice cousin, and I <pb id="pg-23-141" n="23:141"/>have no fault to find with you but that you are not sufficiently sensible of your own importance to me.</p>
<p>For <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> I am incorrigible as to &#x201C;the welfare of others&#x201C;&#x2014;at least in the matter of letter writing the idea of <hi rend="italic">giving pleasure</hi> cannot prevail with me to write and I write always from one of two motives, from a <hi rend="italic">need</hi> to <hi rend="italic">receive</hi> a letter, only to be extracted by <hi rend="italic">giving</hi> one, or from gratitude for what is vouchsafed me &#x201C;on the voluntary principle. The latter motive sets my pen agoing just now&#x2014;and an exceedingly bad pen it is!&#x2014; Jeanie having been a better correspondent lately has kept me up with the current of your affairs, and I trusted to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to keep you up with the current of mine. All the five weeks I spent at the Grange I was kept in a whirl of things amounting to what Anthony Sterling calls &#x201C;a state of mind&#x201C;&#x2014; I wrote few letters&#x2014;and those were not worth having&#x2014; I was very glad to get back to Chelsea again where I might find some <hi rend="italic">work</hi> however humble, and call my soul my own&#x2014;to a certain extent&#x2014;and it was full time! for I was got so habituated to the vastness and splendour of the Grange, and the luxury of all sorts; that for the first time in my life my own home looked excessively <hi rend="italic">small</hi> and poverty-stricken to me on first returning to it!&#x2014; Part of this impression was owing I suppose to the new paint and paper, which impaired that familiar face of <hi rend="italic">Home</hi> which on other occasions had always compensated for difference of size and decoration&#x2014; my room was clean and tidy to a degree! but it was a room without associations for me till I had got all the little pictures, books &#x26;c replaced and various incongruities reconciled; for instance, there was a splendid <hi rend="italic">mirror</hi> over the mantle piece a present from Lady Harriet; and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> threw the home-made chintz window curtains quite out of keeping; we have now got <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> red stuff curtains with brass poles&#x2014;only think! and things begin to feel straight again&#x2014; But what is all that to you who live according to Helen Mitchell &#x201C;in the very beautifulest house in the whole earth&#x2014; no! there&#x2019;s not the match of it!&#x2014; On the mantle piece of <hi rend="italic">every</hi> bedroom a pair of candle sticks: <hi rend="italic">real</hi> china the very pattern of some in Christy&#x2019;s shop!!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Henry Christey, wholesale china dealer, 1 Union Row, the Minories.</note>&#x2014;six and sixpence the pair!!&#x2014;&#x201D; In fact since Helen came to hand she has done nothing but talk of this house and the beautiful Land (Lawn?) before it&#x2014;and the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">grawn</hi> dinner&#x201D; that was cooking and the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">grawn</hi> dresses on the bed&#x201D;!&#x2014; She arrived last night having been expected since Saturday and in crossing the threshold her first words to me were&#x2014;&#x201C;I&#x2019;m afu late!&#x201D; her second&#x2014;&#x201C;Eh! sic a bonny hoose ye ken!&#x201D;&#x2014; I thought she meant my own &#x2018;hoose&#x2019; and wondered what she saw of it in the dark&#x2014;at the door step&#x2014;but it was &#x201C;Miss Welsh&#x2019;s hoose&#x201D; I soon found&#x2014;Heaven knows how she will prosper&#x2014;she has a strange half-witted look after the calm rational Anne&#x2014; But to each their merits and demerits&#x2014;time will show how <pb id="pg-23-142" n="23:142"/>the balance lies.

<salute>Dear Lord Clarendon,</salute>
<p>You were so very good to me on a former occasion,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480526-TC-LC-01">TC to <sic>Lord C</sic><corr>LC</corr>, <date when="1848-05-26">26 May</date></ref>.</note> perhaps I may be allowed to intrude again with a word of testimony on behalf of another unfortunate fellow creature now smarting for his &#x201C;Repeal&#x201D; enterprises: C. G. Duffy I mean; the only other of that unfortunate company of whom I ever had any knowledge&#x2014;, or have the small claim to speak here.</p>
<p>How Duffy may stand in your Lordship&#x2019;s judgement I do not know; but it is very important for himself, and not without importance for all of us just now, that he should stand in his real likeness there;&#x2014;the rather if there be any truth in those rumours one hears, that he stands very ill with some of your subordinates in Ireland, and that it is not unlikely a peculiar and <pb id="pg-23-144" n="23:144"/>exceptional severity may be exercised against him, unless your Lordship interpose.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clarendon seems to have respected Duffy as an opponent. On <date when="1848-06-03">3 June</date> he wrote to Lord Grey, the home sec.: &#x201C;The command is now entirely in the hands of Duffy &#x2026; who as an organizer &#x26; a man to contrive what is really practicable to the Irish character is probably superior to Mitchel and therefore more formidable.&#x201D; By <date when="1849-07-09">9 July 1849</date>, when the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> was about to restart, he was to tell Grey, &#x201C;We shall have much trouble with him for he understands the theory of agitation and turning poverty and discontent to his account&#x201D; (Clarendon Papers). But there is nothing to show a particular personal dislike, though Duffy says that &#x201C;it was undoubtedly the opinion of the public and press at that time&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Four Years of Irish History</hi> [<date when="1883">1883</date>] 725n).</note> To me Duffy has been known personally, in some degree, these several years; I have read many of his Newspaper Articles, and had various opportunities to observe him, converse with him, and deliberately form some judgement of him and his affairs,&#x2014;which, as it essentially differs from the <hi rend="italic">rumoured</hi> one just hinted at, I am surely bound to convey to the proper ear for it, if I can. And indeed, apart from my private regard and pity for this poor man, may I not say it would be a little painful to me, on other grounds, if a mistake were committed in his instance,&#x2014;if not Duffy were doomed but a fallacious Appearance of Duffy,&#x2014;and an otherwise triumphantly successful management (grateful to all good citizens) of a most complex and ugly coil of affairs were, even in small items, deformed by any look of injustice or partiality. If the rumour just alluded to have no foundation, then pray excuse this trouble,&#x2014;and read no farther, except perhaps for curiosity&#x2019;s sake.</p>
<p>Duffy came to me some four or five years ago, and talked and answered, a whole evening here;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450428-TC-MAC-01"><sic>19:64&#x2013;66</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1845-04-28">28 April 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> leaving with all of us a lively impression both of his own genial frank affectionate character, and of the tragic bewilderment into which the whole course of his practical convictions and endeavours had been, as it were, <hi rend="italic">enchanted</hi> by that Arch-Humbug, and Servant of the Father of Lies (for such I must consider, and on occasion call him) &#x201C;Liberator O&#x2019;Connel,&#x201C;&#x2014;to whom, from the earliest awakening of intelligence, he had listened as to an inspired Prophet, and whose pretended will he was now bent with his whole strength to do, and <hi rend="italic">thereby</hi> work salvation for Ireland. No sadder phenomenon connected with that sad country had ever presented itself to me. Here was poor Duffy, by appearance an Irish Peasant&#x2019;s son,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was a shopkeeper&#x2019;s son, largely self-educated.</note> yet a natural <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi>, and almost man of genius; sense and faculty and generosity and fine gifts, abundantly manifest in him: with his broad rude Irish face, with his deep-toned Irish voice, full of natural melody and <hi rend="italic">brogue</hi>, he came before me as the <hi rend="italic">Spokesman</hi> of long dumb generations of his poor Ancestors and Countrymen; long had they lain dumb, trodden down <hi rend="italic">below</hi> speech by every conceivable oppression; and <pb id="pg-23-145" n="23:145"/>here at last was a <hi rend="italic">Voice</hi> given them;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> (thanks to Liberator O&#x2019;Connel) was the use it was about to make of itself! Never had I seen more clearly what the nature of all <hi rend="italic">Lying</hi>, public or private, is; how an incalculable curse follows it,&#x2014;how all men should fly from it as for their life!&#x2014;Poor Duffy&#x2019;s history as we now see it, is epitomized to me in that first glimpse I got of him.</p>
<p>But deducting that baleful <hi rend="italic">foreign</hi> element, which has now come to such a tragic issue for the poor man, I am convinced your Lordship, on personal inspection, would find nothing else to blame in him beyond other men,&#x2014;and certainly very much to praise and pity! He is a man of gentle soft nature; I think of a character sensitive and vehement, rather than deep or strong: Mitchel had far more of the fighter and knight-errant; and, in spite of their appearances, I should guess that the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Physical-Force</hi>&#x201D; movement did not originate with Duffy; and that his incitations to continue it at last were grounded, if I may so speak, rather on his superior <hi rend="italic">honesty</hi>,&#x2014;on his conviction that &#x201C;Repeal,&#x201D; to which he had sworn fealty, had no chance at all but this desperate one, which his inexperience led him to forget, what was becoming plain to his more cunning and less sincere associates, that his chance was indeed desperate and worse than none.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After Mitchel&#x2019;s transportation, Duffy was led from being against physical force to supporting it.</note> In the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> Newspaper, which I looked into for several years,&#x2014;always till within a few months of its suppression, when it had grown too painful and provoking to look into,&#x2014;I noticed that Duffy worked for most part on Literary Matters, leaving the &#x201C;Political&#x201D; to others; and here I could not but recognise his worth as a critic, how on occasions he showed a correct and zealous appreciation of intellectual excellence, but of moral still more; and indeed was constantly endeavouring to teach &#x201C;Repealers&#x201D; and others some doctrine more wholesome than welcome to them; and would ever and anon remind them (no doubt with <hi rend="italic">risk</hi> of his party connexions) that &#x201C;repeal from England&#x201D; would do nothing, unless repeal from their own vices, their own sloths, unveracities, blusterings and incoherencies (what I call &#x201C;Repeal from the Devil&#x201D;), should accompany it. This I noticed in Duffy all along, and in him almost alone of the fraternity: and in a word I have to testify that his bearing, in that dark disastrous insane element of O&#x2019;Connel Repeal, had, whenever I caught sight of him, a certain manfulness, mild dignity, and effective sincerity, which pleaded for him with me.</p>
<p>On the whole I always construed him as intrinsically a Man of Letters, <hi rend="italic">incidentally driven</hi> to become a Man of Action, and retaining always an invincible proclivity towards his old course,&#x2014;and capable withal to do some service there. Repeal being now lost, I consider that the one aim that <pb id="pg-23-146" n="23:146"/>can remain to him in life must be this original one; which surely it were well should not be shut against him, but if possible, since he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to live, be set wide open to him! I believe there might yet good come of Duffy. In some situation analagous to that of Mitchel (for which, in the name of Magnanimity and wise Clemency, let the Lord Lieutenant accept my thanks and those of all men!) he might grow to something useful yet, and do good to himself and perhaps to his poor Country too&#x2014; So be it, if the Powers permit!</p>
<p>This, dear Lord Clarendon is what I had to say of my own knowledge or clear conviction, about Duffy; and to this I will not add anything which might be of different origin. Of the late attempt at escape from prison, which I have heard of, I can say nothing, except that I hear Duffy&#x2019;s friends lament it, and alledge in excuse for him that it arose from his terror and quasi-frenzy at the thought (as &#x201C;rumour&#x201D; had menaced him) of being sent to consort, not with his old comrades in their exile, but with burglars and pickpockets, and the felons of Nature,&#x2014;to which class he assuredly does not belong. Whatever his faults and false frenzies, recent or ancient, he will find, I persuade myself, a just and humane judge now, who needs no counsel when the facts have become clear.</p>
<p>Towards which issue, may this small contribution of mine, if it be needed, find acceptance, and at any rate excuse. And pray do not take the trouble, among your many great affairs, to write an answer: the testimony will weigh with you, I believe, about what it is worth; and the &#x201C;answer,&#x201D; to it and to much else, will be seen by and by.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The next commission in Dublin, after which Duffy might be tried, was <date when="1848-12-15">15 Dec.</date>; but he survived until the fourth commission, <date when="1849-02-15">15 Feb. 1849</date>, when in spite of the jury being packed against him it did not agree.</note></p>
<p><closer><salute>With many thanks, and respects, and congratulations,</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>I have the honour to be</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read your Preface carefully, and about half of the Translation:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently Maccall&#x2019;s trans., pbd. as <hi rend="italic">A Treatise on Politics</hi> (<date when="1854">1854</date>), of the <hi rend="italic">Tractatus-Theologico-Politicus</hi> (<date when="1670">1670</date>) by Benedict (or Baruch) Spinoza (<date when="1632">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1677">77</date>), Dutch-Jewish humanist philosopher, condemned as a heretic by the Amsterdam Jewish congregation.</note> the <pb id="pg-23-147" n="23:147"/>latter, so far as I could judge in absence of the original, appeared to be well and carefully done,&#x2014;but finding the hand (contrary to expectation) somewhat indistinct to me, and not having any prospect of seizing the Author&#x2019;s drift, or otherwise coming to clearer insight of a practical sort, I desisted where I mention. The Preface, I am sorry to say, but I ought to say it at once, does not seem to me as if it would answer at all. It is much too <hi rend="italic">angry</hi>, emphatic, controversial,&#x2014;where there is, or well can be, no &#x201C;controversy&#x201D; on the part of the public, nothing but nescience and indifference as yet in that quarter. You do nothing to <hi rend="italic">invite</hi> us into your somewhat formidable Spinoza <foreign><hi rend="italic">Antre</hi></foreign>, or subterranean shrine; and this, I consider, was the one business of a Preface. Some short sketch of Spinoza&#x2019;s Life, if well managed; some quiet account of what the world has successively thought of him, and now thinks:&#x2014;all this (or much better than this) might have been some sort of introduction to what we are going to enter upon; but nothing of the present writing seems to me to tend at all decisively in that direction. Surely you should stand at the door of your Hostel with at least a peaceable face; not brandishing the war-club, and testifying that you do not care if we think <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a Pantheist &#x26;c &#x26;c. In short, my dear Sir, I do not think your Preface suitable either for Spinoza or for yourself; and were I the Bookseller of your <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi>, I should insist on having that suppressed, and some little bit of Biography, History, or even <hi rend="italic">Bibliography</hi> (for that is somewhat wanted here of itself, the origin, first publication &#x26;c of the Book being quite unknown, and rather enigmatic to us) substituted, or even no <hi rend="italic">Preface</hi> at all, in its stead. But, alas, I am more and more confirmed in the sad prognosis I gave you the other night, that no Bookseller will undertake this Work at present;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maccall&#x2019;s trans. was pbd. by John Chapman as vol. 5 of &#x201C;The Cabinet of Reason, a Library of Free Thought, Politics and Culture.&#x201D;</note> that to prosecute the attempt to any length, among that class, will but add chagrin and invitation to the other sorrows and toils already invested in this task by you! A most sad verdict to give; and given with quite other than joy, as you may well believe: but you will take it kindly of me, and with the candour you have, perhaps draw profit from it by and by rather than bootless pain. A man, of whom the Heavens intend to make a man in these times, has an immense quantity of sore lessons to learn;&#x2014;and you, I can perceive, are very much in that case. Courage! Be <hi rend="italic">open</hi> to your schooling; prompt to admit things painful if they are true. A man does grow, in that way, to know the will of the Eternal Destinies, and the nature of this terrene element, a little better, and to profit thereby; in <hi rend="italic">another</hi> way, he will not know or profit.</p>
<p>I have read with very much more pleasure the Two Printed Pieces,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Individuality of the Individual. A Lecture</hi> (<date when="1844">1844</date>) and <hi rend="italic">The Creed of Man</hi> (<date when="1845">1845</date>).</note>&#x2014;at <pb id="pg-23-148" n="23:148"/>least one of them, the &#x201C;Individuality of the Individual&#x201D;; for in the other, called &#x201C;Creed of a Man,&#x201D; tho&#x2019; I find a variety of true thoughts, and no opinion not easily pardoned even when dissented from, yet the form of the thing, so rigid, naked, skeleton-like, afflicts me, and there breathes out of it, pardon me if I almost say, something fierce, lean, fanatical; savouring sadly of your death-wrestle with the Socinian and other serpents;&#x2014;and not right or desirable, whencesoever derived. In your <hi rend="italic">lecture</hi> itself there is enough of all this visible; but there comes out farther a certain heroic brilliancy, and sound as of clanging steel, which are of much better omen to me. What you say here, and where I have fallen in with it elsewhere, about the &#x201C;Individuality of the Individual,&#x201D; I reckon to be perfectly just in its meaning; and indeed have found it recognised everywhere by all truly wise men, this long while: &#x201C;Be faithful to yourself and your endowment; <hi rend="italic">grow</hi> to what the Gods have appointed you for being,&#x201D; in this, sure enough, lies all the Law and the Prophets for a man. Nevertheless I grieve much to see it wrenched from its environments in this Manner, and spasmodically set up like a kind of &#x201C;new religion&#x201D;; which, according to my clear belief concerning it, is by no means its real place or attitude. Alas, it is in looking here that I see the sorrowfullest stock of contradictions, and painful experiences, till in many respects you learn <hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi>, laid up for you! Believe me, no man is called to use any <supplied>[but]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> the most solemn conviction of his in that way. New &#x201C;religions,&#x201D; and even <hi rend="italic">old</hi> if they had been set up in that way, are but a <hi rend="italic">ghastly</hi>, unfruitful, phantasmal kind of thing, one and all; and to found a Sect, to come forth as if one at all would or could found a Sect, is to me like a kind of spiritual suicide for a man of any geniality, at present! But here, alas, we have again the <hi rend="italic">Socinian Affair</hi>, not yet quite triumphed over, tho&#x2019; trampled low enough. Here, I believe, where your &#x201C;tendency to the abstract,&#x201D; and to much else, takes its rise;&#x2014;here, as I construe it, is the grand source of your impediments, not economical only but spiritual as well; and it is to cut you out from <hi rend="italic">this</hi> perhaps that your severest lessons, now and till it be accomplished, are appointed you! A brave man ought to come out of this, really ought, if he is capable of anything better.&#x2014; You have already achieved an immense victory; you have done what not one of a thousand, even who think they have done it, ever does: seen into the <hi rend="italic">damnable</hi> nature of all Cant and Conventionalism whatsoever: a man who has achieved this ought really to quit &#x201C;abstractions&#x201D;; let him swallow down his once &#x201C;divine-idea&#x201D; into the life-blood of him, and circulate it there, at all moments, thro&#x2019; everything he does and says,&#x2014;and in this murk of Egyptian midnight enveloping the poor sons of men everywhere, he will find enough to do, and to say of the <pb id="pg-23-149" n="23:149"/><hi rend="italic">concrete</hi> sort, I should think! But to stand on the highways, crying, &#x201C;Behold my divine-idea, idea by itself idea!&#x201D;&#x2014;this I think will never answer him; and has never answered the like of him,&#x2014;in spite of Spinoza&#x2019;s example, or rather I may say, <hi rend="italic">witness</hi> Spinoza&#x2019;s example. To him, and to all &#x201C;Socinian&#x201D; and Quasi Socinian people, including Antoninus, Epictetus &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (<date when="0121">121</date>&#x2013;<date when="0180">180</date>), Roman emperor and stoic philosopher. Epictetus (fl. ca. <date when="0080">80</date>&#x2013;<date when="0090">90</date>), Greek stoic philosopher who taught in Rome.</note> a brave man I rather think i<supplied>[s]</supplied> now called to say, with pity and affection, Farewell. Let us emerge from Orcus,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Latin name for the underworld.</note> and its pallid shadows, and logics, and articles and &#x201C;abstractions&#x201D;; let us enter into the busy light, where we have been long <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi>, and where our home and seedfield and battlefield is.</p>
<p>I know not, Dear Sir, whether all this, which has far exceeded what I meant to write, can do anything but grieve you. That surely was not the purpose of it!&#x2014; On the whole my practical conclusion is, that Spinoza will in no way do anything for you; and that, on trial, which of course you will incline to make with Parker or others, you ought to be prepared for admitting such an unwelcome result. For the rest, that your much likeliest outlook, for the immediate occasion, seems to lie in <hi rend="italic">Lecturing;</hi> in which enterprise, if you will resolutely throw all &#x201C;abstractions&#x201D; behind you, and insist on something (almost anything) concrete, and on that alone, I promise you considerable success by degrees. Try Northampton, therefore;&#x2014;or if you cannot get on there, let us endeavour to find you some other place. And believe in general that I, for one, would gladly help you if I could. and, in any case, pray let me know before the <hi rend="italic">cruise</hi> quite fail.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Kings 17:14; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cruise</hi>&#x201D; thus in MS.</note> <closer><salute>And, Courage!

Yesterday I went into the City for money; returned walking: the streets were clammy with thick mud; the sky itself, <pb id="pg-23-150" n="23:150"/>grey, damp, and bitter with smoky foggy Northeast wind, seemed made of mud: men&#x2019;s faces except those of the draymen, had all a look of painful haste and travail, some one or two of a kind of ferocious discontent,&#x2014;which on me operated almost <hi rend="italic">profitably</hi>, as a kind of rebuke: &#x201C;Resemble not these!&#x201D; In St Paul&#x2019;s Churchyard, looking up, as my wont often is, to see the image of a grand soul of a Sir Christopher there, I caught, as my eyes came down again, the lean fanatic visage of Anstey, last seen in Winchester,&#x2014;whom I <hi rend="italic">cut</hi>, not without emotion!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Christopher Wren (<date when="1632">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1723">1723</date>), architect of St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral.

TC had probably fallen out with Anstey because of his strong and even violent support of O&#x2019;Connell; the <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/581"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> refers to him as a &#x201C;malcontent of the highest bore-power.&#x201D;</note> No other known visage did I see till near Chelsea again;&#x2014;neither were these beautiful ones.</p>
<p>If you ever write to Lord Clarendon, will you some time remind him that he must <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, in any wise, send Duffy (were he once convicted) into the herd of common Felons;&#x2014;that in fact nobody in the least believes the <hi rend="italic">Irish</hi> rumour of his meaning to do so. I wrote to him, last week, a long letter on the subject; but forbade any answer. Duffy&#x2019;s attempt at escape, they say, was grounded on this frightful surmise, which is currently rumoured in Dublin, tho&#x2019; I do not believe in it at all. A certain fact is, that Duffy <hi rend="italic">is</hi> intrinsically no &#x201C;felon,&#x201D; more than I am; but on the contrary a good and even genial man, and, so far as I can judge, distinctly the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> of that sad company he has got into. Here is the Note from him,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Newgate Jail, Dublin, <date when="1848-10-23">23 Oct.</date></note> which gave rise to that Letter to Lord C<hi rend="italic">n;</hi>&#x2014;but please do not shew that to any one except Lord Ash<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, for it is of a shrill exasperated nature, and does the poor man no justice, exhibiting him in a mixed mood of panic and rage, <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> both of them, tho&#x2019; not inexcusable.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;Individuality of the Individual&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maccall&#x2019;s lecture.</note> will not do much for you: nevertheless read it, that you may know the man again on occasion.

A man really of considerable faculty; brave enough; cheerful too, tho&#x2019; with a large fund of spleen in him: poor soul, if I were a miniature <hi rend="italic">Providence</hi> in this world, I would not quite see him strangled yet for a while!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It is a quite affecting thing to me to hear of my poor Mother bundling off to Annan, in the cold weather, to seek me a Dressing gown! However, I will not quarrel with it, since it has turned out so well for her: if she have got no hurt by the errand, I know she will in her good heart get a great deal of benefit by it.&#x2014; With respect to the making of the garment, I wish Garthwaite to be rather <hi rend="italic">lucky</hi> [full] in his measures generally, to let the thing come down to the very ancles, and wrap amply round one,&#x2014;the last he made me was a little <hi rend="italic">scrimp</hi> [scanty] both ways (2 inches more in <hi rend="italic">length</hi> for one thing will be an improvement), and being very thin and fully lined, was always an ineffectual garment. As to lining,&#x2014;the gown I have on, which was made by Sampson,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Sampson, tailor and draper, 2 Princes St., Leicester Sq.</note> is lined throughout and down to the very base with this stuff, a worn specimen of which I have just <hi rend="italic">clipt out</hi>, and here send you: sleeves and all are lined with this; it was very warm once, but is grown a little thinnish now. It seems to be some kind of woollen drugget; I of course care nothing about having the <hi rend="italic">same kind</hi> of lining; any equivalent texture, and dim colour, will suit equally well. And if the sleeves <hi rend="italic">have</hi> flannel, or some <hi rend="italic">warmer</hi> lining than the rest, that will be no evil, I suppose.&#x2014; With these pregnant hints, Tom<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Garthwaite.</note> and you must manage it;&#x2014;and &#x2019;ware, both of you, of making a mess of the thing! As I reserve to myself the important privilege of <hi rend="italic">grumbling</hi>, nobody knows when you will hear the end of it!</p>
 <p>Today I send <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> for my Mother; I fear she will find but little in it, so low runs the water there at present. I write duly, myself; but to little <pb id="pg-23-152" n="23:152"/>purpose, or hitherto almost none. Persist!&#x2014; We have no news, except of bad weather here: I have got all my shoes done with <hi rend="italic">gutta-percha</hi> (pronounce, <hi rend="italic">pert</hi>cha!), and absolutely can defy the damp on that side; a real improvement in such mud.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter and Present give me great pleasure, both on my own account and on yours. On my own, because you might easily enough have got into a surly humour with me under those circumstances; on yours still more, because I draw the best auguries for you from this brave face you offer. If you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> learn and unlearn till you loyally suit yourself to the essential demand of this world and this universe,&#x2014;which essential demand is more or less approximately expressed (tho&#x2019; often in a very obscure and crabbed manner, hardly decipherable!) by every thing and by every person you fall in with in the market of life,&#x2014;there is no doubt at all but you may do a good feat yet, and earn wages in all kinds far beyond what you claim or intrinsically need. To <hi rend="italic">humble</hi> &#x201C;the Individuality of the Individual,&#x201D; and with courageous all-endurance lie <hi rend="italic">open</hi> to light whencesoever coming: this is a prime duty of duties; this is an immense achievement;&#x2014;every blockhead, and every contradictory platitude, becomes a man&#x2019;s schoolmaster, and <hi rend="italic">teaches</hi> him till he do learn, in in<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> this happy case!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am very anxious to hear that you have entered on the Lecture speculation, and what outlooks you have. If Northampton accept, try Northampton: if not, let us attempt, what can hardly be impossible, to find another free-stage. Cast <hi rend="italic">all</hi> &#x201C;abstractions&#x201D; to the rear of you; take up such <hi rend="italic">concrete</hi>, coloured, living subject as you think may fairly claim to interest poor concrete human creatures and workers such as you have known, take the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> you have of such subjects; elaborate it with all your might, and with a single eye towards that result of getting men to listen to it;&#x2014;all else will follow out of this first condition; nothing, as you well see, will follow <hi rend="italic">without</hi> this! I believe the rule is, Never to mind your <hi rend="italic">phraseology;</hi> keep the <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> you wish to communicate blazing in your head, the words will come of their own accord, and be on the whole your best words. And set about the matter straightway, if I may advise; nothing seems to me nearly so feasible for you, as matters stand.</p>
<p>So soon as anything is settled, let me hear from you again;&#x2014;or what will be better, come down, for example, on Sunday afternoon next,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Mon.</note> at 5 o&#x2019;clock (precise); take a mutton-chop with us, and tell us what the news are.</p>

<p><salute>Dear <hi rend="italic">Madam</hi> (for I catch the <hi rend="italic">treble</hi> of that fine melodious voice very well),&#x2014;</salute>We have read your Book here, my Wife first and then I; both of us with real pleasure. A beautiful, cheerfully pious, social, clear and observant character is everywhere recogniseable in the writer, which surely is the welcomest sight any writer can shew us in his books; your field moreover is new, important, full of rich materials (which, as is usual, required a soul of some <hi rend="italic">opulence</hi> to recognise them as rich): the result is a Book seeming to take its place far above the ordinary garbage of Novels,&#x2014;a Book which every intelligent person may read with entertainment, and which it will do every one some good to read. I gratefully accept it as a real contribution (almost the first real one) towards developing a huge subject, which has lain <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> too long, and really ought to speak for itself, and tell us its meaning a little, if there be any voice in it at all! Speech, or Literature (which is, or should be, Select-Speech) could hardly find a more rational function, I think, at present.</p>
<p>You will probably give us other Books on this same matter; for I see you are still young;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Mary Barton</hi> had been anonymously sent to TC, to whom it was markedly indebted. Elizabeth Gaskell wrote to Edward Chapman, <date when="1848-12-05">5 Dec.</date>, of this response that &#x201C;Mr Carlyle&#x2019;s letter has been most valuable; and has given me almost the only unmixed pleasure I have yet received from the publication of MB&#x201D;; and again, <date when="1848-12-07">7 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I do indeed value Mr Carlyle&#x2019;s note, and for the precise reason you mention; it bears the stamp of honesty and truth; in the discriminate praise; and shows that he thinks me worthy of being told of my faults&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Letters of Mrs Gaskell</hi>, ed.

May you do it well and ever better! Unless I mistake, you are capable of going still deeper into this subject, and of bringing up Portraits of Manchester Existence still more strikingly <hi rend="italic">real</hi>,&#x2014;which latter quality is the grand value of them in the end.&#x2014; Your writing is already very beautiful, soft, clear, and natural:&#x2014;only learn ever more (what perhaps you can, and what very few can under present conditions) to be <hi rend="italic">concise;</hi> I mean not in words only, but in thought and conception; to reject the <hi rend="italic">un</hi>essential more and more, and retain only the essential, at whatever cost of sacrifice:&#x2014;this, well understood, is really the Law and the Prophets<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 22:40.</note> for a writer! Very fit that a good Book, or any other product that is to endure, have the <hi rend="italic">water</hi> carefully roasted out of it, <pb id="pg-23-155" n="23:155"/>in the first place Jem Wilson,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A young engineer who loves Mary Barton.</note> too, knows very well that one should <hi rend="italic">hit the nail on the head</hi>, always; and having riveted it home, go to the next nail, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> beating on the intermediate spaces,&#x2014;if we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> smiths. In short, brevity and clear veracity,&#x2014;those two, which make properly but <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, are &#x201C;the soul of wit,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 2.2.</note>&#x2014;the essence of all good qualities in writing. On the side of &#x201C;veracity,&#x201D; or devout earnestness of mind, I find you already strong; and that will tend well to help the other side of the matter if there be any defect there.</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Aird</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>I have received your volume of poems:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Poetical Works of Thomas Aird</hi> (<date when="1848">1848</date>).</note> many thanks to you for so kind and worthy a gift, and for the kind and excellent letter which came to me the day after. I have already made considerable inroads into the &#x2018;Tragedy of Wold,&#x2019; and other pieces: I find everywhere a healthy breath as of mountain breezes; a native manliness, veracity, and geniality which, though the poetic form, as you may know, is less acceptable to me in these sad times than the plain prose one, is for ever welcome in all &#x2018;forms&#x2019; and is, withal, so rare just now as to be doubly and trebly precious. But your delineations of reality and fact are so fresh, clear, and genuine when I have met you in that field, that I always grudge to see such a man employ himself in fiction and imagination,&#x2014;when the &#x2018;reality,&#x2019; however real, has to suffer so many abatements before it can come to me. Reality, very ugly and ungainly often, is nevertheless, as I say always, <hi rend="italic">God&#x2019;s</hi> unwritten poem, which it needs precisely that a human genius should <hi rend="italic">write</hi> and make <hi rend="italic">intelligible</hi> (for it would then be beautiful, divine, and have all high and highest qualities) to his less-gifted brothers!

<p>Your new lodging, commanding a view of Troqueer and the river, must be a welcome improvement on the former, which was of the street streetish: the very sound of the <hi rend="italic">Cauld</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A weir across the Nith.</note> is a grateful song to one&#x2019;s heart; whispering of rusticities and actualities; singing a kind of lullaby to all follies and evil and fantastic thoughts in one!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Whether Jack wrote to you yesterday or not, I do not know; but it will be very proper that I write to you today, and make sure. He came, all safe, two nights ago; and just at the right time; for Jane, who had caught some cold or other mischief the day before, was considerably out of order that night, and he by some little pill procured her a good sleep, and has quite <pb id="pg-23-157" n="23:157"/>set her up again.&#x2014; His news, about Scotsbrig and you and all the rest, you may suppose were interesting to us! You are not strong, he admits; but he thinks you will be decidedly better with these new medicines and arrangements of his;&#x2014;no doubt he would settle for you and arrange whatever little good he could; and if there were anything else any of us could do, surely it would be our best happiness to get it done! I am far away from you; and, alas, I can do simply nothing at all!&#x2014; He made us merry last night with the account of that &#x201C;flatsoled hero-worshipper,&#x201D; Hyslop and your reception of him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> &#x201C;The Mother of Thomas Carlyle?&#x201C;&#x2014;Yes.&#x2014;&#x201C;Born where?&#x201D; Ecclefechan:&#x2014;he said no fastidious Duchess could have done the poor Blockhead better than you by the simple force of Nature, dispiritment of mood, and practical desire to get rid of idle babble, and be left at rest. Such people often enough come staggering about us here; and require to be managed in somewhat the same way. We tried to guess who this Hyslop could be; but were not able at all. A Blacketrig man,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 mi. E of Middlebie.</note>&#x2014;or from the Moffat region? Perhaps Jamie knows.</p>
<p>Enclosed here is a small Gift for you, dear Mother, which Jamie (for it is marked in his name) may change into ten bits of Notes,&#x2014;next Wednesday or the day before. You are to give Isabella two sovereigns, and each of the three <foreign>bairns</foreign> half a sovereign; what remains I wish you to <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> something with, for yourself,&#x2014;something, anything that you care about, as the need turns up: and say, &#x201C;Tom gave it me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tell Jamie to be very careful about his health. That is an ugly complaint of his;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1848-08-17">17 Sept.</date>, that &#x201C;some kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">fistula</hi></foreign> may already be formed, but it cannot be of the worst sort.&#x201D;</note> and depends <hi rend="italic">very much</hi> on the way one treats it, on the care one takes of it. C. Buller is confined just now with a surgical operation for that very thing,&#x2014;a severer form of it than Jamie&#x2019;s&#x2014; Tell Isabella we have broken into the Butter, and find it excellent as formerly. The very <hi rend="italic">top</hi> surface &#x201C;tasted of the wood&#x201D; a little, Jane said; but now that is quite away. The meal is unsurpassable. Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Sterling will pay me, I fancy, soon; then I will repay for his stock.</p>
<p>But what shall I say of the Dressing gown? Jane admits, it is the bonniest I ever had at any time: warm, light, fine, and pretty to look upon; and (tell poor Garthwaite too) it fits every way to perfection. Thanks to you all. Thanks to my dear old Mother, who determined to achieve this for me still; and has achieved it. Surely as I sit wrapped in that kind caring, I shall think often and lovingly of her, and of all her faithful endeavours for me early and late. My time for going out is quite past; I must end today. A word from some of you soon. <closer><salute>Ever your son&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Goethe Genealogy.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote a note, <date when="1848-11-25">25 Nov.</date>, evidently elaborating on the genealogy referred to here: &#x201C;Goethes Grand-father <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a tailor.&#x2014; / Hans Christian Goethe, blacksmith at Artern &#x2026; in Saxony had a son, Frederic George (born <date when="1657">1657</date>), who duly served his &#x2018;years of apprenticeship&#x2019; as an aspiring tailor.&#x2014; During his &#x2018;years of wandering&#x2019; he came to Frankfort, where he settled and was admitted a &#x2018;burgher&#x2019; and master-tailor; and married (<date when="1687">1687</date>) the Jungfrau Anna Elisabetha, daughter of Sebastian Lutz, citizen and master-tailor. / His wife, it appears, died early, and he married a second time; the Frau Cornelia Schelhorn, a rich widow, and landlady of the &#x2018;Weidenhof&#x2019; hotel. He gave up the tailor-business and became &#x2018;mine host&#x2019; of this inn. With this second wife, Cornelia, he had, amongst other children, a son, Johann Caspar (born <date when="1710">1710</date>) the Poet&#x2019;s father.&#x201D;</note> I suppose we must keep it among our &#x201C;family secrets,&#x201D; not to be lightly disclosed to the profane world,&#x2014;at least not till it can assist in that grand cause, the &#x201C;Emancipation of Tailors,&#x201D; which, far more than Negro or any other Emancipation, is to mark the final triumph of Liberty in this Planet! Surely in the History of Tailors there is no grander fact than this of the poor <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schneider-Bursch</hi></foreign> [tailor&#x2019;s apprentice] entering Frankfort Gates, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schlagbaum</hi></foreign> [turnpike] perhaps stingily lifted; and such an Olympian Product lying dormant in him! But the world is full of such histories, if we knew them.</p>
<p>When you come next to Chelsea, you will tell me who your Authority is,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Neuberg&#x2019;s note of <date when="1848-11-25">25 Nov.</date>, TC wrote: &#x201C;Viehoff (Goethe&#x2019;s Leben [3 pts., Stuttgart, 1847&#x2013;49]) is the authority for these details. / (2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> letter from Neuberg <date when="1848-12-15">15 dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1848</date>).&#x201D;</note> and where his very orderly information comes from; so that the record may go its farther journeys in an authentic shape. The name of the H&#xF4;tel too would be better for a slight elucidation,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I think it must be &#x201C;Wei<hi rend="italic">d</hi>enhof&#x201D;?&#x2014; &#x2014; This done we will put your paper among the Archives.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC kept the information inside an envelope (PM: <date when="1848-11-22">22 Nov.</date>) addressed to him by Neuberg on which he wrote &#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Genealogy.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>His Majesty of Prussia seems to have taken the mad bull by the horns.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1848-11-12">12 Nov.</date>, Berlin was said to be in a state of siege; the king dissolved the Burgher Guard; and against the resolve of the Prussian national assembly, King Frederick William IV also dissolved it.</note> I hope there is Hohenzollern blood enough in the heart of him, for persistence to the death in that bold stroke of policy! He ought really to achieve that, or else to die: other manful course I can see none for him. Democracy bridled,&#x2014;and the things <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, wisely, valiantly, justly, which Democracy was blindly and insanely striving for;&#x2014;if so much (which indeed is a great deal) do lie in the King and his Forces, he may play a grand part in Germany yet. But alas, alas&#x2014;!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-23-159" n="23:159"/>Have you anything to do with <hi rend="italic">Mechanics&#x2019; Institutes</hi>, or the like class of objects, about Nottingham?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg was pres. of the literary dept. of the Nottingham Mechanics&#x2019; Inst.</note> I have fallen in with a man here called Maccall, an <hi rend="italic">Ex-unitarian</hi> of considerable faculties, of high aim, and in a very untowardly position, who might perhaps be worth your notice some day, on that or other grounds.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many kind regards, and the hope to see you before long.</salute></closer></p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Seneca</hi> is not in the least a scarce book: on the contrary there have been sixteen editions; and I found two copies of it in the Old-Book-shop where I was, one at half-a-crown, the other at 3 shillings! I resolved to lay out the additional sixpence,&#x2014;considering you worthy of that venture. A respectable grey old book, in legible print, with dim old yellow Calf-binding; has <hi rend="italic">prints</hi> too, wood-cuts of certain of the Virtues &#x26;c, to assist the infant comprehension. Surely we shall get some seeds of morality sown in you at last; and that strong soil will not run always to waste! Two shillings more (for it is beyond a pound weight) will bring you the invaluable Treatise by post, if you want it, and will risk the binding. At all events it here humbly awaits your Ladyship&#x2019;s commands;&#x2014;much obliged by the Commission, and hope your Ladyship will honour us again, and ever <hi rend="italic">again</hi>&#x2014; Ah me!</p>
<p>Jane is quite well again; I suppose she will answer your letter soon. Yesterday she went a second time to Lady Sandwich&#x2019;s;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s house, 47 Grosvenor Pl.</note> to whom she seems to take, which I am very glad of: her report was pretty good of the poor Patient, to whom company and cheerful conversation are, as you say, the chief remedies that avail. Jane found her quite lively, and very entertaining, especially after they had got under way a little, and brought the fuel into flame.&#x2014; The Miss Farrars also were here one day;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Annie Louisa and Mary (d. <date when="1908">1908</date>) Farrer.</note> but found only me, in Cheyne <hi rend="italic">Walk;</hi> and, after looking at the door to know it again, went on their way.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am glad you intend setting forth your ideas on the frightful subject of <pb id="pg-23-162" n="23:162"/>Pauperism, a subject which naturally engages the thoughts of all thinking men in these times; and certainly if I had any statistic or other information that promised to further you, I would with pleasure send it. But that is not the case; nor indeed, according to my calculation, could it well be. First and last, I have looked into various statistic books and records, but these hitherto have not been a source of much knowledge to me on the matter; and in these, at any rate, I suppose you to be already infinitely richer than I. Knowledge on this subject, and indeed on any subject, I have generally found, is only to be had by the exercise of observation on it in the concrete shape, and not from statistics,&#x2014;which, in order to be worth much, require to <hi rend="italic">follow</hi> and to confirm and modify convictions, not to precede, or pretend to create them. Following in this way in the rear, they <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be select and appropriate, and may become as an invincible drilled army for one&#x2019;s object; preceding, in the usual fashion, they are a huge <hi rend="italic">canaille</hi>, consisting of fit and unfit, and oftenest serve only to encumber, or even to smother and destroy! I will trouble you with nothing of that sort, on the present occasion, even if I had it in plenty.</p>
<p>My native region, Annandale, Dumfriesshire, on the Scotch Border, which is so unfortunate as to lie on the road from Donaghadee in Ireland<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seaport in Co. Down, ca. 16 mi. NE of Belfast.</note> towards the rich parts, north and south, of this Island, has from of old forced on me the tragic spectacle of a brave, industrious, religious, excellent and happy Peasantry reduced, within 30 years that I have known it, gradually to a condition below endurance (tho&#x2019; the poor people do yet continue to endure it); and has given rise to innumerable reflexions in me. Beggary, vice, and every species of human degradation steadily increasing in the lower orders, and in the higher every species of human <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi>, levity and contemptibility, along with the new increase of rent, and what is called &#x201C;improvement&#x201D; by Customhouse Philosophers (and is so, to a certain degree, in a certain small sense): all this was of a nature to give rise to reflexions! Influx of scandalous hordes of ragged Irishmen,&#x2014;as indeed not only there, but now everywhere, and on the streets of London itself, may be observed,&#x2014;has been the palpable proximate cause of most of that misery: but, alas, I can perceive withal it is &#x201C;proximate&#x201D; only, and indeed is not so much itself a &#x201C;cause,&#x201D; as the symptom and general outcome of many sad causes. Causes innumerable, deep-seated, wide-spread, engrained into the very blood of us; most difficult to be cast out (&#x201C;impossible&#x201D; is the word),&#x2014;and which must be cast out, or social death itself, in the shape of &#x201C;Red Republic&#x201D; and bottomless ruin and delirium, seems not to be far off!</p>
<p>My own private conclusion, which as yet I can get very few to agree in, is <pb id="pg-23-163" n="23:163"/>that the Government (even that distracted Talking Phantasm presided over by the like of Lord John Russell, which we at present call Government) ought to close its sublime Scriptures of Political Economy, with all their unutterable Talmuds, and looking at the bare fact,&#x2014;which is plain enough without hand-lanterns, and will soon grow to an explosive business effectually superseding <hi rend="italic">lanterns</hi>,&#x2014;say to itself, &#x201C;I must either find employment for these hungry masses, or they and I must perish. I am no Government otherwise, but a noisy insane Coil of red tape and Palaver, disowned of gods and men!&#x201D;</p>
<p>What immediate novelties, what <hi rend="italic">infinitude</hi> of slow changes are involved in such an enterprise, I perceive too well. But it seems to me, either they or else ruin have become inevitable <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>,&#x2014;and that the years and even the months that now pass are priceless! I have the firmest conviction that it is possible for even an actual Government (with one brave man in the heart of it), to begin <hi rend="italic">enlisting</hi> mad perishing mobs of unemployed Paupers into &#x201C;Industrial Regiments,&#x201D; and under strict military drill, <hi rend="italic">just</hi> as Rhadamanthus, and wise, and stern as he, to <hi rend="italic">find</hi> employment for them, in colonies, in Bogs of Allen,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rhadamanthus (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431025-JWC-JW-01"><sic>17:158</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-10-25">25 Oct. 1843</date></corr></ref>). The Bogs of Allen are a series of peat bogs in cent. Ireland, extending from ca. 17 mi. W of Dublin almost to the Shannon; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370222-TC-JSM-01"><sic>9:156</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1837-02-22">22 Feb. 1837</date></corr></ref>, where unidentified.</note> in hundreds of square miles of waste improvable land (now first become important by railways) which I myself have travelled over; and on the whole, to get sufficient work out of them for their own subsistence;&#x2014;and so set the whole world on the right track in this matter. By <hi rend="italic">persisting</hi> in which, widening cautiously their field of operations, improving, gradually perfecting their methods,&#x2014;the enormous Problem, if achievable (which we at no moment doubt), may be achieved; and, in the course of long, <hi rend="italic">faithful</hi> centuries, Society from basis to top, may be purged of its Unveracities to a moderate extent, and actually what they call &#x201C;remodelled,&#x201D; with nothing but <hi rend="italic">real</hi> commanders, and no quack commander (either clerical or lay), <hi rend="italic">openly</hi> venturing to shew himself in it! What a Problem that is, I have some notion. But to see even the beginning of it were a blessing unspeakable. Alas, even to begin it, we need, even according to my hypothesis, &#x201C;one brave man&#x201D; in the Realm of Red tape;&#x2014;and where <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is to be got is perhaps not so very clear at present!</p>
<p>I often tell my friend Mr Buller* (who is very patient with me), the &#x201C;Organization of Labour&#x201D; is an actual inevitability in every country,&#x2014;and must be taken up not <foreign>&#xE0; la</foreign> Louis Blanc, but in precisely the opposite manner (by military <hi rend="italic">command</hi> namely, and death-penalty if needful);&#x2014;and that he, Mr Buller, he of all men, with some six annual millions in his <pb id="pg-23-164" n="23:164"/>pocket,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As chief commissioner of the poor law.</note> and a Horseguards and Sovereign Power to back him in the necessary drill exercise, is the man to begin it!</p>

<p>Alas, alas, what sad tragedy is this,&#x2014;the saddest, I think, that ever befel among friends of mine!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The death of Charles Buller.</note> &#x201C;Five minutes to six&#x201C;: about the very moment I awoke, this morning, with the thought of him painfully blazing in me. And it was all over. And we shall never see that blithe face more; for the rest of our pilgrimage, never more!&#x2014;</p>
 <p>That Monday you went away, the last time I saw him, he was unusually cheerful; spoke of his operation for the morrow as a thing of no significance, like the mere drawing of a tooth or less; and invited me to come and talk with him &#x201C;next Wednesday.&#x201C;&#x2014; I privately believe, it is the <hi rend="italic">chloroform</hi> that has done it:&#x2014;but, alas, of what moment is that now?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to the <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3913"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>, he had an operation that brought on erysipelas, which was followed by typhus; it was the result of unskillful surgery. In his Journal, <date when="1848-12-04">4 Dec.</date>, TC wrote: &#x201C;Charles Buller died on Wednesday morning last (<date when="1848-11-29">29 Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>); some surgical operation (for a species of <hi rend="italic">fistula</hi>, but not considered of any danger) was done under <hi rend="italic">chloroform</hi>, this day three weeks,&#x2014;after which his strength never rallied, &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">typhus</hi>&#x2019; fever supervened (such was their name for it), and rapidly the last end came. A great deal of painful agitation in our circle ever since. A small word upon him in yesterday&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> (no copy preserved) accurately enough expressed my feelings;&#x2014;so far as any clear feeling can get itself asserted in me hitherto, in the middle of those sorry bewilderments, ostentation, and insane noises which check all feeling in one! The whole life of poor Buller, since I first walked with him six and twenty years ago round the root of Salisbury Crags at Edinburgh, masses itself in a strange tragic heap before me,&#x2014;all my reminiscences of him crowded into one. He was a friendly presence to me in this world; not a friend, in any intimate or practical sense. A gifted brilliant creature in many respects;&#x2014;he has vanished now; hidden, it may be mercifully, from evil days that might have awaited him, from a lot he could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have shone so well in! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign>&#x2014; Tomorrow is the funeral; where I have to be.&#x2014; Work today is not; alas, alas!&#x2014;!&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s piece on Buller appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-12-02">2 Dec.</date>; rptd. Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 2:36&#x2013;41, <hi rend="italic">Rescued Essays</hi> 117&#x2013;25. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-12-02">2 Dec.</date> (abridging the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, <date when="1848-11-30">30 Nov.</date>, to which Buller had contributed), emphasizes his radicalism and says that his reputation rested less on &#x201C;any specific course of political action, as upon his peculiar talents as a speaker, and latterly as an administrative officer. Mr. Buller was always theoretically in advance even of that liberal section of the liberal party to which he might be said to belong. &#x2026; Whatever question he might take up, it was almost certain that he would present an original view of it, or, if that were impossible, such an admirable summing up and exposition of the whole case, that those who did not like his argument were staggered by his facts. &#x2026; Another characteristic &#x2026; was the humorous turn he gave even to the gravest subjects. &#x2026; Altogether, he was a very clever, very amiable, and very valuable man, and &#x2026; his loss at this particular period will be felt far beyond the circle of his party and his friends.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-23-165" n="23:165"/>To all of us his death is a sore loss; not to any living creature, I think, could it seem a <hi rend="italic">gain:</hi> for his presence was cheering and beneficent to all, and hurtful or afflictive to none that lived. But to you, dear Friend,&#x2014;alas, it is a loss which I fear none of us can ever repair! In his own form he was by far the brightest soul in your circle; or indeed in all the world, that I know of. A great blank indeed to you; and who can console you?&#x2014; For himself it is perhaps happy: he passes away in the flower of his years, with the love of all the world following him; had he lived to see old age, perhaps its austerities, sadnesses, and sterner duties might have less suited him. The Eternal Power has willed it <hi rend="italic">so.</hi></p>
<p>I do not forbid you to weep: Nature will have its due; and an immense unexpected loss, one is permitted to bewail it. But you will not indulge in grief; no, you will rouse your better heart to conquer grief, to transform it into heroic determination. For us it is appointed still to <hi rend="italic">live;</hi> and Destiny is striking as with an iron hammer on our hearts to say, &#x201C;Remember to live <hi rend="italic">well!</hi>&#x201D; That is the one way of conquering grief. All pious thoughts be near you, dear Lady!&#x2014;</p>
<p>It was soon after nine when our Messenger returned, this morning; my Wife went off directly after to attend poor Mrs Buller. What in the world will become of that poor bereaved old Mother,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Whose husband had died, <date when="1848-05-17">17 May</date>.</note> already at the point of death! Her calmness yesterday, Jane said, was almost frightful.</p>
<p>Lady Sandwich, whom I saw yesterday, did not seem to me so well as I expected. She was very cheerful, talkative, amid a crowd of people; but her head was sickly, in her voice was some cold;&#x2014;however, I was to &#x201C;report her <hi rend="italic">better</hi>&#x201D;; and perhaps so she is, for I did not see her before.</p>
<p>God be merciful to us all. We ought to be <hi rend="italic">silent;</hi> and accept, with pious submission,&#x2014;with profitable thoughts, unknown in these times,&#x2014;whatever bitter cup is sent us. <closer><salute>May God bless you evermore, dear Lady, and make <hi rend="italic">all</hi> turn to <hi rend="italic">good</hi> for you! That is the prayer of those still left.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>Here is the price of the meal, sent in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> name; no better meal could have come as a specimen to strangers; and Sterling, having a Scotch maid down in the country,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Headley Grove.</note> professes to be enjoying the porridge &#x26;c of it, not a little. Thanks to you for being so punctual and successful in accomplishing one&#x2019;s requests.</p>
<p>This morning we have all had a painful shock: poor Charles Buller, not reckoned to be in danger till within the last two days, is dead! He died this morning &#x201C;at five minutes to six,&#x201C;&#x2014;that was the answer to our messenger: John and I had been at the house last night; and, tho&#x2019; the case was evidently very grave, we did not quite anticipate this end, or at least not so soon. You may fancy it has hurled all my thoughts into a strange confusion, and brought up many a remembrance now grown very sorrowful! Jane hurried off immediately to attend poor Mrs Buller,&#x2014;a poor thin old woman, wasted to a shadow,&#x2014;whom I think <hi rend="italic">this</hi> will be apt to overwhelm altogether! Poor woman, she was at Clifton, 100 miles off in the West, not thought to be able to travel a mile, when hearing of her son&#x2019;s state, she hurried hither; and was sitting yesterday when Jane called in a state of calm collectedness which Jane said was almost frightful. She was not allowed to see him either; nobody was; and to this also she was meekly resigned. Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Buller was about your own age, a thin, tall, loose-made, but active man; and, I think, had some complaint like that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> now labour under. Not quite the same, but one of the same sort, in the same organs of the body. He had undergone two or more operations at different times; and had now (that is, Monday gone a fortnight) to undergo another. I saw him the day before; and he attached no importance to it whatever,&#x2014;having found formerly that, except the momentary pain, it amounted to nothing. This time, unfortunately, he had a new Doctor, and they used the newfangled <hi rend="italic">chloroform:</hi> the operation was of course done <hi rend="italic">without</hi> pain, and it seemed to prosper, and the healing to proceed as well as possible; but his <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> never returned, there was a fever always, and now on the 14th day this is the end of it! Poor Buller, he was one of the clearest, blithest, wittiest and cleverest of all men living; after 20 years toil and confusion in Parliament &#x26;c, he was just beginning to rise into some practical eminence, and reap some fruit of the kind he coveted,&#x2014;and here it all ends! Dear Brother, I cannot write any more today; my thoughts, as you may fancy, are turning all on one subject.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; Some day this week will Isabella or you write me <pb id="pg-23-167" n="23:167"/>a word to say how my Mother is, and that this has come to hand. Here is a cover; and you have only to say (if you can) &#x201C;Well&#x201D; and &#x201C;rec<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Doctor and Jane are both well; our weather is westerly, generally dryish, and very warm, which agrees best with poor thin-skinned people.</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>We received your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1848-10-02">2 Oct.</date></note> duly, some time ago, with many welcomes; and have, as you see, been too remiss in answering it. Not from forgetfulness, if you will take my word; no, but from many causes, too complicated to articulate, and justly producing an indisposition to put pen to paper at all! Never was I more silent than in these very months; and with reason too, for the world at large, and my own share of it in small, are both getting more and more <hi rend="italic">un</hi>speakable with any convenience! In health we of this household are about as well as usual;&#x2014;and look across to the woods of Concord with more light than we had, realising for ourselves a most mild and friendly picture there. Perhaps it is quite as well that you are left alone of foreign interference, even of a letter from Chelsea, till you get your huge bulk of English reminiscences assorted a little. Nobody except me seems to have heard from you; at least the rest, in these parts, all plead destitution when I ask for news. What you saw and suffered and enjoyed here, will, if you had once got it properly warehoused, be new wealth to you for many years. Of one impression we fail not here: admiration of your pacific virtues, of gentle and noble tolerance, often sorely tried in this place! Forgive me my ferocities; you do not quite know what I suffer in those latitudes, or perhaps it would be even easier for you. Peace for me, in a Mother of Dead Dogs<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>You are to be burdened with a foolish bit of business for me again; do not grudge it, but do it since it has come in course! Here is the matter. About three years ago (I think in the end of 1845), Mr Hart, of the Bookselling Firm Carey &#x26; Hart in Philadelphia, sent me, as you may remember, a Draft for &#xa3;50 payable by some house in Liverpool;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brown, Shipley &#x26; Co. Abraham Hart (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885">85</date>), partner in the Philadelphia publishing firm Carey &#x26; Hart; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460102-TC-AHA-01"><sic>20:92</sic><corr>TC to AHA, <date when="1846-01-02">2 Jan. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> it was in return for liberty to print (without grumble from me) the Book of Essays; and tho&#x2019; an old <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> friend in Philadelphia negociated the immediate details,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Henry Furness (<date when="1802">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1896">96</date>), American Unitarian clergyman and abolitionist; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460103-TC-RWE-01"><sic>20:93</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1846-01-03">3 Jan. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> you too I believe had a hand in the affair, and were privy to it all along. Well, this <pb id="pg-23-169" n="23:169"/>Draft arrived; came to me while I was at Alverstoke in Hampshire with Mr Baring (Hon. W. Bingham Baring, now Lord Ashburton) probably about this very season of the year: whether the Liverpool House had <hi rend="italic">accepted</hi> I cannot now say; but their acceptance not being doubtful, the Paper (payable probably in 60 days or so) was of course perfectly equivalent to the sum marked on it; and accordingly Mr Baring, when I spoke of negociating it, and inquired his advice, How? volunteered, <hi rend="italic">as my</hi> only Banker is a Scotch one at Dumfries, to give me at once in return for it a Draft on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Bankers (the Drummonds, of Charing Cross here), by whom the Paper would be duly managed without trouble to any body, and the &#xa3;50 at once paid me. And so undoubtedly the &#xa3;50 was at once paid <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and I got it and spent it, and returned some acknowledgement to Mr Hart for it; and had entirely forgotten it, when about a year ago Mr Baring, surveying his Banker&#x2019;s account-book, told me he could not find that item in it; was by me invited to search farther, has searched farther, set his Bankers to search,&#x2014;and now, the other day, ascertains finally that there is no such payment or transaction recorded in his favour,&#x2014;and that, in brief, he must have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> the Carey-and-Hart Draft for &#xa3;50 payable by some Liverpool House, and that it was never presented for payment, and consequently never paid! This he told me the other night; and I of course, heartily vexed at this act of carelessness, engaged to inquire. The things to be done therefore are two: first to ascertain from Mr Hart what the exact particulars of the Draft were (this will be tolerably easy, I suppose); and then secondly Whether, supposing the money were never demanded it is now in the hands of the Philadelphia or of the Liverpool House, or in whose hands,&#x2014;in short, what is possible for limited but honest human nature, pursuing correctness under impediments, still to do in the matter! Ascertain me these two things, this one last time, like a good fellow:&#x2014;and I will let you lie quiet for a very long time to come!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nay there is another practical question,&#x2014;but it is from the female side of the house to the female side,&#x2014;and in fact concerns Indian meal, upon which Mrs Emerson, or you, or the Miller of Concord (if he have any tincture of philosophy) are now to instruct us! The fact is, potatoes having vanished here, we are again, with motives large and small, trying to learn the use of indian meal; and indeed do eat it daily to meat at dinner, tho&#x2019; hitherto with considerable despair. Question <hi rend="italic">first</hi> therefore: Is there by nature a <hi rend="italic">bitter</hi> final taste, which makes the throat smart, and disheartens much the apprentice in Indian meal;&#x2014;or is it accidental, and to be avoided? We surely anticipate the latter answer; but do not yet see how. At first we were taught the meal, all ground on your side of the water, had got fusty, <hi rend="italic">raw;</hi> an effect we are well used to in oaten and other meals: but, last year, we had a bushel of it ground <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and the bitter taste was there as <pb id="pg-23-170" n="23:170"/>before (with the addition of much dirt and sand, our mill-stones I suppose being too soft);&#x2014;whereupon we incline to surmise that there is perhaps, as in the case of oats, some pellicle or hull that ought to be <hi rend="italic">rejected</hi> in making the meal? Pray ask some philosophic Miller, if Mrs E. or you do not know;&#x2014;and as a corollary this <hi rend="italic">second</hi> question: What is the essential difference between <hi rend="italic">white</hi> (or brown-grey-white) Indian meal, and <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> (the kind we now have; beautiful as new guineas, but with an ineffaceable tastekin of <hi rend="italic">soot</hi> in it)?&#x2014; And question 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, which includes all: How to cook <hi rend="italic">mush</hi> rightly, at least without bitter? <hi rend="italic">Long</hi>-continued boiling seems to help the bitterness, but does not cure it. Let some oracle speak! I tell all people, our staff of life is in the Mississippi Valley henceforth;&#x2014;and one of the truest benefactors were an American Minerva<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Roman goddess of wisdom and patroness of the arts and trades.</note> who could teach us to cook this meal; which our people, at present (I included) are unanimous in finding nigh uneatable; and loudly exclaimable against! Elihu Burrit<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elihu Burritt (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879">79</date>), American linguist and advocate of international peace; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461218-TC-RWE-01"><sic>21:114</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1846-12-18">18 Dec. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> had a string of recipes that went thro&#x2019; all newspapers three years ago; but never sang there oracle of longer ears than that,&#x2014;totally destitute of practical significance to any creature here!</p>
<p>And now enough of questioning. Alas, alas, I have a quite other patch of sad and saddest considerations,&#x2014;on which I must not so much as enter at present! Death has been very busy in this little circle of ours, within these few days. You remember Charles Buller, to whom I brought you over, that night, at the Barings&#x2019; in Stanhope Street?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Notebook, Emerson recorded: &#x201C;At Lady Harriet Baring&#x2019;s dinner [<date when="1848-03-23">23 March</date>], Carlyle &#x26; Milnes introduced me to Charles Buller, &#x2018;reckoned&#x2019; they said aloud, &#x2018;the cleverest man in England&#x2019;&#x2014;&#x2018;until,&#x2019; added Milnes, &#x2018;until he meddled with affairs&#x2019;:&#x2014; For Buller was now Poor-Laws Commissioner &#x26; had really postponed hitherto to make good the extraordinary expectation which his speeches in Parliament had created&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks</hi> 10:533). See also Emerson&#x2019;s account of Buller in the letter to his wife, <date when="1848-03-23">23</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-03-24">24 March</date> (Rusk 4:43).</note> He died this day week, almost quite unexpectedly; a sore loss to all that knew him personally, and his gladdening sunny presence in many circles here; a sore loss to the political people too, for he was far the cleverest of all Whig men, and indeed the only genial soul one can remember in that department of things. We buried him yesterday; and now see what new thing has come. Lord Ashburton, who had left his mother well in Hampshire ten hours before, is summoned from poor Buller&#x2019;s funeral by telegraph; hurries back, finds his mother, whom he loved much, already dead! She was a Miss Bingham, I think, from Pennsylvania, perhaps from Philadelphia itself.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne Louisa, Dowager Lady Ashburton, d. at Stoke, Hampshire, <date when="1848-12-05">5 Dec.</date> She was the eldest da. of Senator William Bingham of Philadelphia.</note> You saw her;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the dinner at Lady Harriet&#x2019;s, <date when="1848-03-23">23 March.</date></note> <pb id="pg-23-171" n="23:171"/>but the first sight by no means told one all or the best worth that was in that good lady. We are quite bewildered by our own regrets and by the far painfuller sorrow of those closely related to these sudden sorrows. Of which let me be silent for the present;&#x2014;and indeed of all things else, for <hi rend="italic">speech</hi>, inadequate mockery of one&#x2019;s poor meaning, is quite a burden to me just now!</p>
<p>Neuberg comes hither sometimes; a welcome, wise kind of man. Poor little Espinasse still toils cheerily at the oar; and various friends of yours are about us. Brother John did send thro&#x2019; Chapman all the <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>, which we calculate you have received long ago: he is now come to Town; doing a Preface &#x26;c, which also will be sent to you, and is just about publishing&#x2014;Helps, who has been alarmingly ill, and touring on the Rhine, since we were his guests, writes to me yesterday from Hampshire about sending you a new Book of his.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For their visit to Helps, see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480707-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1848-07-07">7 July</date></ref>.

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter from Alick; which has been at Scotsbrig, and opened there, where it was immensely longed for; being now read here, I forward it to Dumfries without delay. Alick ought to send our Mother a <hi rend="italic">Newspaper</hi> weekly; that would be the far best method: I think I must write to him today, recommending that.</p>
<p>We never understood till last night, when the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> Newspaper came,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Standard</hi>.</note> that there was any dangerous epidemic of cholera at Dumfries:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1848-12-05">5 Dec.</date>, reported that cholera had been &#x201C;very severe&#x201D; in Dumfries for the past week. The number of cases since its outbreak was 180, of which sixty-five were fatal.</note> the disease has been here for many weeks, but is in the highest degree insignificant, and except for the talk made of it in the Newspapers, would never be heard of. A Note of yours to my Mother had given us a somewhat similar impression about Dumfries; but here are two new Letters of yours, <pb id="pg-23-172" n="23:172"/>this morning, one to Isabella, one to John, which disclose to us a very different state of matters! The most comforting circumstance we can hitherto gather is, that you do not seem to be thrown into panic by it: <hi rend="italic">panic</hi>, nobody doubts, is an immense aggravation to the danger; and it really would be wise if Doctors, who can do so very little towards defence against the malady, would at least carefully forbear agitating people&#x2019;s minds about it. That of the &#x201C;hearses&#x201D; in your street, for example, I consider to be a real crime against the public.&#x2014; Keep up your hearts, do calmly your duties as if there were no cholera there,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">death</hi> is always and has always been there; and we shall not die a moment before our time, were a hundred choleras there!&#x2014; &#x2014; Our Doctors say, great things can be done, and the disease is <hi rend="italic">generally</hi> curable, if you can take it at the very first. Here are a dozen <hi rend="italic">cholera pills</hi> which were advised upon us here;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Dr. Southwood Smith via Forster; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18481018-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1848-10-18">18 Oct.</date></ref></note> I know they are at least entirely harmless, and must have a tendency in the right direction: feeling properly, any tendency to purge, oftenest <hi rend="italic">without</hi> pain any twinge of cholic or griping in the bowels, one has to swallow one of these,&#x2014;or a drop of sound brandy, or anything that you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> will tend to check that affair; if at once checked, all is understood to be safe again. I stick in the poor little box: no <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> in it, if little good! And pray let us hear <hi rend="italic">constantly</hi>, one word and a penny stamp will be well bestowed for a few days. And God be with you all, and the brave and pious heart which is His best gift in all dangers and trials!</p>
<p>Charles Buller is dead suddenly; there have been many deaths in our circle here lately: we are still all well. <closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>You can have no idea what a relief your Letter has been to our poor Mother! For many weeks past she has been fretting and mourning about the want of any tidings from you, and forecasting (as you know her habit) every form of evil. Do not expose her to the like again, if you can possibly help it! Jack suggests that you should get a Brantford Paper for that express purpose; he has twice mentioned it to you, he says; and now urges me to persuade you in the like direction. I really think it would be by far the wisest plan. The expense of a Weekly Paper, I suppose, is trifling; at any rate, I, or any of us here, would gladly pay it (if that were all!) to avoid <pb id="pg-23-173" n="23:173"/>such anxieties to one now so weak and still so kind!&#x2014; Dear Brother, let me request of you to do this thing, unless there be difficulties in it which I do not see. If you care <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> about reading the Brantford Paper or any other in the Province, then let it become <hi rend="italic">a fixed habit</hi> with you to buy one <hi rend="italic">once a fortnight</hi>, and to direct it to our Mother at Scotsbrig, and punctually despatch it. Do this, and we will all thank you. &#x201C;Once a fortnight&#x201C;: I will write to Scotsbrig that they may by and by expect such a messenger with regularity like that of a clock:&#x2014;and hereby I request my Nephew Tom and my Niece &#x201C;little Jane,&#x201D; and all persons in the house who care for me, to be aiding and assisting to you in this pious enterprise,&#x2014;and to look after it themselves if you at any time forget for a day! And so enough.</p>
<p>All is well hitherto in Annandale and here, so far as health and outward things go. Jack returned a fortnight or more ago; bringing a very tolerable report of our good old Mother&#x2019;s situation; busy &#x201C;reading&#x201D; &#x26;c, and pretty well,&#x2014;except for her anxieties about <hi rend="italic">Bield</hi> far off! Jamie&#x2019;s crops were good; his health too, which had been in some disturbance (from <hi rend="italic">local</hi> bilious causes, I believe) had improved much under the Doctor&#x2019;s treatment. We had Letters <hi rend="italic">this morning</hi> from Dumfries and from Scotsbrig: all well still, at both places,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; at Dumfries the cholera had been rather alarming for a few days, and was not quite subsided yet. The disease is everywhere in this country just now; but except at Dumfries I hear of no place where it is not of the last degree of insignificance, not worth noising about as a specific disease.&#x2014; Jack&#x2019;s Book is just coming out at last: a terrible <foreign>peghing</foreign> [panting] job with it he has had, poor fellow! He is very well; and considerably <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> (in composure &#x26;c) by his labour.</p>
<p>No potatoes here, this year, that a man of <hi rend="italic">taste</hi> in that matter can eat! We have taken to Indian Meal; make a kind of <hi rend="italic">mush</hi> of it, to eat with flesh mea<supplied>[t]</supplied> at dinner. It has a villainous bitter <hi rend="italic">took</hi> [nasty taste] at the end of it, as if a grain of <hi rend="italic">soot</hi> were secretly mixed in it,&#x2014;or as if the meal itself had got fusty, <hi rend="italic">raw:</hi> I could eat it very well otherwise;&#x2014;and this <hi rend="italic">took</hi> I continue to believe <hi rend="italic">accidental</hi> in some way. Americans have told us it is too long kept; but that is not quite the reason, for we had a bushel done here from <hi rend="italic">corn</hi>, and it had the same bitterness, besides a great quantity of <hi rend="italic">sand</hi> (our Millstones here being too soft, I suppose). Is there any <hi rend="italic">dust</hi> in it perhaps, as in oats? I some times think that may be the reason. Or what is the difference between the <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> meal (yellow, and beautiful as new guineas) and the <hi rend="italic">white</hi> (greyish white, with a touch of brown)? I believe we ought all to <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> forthwith how to cook and eat it here; for it is to be the staff of life for all Europe in time coming, I apprehend. We find our tolerablest way of cookery is to make it first into <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi> (exactly like oatmeal), then to tie it up in a linen cloth, and boil it for many hours;&#x2014;the bitter <hi rend="italic">diminishes</hi> by that method, but never quite disappears, and the whole thing has somewhat <pb id="pg-23-174" n="23:174"/>of the character of <hi rend="italic">sawdust</hi> to the very last! I believe we are quite ignorant yet how to manage it; which is a pity, for the poor people will hardly look at it,&#x2014;and a pound of it here, ample food I should think for a man for one day, can be had in the shops for little more than a penny! No food, not potatoes or any other, ever promised to be such a blessing to poor Europe.</p>
<p>But I must have done, dear Brother; being hard up for time today. Alas, I am getting very badly on, or not on at all, with any kind of work yet,&#x2014;and have many interruptions from without and from within:&#x2014;nevertheless I continue to believe that there is but one chance for me: Persevere, persevere!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Poor Charles Buller, my old Pupil, died suddenly last week, and has created an extensive sorrow among some classes connected with us. He was 42 years old: a very pleasant, cheerful, clear, unaffected man; possessed of much ready talent, but given a little to idling away his time among fashionable people, who much admired him: he was in office since our Whigs came last into power, and was likely to rise, and gain money, reputation &#x26;c,&#x2014;but much work did not lie in him, I think; his stroke was essentially rather <hi rend="italic">swift</hi> than <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">strong.</hi> His poor old Mother lost her husband last year, and is now utterly bereaved (Arthur Buller being in India):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur William Buller (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869">69</date>), Charles&#x2019;s brother, appointed a judge of the supreme court in Calcutta in <date when="1848-07">July</date>; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220112-TC-JCE-01"><sic>2:4&#x2013;5</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1822-01-12">12 Jan. 1822</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400224-TC-MAC-01"><sic>12:55</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1840-02-24">24 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420812-JWC-TC-01"><sic>15:11</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1842-08-12">12 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;Jane has been a good deal with her, for her case is truly sad,&#x2014;under which she bears up wonderfully. Many deaths have been here, in late months, among persons known to us; it is a sorrowful kind of season in the circles we are used to.&#x2014; &#x2014; Ireland seems breaking up as one man, to come over into England, and see if it can find life there! There was never seen till now a real influx of Irish beggary. The Landlords there are clearing their estates, burning down the sod huts, and the wretches must either die, or come over upon us. Their potatoe, on which they madly trusted, has again utterly failed them. There never was such a phenomenon before as the Ireland that now is. It makes my heart sick; and I would fain write about it, but cannot.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, enough for today. Remember about the Newspaper,&#x2014;do not forget! Be thankful that you have no &#x201C;spectre of a candlemas rent&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Candlemas, <date when="--02-02">2 Feb.</date>, being one of the four term days on which rents, taxes, etc., were due in Scotland.</note> that you are safe away from the tribulations and deliriums that are afflicting all corners of this old world at present.</p>
<p><closer><salute>We send our affectionate regards to Jenny, to Jane and Tom and all of you; our blessings on your innocent Homestead and all its honest industries and endeavours, among the wildernesses far away. Well speed the <pb id="pg-23-175" n="23:175"/><hi rend="italic">plough</hi> there, and right well the Plougher! He reaps his own bread from the soil, and is making it ready for millions yet unborn.

<salute>Dear Geraldine,</salute>
<p>I hope this Note will find you by such address as I can remember: your help is wanted again,&#x2014;in the matter of Cigarettes, in a private way!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-23-176" n="23:176"/>We can get no proper <hi rend="italic">Paper</hi> here for the making of those invaluable appendages to domestic life. Paltry little <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> of Cigarette-paper are on sale here, manufactured in France; but they do not fit the Cigarette-mould at all, require to be huddled together by hand merely; and are, in brief, a distressing undeniable failure,&#x2014;unless help of yours intervene.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had asked Jewsbury to send him a cigarette-making machine in <date when="1846">1846</date> as a Christmas present for JWC; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461127-TC-GEJ-01"><sic>21:99&#x2013;100</sic><corr>TC to GEJ, <date when="1846-11-27">27 Nov. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>By some honest method or other, I flatter myself, you can procure a proper stock of the kind of Paper we once before had from you, in <hi rend="italic">sheets;</hi> pray do so, a stock of fair quantity, of right quality; note accurately the cost; and let me have the Article, and the account, in my hand on <hi rend="italic">Christmas Eve</hi> at latest;&#x2014;keeping a due depth of <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> in regard to the whole transaction! I love to believe that you can do this for me, and that you will, beneficent being as you are. France being all busy electing its sublime Napoleon (one of the grandest achievements these latter ages have seen, surely),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The new constitution, drawn up by the constituent assembly, <date when="1848-11-01">1 Nov.</date>, vested the legislative power in a single assembly of 750 members and executive power in a pres. elected for one term by universal male suffrage every four years. In the presidential election, <date when="1848-12-10">10 Dec.</date>, Prince Louis Napoleon (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873">73</date>), Napoleon I&#x2019;s nephew and pretender to the Napoleonic succession, won by 5,434,226 votes over Cavaignac&#x2019;s 1,448,107 and became pres., <date when="1848-12-20">20 Dec.</date></note> we cannot apply to France; and if Manchester, aided by Dalbereglew,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stavros Dilberoglue.</note> cannot help us, what in the world are we to do?</p>
<p>The Gospel according to your friend George is getting itself put <hi rend="italic">in action</hi> in these days;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Sand had become the unofficial and unpaid minister of information in the provisional govt. in <date when="1848-03">March</date> and was responsible for disseminating all information, composing manifestoes, govt. circulars, and letters to the people.

The moderates won, and her role ended. Despite rumors of her possible arrest after the disturbances, <date when="1848-05-15">15 May</date>, the govt. ignored her and she retreated disillusioned to Nohant.</note> and certainly, so far as I can judge, the Heavens never saw the like before! I am glad, however, they are getting it <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> to the uttermost. If that really is the eternal law of the gods for us, we ought to do that, and to denounce and detest whatever is not that.&#x2014; Other such high noon of Human Stupidity, and prurient Apehood charged with a &#x201C;mission&#x201D; in this universe, one might wait long centuries, and not see. The bets are, that France, if it do not shew more sense than we yet see symptoms of, will become a big Ireland, and may look out for some fate like that of Poland<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Poland had been repartitioned by Russia, Prussia, and Austria, <date when="1815">1815</date>, with a small kingdom of Poland under Russian control and an independent republic of Cracow.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We are very glad to hear of you as out of Dumfries at least, which for whatever reason seems to be a really dangerous place at present. Thank James for his little Note, which was well bestowed upon us, as well as your own of yesterday: we shall now fancy you remaining quiet on the top of the Knowe yonder, and letting the free Solway breezes blow round you till the danger seems to be over in Dumfries.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was staying with her sister Mary Austin at the Gill.</note> A person that has no work to do there, is surely called upon to make his escape from it in circumstances like these.</p>
<p>It quite passes all my philosophy to guess what can have occasioned this sad preeminence of Dumfries, a second time, in the matter of Cholera. Jack here has no account to give of it, except that Dumfries is the <hi rend="italic">dirtiest</hi> town &#x26;c; and with this he professes to be quite satisfied; tho&#x2019;, I confess, with me, it will not act at all. Dumfries, in its dark closes, is unfortunately too dirty,&#x2014;an evil which we hope will be resolutely amended before long;&#x2014;but who, in his wits, can suppose that it is a twentieth-part so dirty as many other places,&#x2014;as Paris, for example, which contains a million of inhabitants, and, till 20 years ago, actually had no subterranean drains at all; or as Lisbon, a City of perhaps 200,000, where, in a hot climate too, all the entrails of animals, broken wreck, and dirt and horror of every description has been thrown upon the streets (the rats &#x26;c &#x26;c eating it diligently at noonday) for above a thousand years, and no besom ever acted there (except once while the French had possession) since the first formation of <pb id="pg-23-178" n="23:178"/>it! &#x201C;Dirt&#x201D; is evidently a Cock that will not fight.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane&#x2019;s guess I take to be a little better: That natural <hi rend="italic">terror</hi>, grounded on the black reminiscence of the past, has a good deal to do with it: a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> severe cases, in the gloomy weather, and mouth of winter, creating panic in the mind of the public, I can believe that to be exceeding effectual;&#x2014;but, on the whole, one would recommend Doctors to <hi rend="italic">search</hi> farther, and to admit in the meanwhile that no man knows almost anything but mere superficialities about the matter. Thank Heaven, you at least are out of it; do not ever think of venturing back till the fearful visitation have passed, or the <hi rend="italic">panic</hi> at least have subsided.</p>
<p>We have <hi rend="italic">unnaturally</hi> bright and beautiful weather here; and are well in health, if not doing much good otherwise. Jack is just about getting out his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>,&#x2014;a tremendous job is going to end! The Book will really be a creditable useful one of its kind. And right glad are we to see it <hi rend="italic">done.</hi> As for me I can yet get on with nothing; and must content myself with much preliminary plunging and puddling,&#x2014;alas, alas!&#x2014; How is Mary your Hostess? It is long since we heard a word from her. She is still rather weakly, the Doctor says; we hope she takes care of herself: warm clothes, and diet that is <hi rend="italic">found</hi> suitable,&#x2014;there is no other hope for one but in that direction. We have renounced Potatoes here altogether, and sorrowfully but heroically persist in Indian meal. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Jean; blessings on you and them all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Before the Post close, I will write you a small word. Not that there is anything to say in the way of news,&#x2014;nothing but the usual routine of things going on among us:&#x2014;however, you will be glad to hear even that.</p>
<p>Our beautiful weather broke down, three days ago, into wild blustering rain; and today is as ugly a day of dim deliberate wet and mud as anybody need desire to see. Not very much rain, only a universal <hi rend="italic">dripping</hi>, the whole air <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> as <hi rend="italic">jelly;</hi> and so dark, it is all I can do to manage without <pb id="pg-23-179" n="23:179"/>candles, here in a little room with three windows, before 3 o&#x2019;clock! Very warm of temperature too,&#x2014;it is our regular <date when="--11">November</date> (or <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> <date when="--12">December</date>) weather; and we ought to be content with it. Indeed, as for me, I <hi rend="italic">am;</hi> for one gets a <hi rend="italic">quieter</hi> life here in rain than in other weather; and having thick old clothes, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">gutta-percha</hi></foreign> soles to my shoes, I get no hurt from the wet streets.</p>
<p>John has got, I believe, or is just about getting his Book fairly out of his hands at last: a desireable consummation! He will now take well with a little rest;&#x2014;and surely we shall all be content to see a bit of work <hi rend="italic">well done</hi> by a poor struggling brother! He was here, a little while ago, looking after Jane, but I did not see him.</p>
<p>Jane has gone off to spend the afternoon and night with poor Mrs Buller; she consulted John before going, whether it would be safe; and he answered, Yes. Mrs Buller has removed to <supplied>[a]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> place 3 miles from us now; and is, of course, very dreary and sad, poor woman: she wrote earnestly to Jane to come and see her. Jane has had three very weak days here (lost nearly the whole of two nights sleep, and the day before yesterday eat absolutely nothing): however, she feels much <hi rend="italic">stronger</hi> today, and Jack admits that perhaps it may do her good;&#x2014;so off she is, and I am not to see her again till tomorrow! She is always weakly, but holds together wonderfully too: Jack is extremely good to her in her headaches, and she is greatly obliged to him, as am I; but hardly anybody can render her much service in such cases,&#x2014;she has the pain to <hi rend="italic">suffer.</hi></p>
 <p>We were much relieved to learn that the Dumfries parties had got out of that frightful place till the pest pass away from it! It was surely altogether wise that they did so. The new virulence of Cholera in Dumfries, alone of all places, is a fact quite beyond all explanation I have yet heard: indeed, to read even Dr Sutherland&#x2019;s addresses,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sutherland (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">91</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26794"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Scottish promoter of public health, had left private medical practice earlier in <date when="1848">1848</date> to be an inspector for the board of health. He began observing the cholera epidemic in <date when="1848-08">Sept.</date>, and after trouble between the parochial board and doctors of Dumfries, he was called in by the board as inspector. He arrived in <date when="1848-12">Dec.</date>, gave advice on symptoms and treatment and recommendations for action; those to the full board, <date when="1848-12-11">11 Dec.</date>, were extensively reported in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>.</note> one surmises the Doctors still know almost nothing more than we (by aid of the plainest common-sense) do: one has to be very careful of one&#x2019;s general health; to know by <hi rend="italic">experience</hi> what will help any evil motion in the bowel-department; and doing the best and wisest one can, leave the issue peaceably to One Higher.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Jamie made a kind offer about potatoes: you are to thank him for me very much; but say, we have quite given up the root here; and have decided to struggle along with Indian Meal, in the hope that we shall <hi rend="italic">one day</hi> learn <pb id="pg-23-180" n="23:180"/>h<supplied>[ow]</supplied> to cook it! As matters stand, we do manage<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NLS 521.75 ends here.</note> to eat a portion of it daily; and fancy we shall begin to <hi rend="italic">like</hi> it by and by! I believe always it is not rightly managed in the <hi rend="italic">grinding;</hi> I wrote both to Emerson and to Alick, asking for light on it.&#x2014; There are Potatoes on sale constantly here; and often they have been offered me at dinners from home, but never any really <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, this year. The price of the carriage, added to the price in Annandale, would make a ruinously dear article here; and besides, if they were really good, they would quite dishearten us from our Indian-meal career!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am still smearing and <foreign><hi rend="italic">tewing</hi></foreign> [struggling] over my papers; and certainly, if I live, shall get to some kind of result by and by: but, alas, it is a long way off yet, and I have a <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi>ry</foreign> [muddy] step of road to go first.</p>
<p>Dear good Mother, how are you yourself! We want much to hear. Have you quite given up writing with your own hand? Jenny who is now with you, or Isabella whom you always have,&#x2014;let one of these, or somebody, send us a word without too long delay.</p>
<p>Here are two Letters from the Gill that came yesterday: perhaps I may as well inclose them? Let there be no <hi rend="italic">returning</hi> to Dumfries till all <hi rend="italic">danger</hi> or apprehension be over!</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother for this day; and expect soon to hear of me again, whether they write or <hi rend="italic">not.</hi> My love to one and all. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A friend of mine in Nottingham, to whom I mentioned you and your Lecture speculation, answers me that he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> considerably concerned with Mechanics Institutes in that district, and asks, Whether you aim at &#x201C;permanent employment&#x201D; in such things, or merely to &#x201C;lecture&#x201D; in the off-and-on way!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Joseph Neuberg&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1848-12-15">15 Dec.</date>; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18481123-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1848-11-23">23 Nov.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>I myself know not what your purposes now are,&#x2014;nor perhaps will it be easy even for you to say, till the Macready business adjust itself,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The arrangement for Maccall to teach the Macreadys&#x2019; son Henry; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18481124-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1848-11-24">24 Nov.</date></ref></note> concerning the practical state of which I am much in the dark hitherto.</p>
<p>In any case, I think it will be worth your while to cultivate a little farther <pb id="pg-23-181" n="23:181"/>acquaintance with this Nottingham friend of mine, who is a man of rather conspicuous influence (I believe) in that region, among that class of people, and certainly is one of the best-conditioned and wisest men I know in any quarter among the mercantile ranks. A German by birth, but speaks and writes English perfectly; wealthy, I understand;&#x2014;and well-affected, clearly, towards all that has worth in it. &#x201C;Joseph Neuberg Esq, Nottingham,&#x201D; that is the Address: mention me, if you have any definite proposal to make to him; and you will get it attended to, so far as the case admits.</p>
<p>I think it were good, at any rate, to send this gentleman a copy of some of your writings, which you think most descriptive of your present tendencies; three blue stamps, I suppose, will carry your chief <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> even,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Elements of Individualism</hi> (<date when="1847">1847</date>).</note> if you like that;&#x2014;and a brief Letter along with it would prepare him for farther communications. He, if there seem any feasibility in it, will be very ready to help you to <hi rend="italic">a hearing;</hi> and after that, it will depend on yourself,&#x2014;on the practical answer to this question, &#x201C;Do these human creatures take in what I say, and find some nourishment from it; or do they actually <hi rend="italic">not</hi> take it in?&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Espinasse, Maccall &#x201C;never forgot himself in his subject, and his self-assertion was not always attractive.&#x201D; Espinasse tells of hearing him lecture on the subject of genius: &#x201C;But this discourse was, though he never named himself or directly referred to himself, a dismal version of the autobiography of William Maccall.&#x201D; It was &#x201C;the most painful lecture to which I ever listened&#x201D; (252).</note> In the latter case no Neuberg or other friend can help; but only yourself can, if you like!</p>

<p>For a long time I have been quite delivered from the plague of <hi rend="italic">Special Juries</hi>, and had quite forgotten my old sufferings in that respect:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390213-TC-JCA-01"><sic>11:29&#x2013;30</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1839-02-13">13 Feb. 1839</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400701-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:180</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-07-01">1 July 1840</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401203-TC-JAC-01"><sic>341&#x2013;42</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-12-03">3 Dec. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> but here, tonight, has come a new kind of Summons to something they call &#x201C;County Court&#x201D; for Chelsea and Brompton, which is to meet in &#x201C;Sloane Street,&#x201D; where seemingly I am to serve as common Juror &#x201C;under penalty of &#xa3;5.&#x201C;&#x2014; For Heaven&#x2019;s sake, tell me what this new scourge of Satan means with me;&#x2014;in particular, whether they will actually inflict the &#xa3;5 fine if I do not go, or whether it is merely (as in the Special-Jury case) a vague <hi rend="italic">threatening</hi> of fine, which may or may not be inflicted? In the latter case I will run my <pb id="pg-23-182" n="23:182"/>risk (as I have often already done); in the former I believe I had better resolve to go, detestable as the operation is. May the gods soon end &#x201C;Trial by Jury,&#x201D; say I, for one! In no Law Court was I ever, nor intend ever to go into one; and is it thus that I must be badgered, all my days, with their&#x2014; &#x2014; But I will not swear about it! Pray tell me is the fine meant to be certainly inflicted or not?</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>A certain Mr Edward Strachey, a Cousin of the late C. Buller&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The mothers of Charles Buller and Edward Strachey were sisters, b. Kirkpatrick.</note> a good pious-minded <hi rend="italic">valetudinarian</hi> young man, known to me this long while, and well esteemed for his own and his Mother&#x2019;s and other kindred&#x2019;s sake, has endeavoured to cheer his loneliness by writing an Essay on Hamlet,&#x2014;which you here see <foreign><hi rend="italic">in ipso corpore</hi></foreign> [in the original].<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Shakespeare&#x2019;s Hamlet: An Attempt to Find the Key to a Great Moral Problem by a Methodical Analysis of the Play</hi> (<date when="1848">1848</date>); see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470514-TC-ES-01"><sic>21:209&#x2013;10</sic><corr>TC to ES, <date when="1847-05-14">14 May 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> He writes to beg expressly that I would &#x201C;introduce it to the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner.</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a possible notice there, which it never received.</note> Heavens, that is easily done;&#x2014;but what will that same Editor say of it when introduced!

I will tell poor Strachey that I have done the feat of &#x201C;introduction&#x201D;; and that the Upper Powers, uncontrollable by mortal entreaty, are doing what they see fit in consequence.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago I glanced thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> myself; found it full of good intention; really very well as to execution too in its way;&#x2014;&#x201C;altogether very well&#x201D;; and fit for pious souls, round a country fire, in a winter evening, if they had a taste for that kind of matter.

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>The notion of its being Christmas time when people are, or ought to be, all &#x201C;merry&#x201D; complicates my difficulties in writing letters&#x2014;for a <hi rend="italic">merry</hi> letter such as would beseem the season is wholly above the reach of my imaginative powers&#x2014; And therefore do I write to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> instead of to my Uncle to whom my heart most devoutly wishes all the good wishes that one is in the habit of giving voice or ink to on the approach of a new year. You are to kiss him for me, and tell him that I hope to kiss him myself before another year is done. and that he is to wish this good wish for me&#x2014;that if I live to his age I may be found then <hi rend="italic">as good a man</hi> as he is god bless him&#x2014;</p>
 <p>Since I got your last I have been two days in bed&#x2014;with that eternal <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi>&#x2014;and three days and two nights on a visit to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller at the other Side of Hyde Park<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490113-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1849-01-13">13 Jan. 1849</date></ref>, she had taken a house ca. 3 mi. away; perhaps to be near Lady Agnes Buller (d. <date when="1856">1856</date>), wife of a second cousin of Charles Buller, Sr., at 5 Seamore Pl., Curzon St.</note>&#x2014; This locality for her is extremely inconvenient for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;in the short cold days and I have to go seldomer and stay longer&#x2014; On Friday gone a week she sent a miserable letter beseeching me to come for some days as Fleming was gone to the Grange&#x2014;and I could do no otherise than go&#x2014; &#x201C;Very mad&#x201D; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C called my going&#x2014;for I had not slept for two nights and was ill enough&#x2014;but John said I could not, at her house, &#x201C;sleep worse than none&#x2014;and perhaps the change might do me some good&#x201C;&#x2014;and so it did&#x2014;I felt a great calm come over me when I lay down in that new bed&#x2014;and in spite of carriages rushing by all night, and a housemaid snoring in the next room&#x2014;I got the best sleep I had had for many weeks&#x2014; She is a sad spectacle and every time I see her I feel more desperate of being any help to her&#x2014; It is not her <hi rend="italic">grief</hi> that is saddest in it&#x2014;that is nothing like so violent as one might have anticipated&#x2014;and her health seems to me rather better than it has been for years&#x2014;but it is the complete giving up of herself to the sensations of the moment; her complete want of self denial where a momentary indulgence brings prolonged suffering&#x2014;her recklessness about expence where the merest whim is concerned&#x2014;all <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is miserable to see; for it overlays her <hi rend="italic">great</hi> sorrow with the meanest troubles and difficulties&#x2014;and will drive away from her much sympathy and many consolations that might have cheered her remaining years.&#x2014; Lady A <pb id="pg-23-185" n="23:185"/>is with her husband at the Grange&#x2014;Fleming writes that he left her on Monday in much better health and spirits&#x2014;but her last letter&#x2014;to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;was sad as death&#x2014;as sorrowful a letter as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could have written&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is unwearied in writing consolations, and sending her books and doing every thing that in him lies to comfort her, and she seems extremely grateful for his kindness&#x2014;Lady Sandwich goes to her on Tuesday&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> will be no comfort&#x2014;meanwhile Lady S will be rather a loss to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, for she is the pleasantest person I have here just now to go off and talk with when I am too bad company for myself She seems very fond of me, and she who was always represented to me as the most insolent of English Peeresses is precisely the only one of them I have known with whom I feel entirely free to say what I like, and whom I can run in to with as little ceremony as I could do to any old woman living on a hundred a year&#x2014; Miss Wynn who was my most constant visitor last winter, and for whom my friendship always increases the longer I know her, has got some lingering illness that makes me rather anxious and is sent out of London for the present&#x2014;B&#xF6;lte is still a<supplied>[t]</supplied> Brighton<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From <date when="1847">1847</date> to <date when="1850">1850</date>, Amalie B&#xF6;lte lived with the family of Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid (<date when="1778">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">1859</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10920"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), financier and philanthropist, possibly as a paid companion to his da., Anna Maria (<date when="1805">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889">89</date>; <ref target="volume-23/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10916"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), philanthropist and trans.

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>Your Christmas Gift, punctual as the Sun to his place in the Eclyptic, arrived safe on Saturday evening; part of it, I suppose, is to be sacrificed to the ancient Gods this very day. And now with the morning&#x2019;s post has your kind good Letter also come. Thanks to you for all these gifts; for all the love you feel and manifest to me. Nowhere is there left to me on this Earth, a more reasonable, true and modest Friend. Thanks, thanks;&#x2014;and may you live to see many kind Christmasses, if &#x201C;merry&#x201D; ones are not to be expected, or even much to be wished (if we knew all the secret), and may the latter <pb id="pg-23-187" n="23:187"/>end of these two men be <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, and not worse, than the beginning!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 42:12.</note> Amen.</p>
<p>A little Book of mine, new edition of a Book which you perhaps have but not from me,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note> is gone towards you: marked for Newyearday; but I fear it will hardly have got beyond Cardiff at that date,&#x2014;unless Chapman and Hall communicate direct with Cowbridge, which latter hypothesis I doubt. Consider it as on the way, at any rate: and if after the due space it do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> arrive (silence shall mean that it <hi rend="italic">has</hi> arrived), write me a word.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more appropriate than your comforting considerations on the dispiritments of Authorship. Never in my life hitherto did I feel so <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> as even in these current months and years. The nothingness of all I have said, or can say, stands sad and stern before me; most poor, most small seems every way spoken or speakable word. My heart is full of meaning, too; as if sunk, and near drowned, in black lakes of incondite meaning:&#x2014;I shall get some word for them by and by; or be taught by the Gods to suppress them, which latter also is a blessed result, at times. As I grow older, this universe grows ever sterner, awfuller, to me, but also ever grander, more beautiful, diviner;&#x2014;and I study to possess my soul in silence at least, if not in patience or in peace!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 21:19. TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1848-12-29">29 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Darwin said to Jane, the other day, in his quizzing-serious manner, &#x2018;Who will write Carlyle&#x2019;s Life?&#x2019;&#x2014; The word, reported to me, set me thinking how <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> it was, and would forever remain, for any creature to write my &#x2018;Life&#x2019;; the <hi rend="italic">chief</hi> elements of my little destiny have all along lain deep below view of surmise, and never will or can be known to any Son of Adam. I would say to my Biographer, if any fool undertook such a task, &#x2018;Forbear, poor fool; let no Life of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> be written; let me and my bewildered wrestlings be buried here, and be forgotten swiftly of all the world. If thou write, it will be mere delusions and hallucinations. The confused world never understood, nor will understand, me and my poor affairs; not even the persons nearest me could guess at them;&#x2014;nor was it found indispensable; nor is it <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, for any but an idle purpose, profitable, were it even possible. Silence,&#x2014;and go thy ways elsewhither!&#x201D; Froude did not include this passage.</note> Few men, in this wretched time, are sensible of the omnipresence of an Eternal Justice in this world and in their own poor lives there; the feeling of this as an actual <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>, not intended for Sunday preaching only, is a thing to keep one silent now and then.</p>
<p>When I shall in the body see Glamorganshire again is by no means yet made out; but I do give you to understand that it often enough comes into my head as a little City of Refuge<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Num. 35:13.</note> in these very times,&#x2014;and even in that point of view, tho&#x2019; I never <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> it more, is a real possession to me.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had visited Redwood there, <date when="1843-07">July 1843</date>.</note> Who knows what morning I may take the resolution, suddenly pack together a <pb id="pg-23-188" n="23:188"/>portmanteau, and on the wings of steam fly thither!

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I am not good for anything today; and therefore may as well scribble you a word, for payment of my debt, and to invite farther news, before taking <pb id="pg-23-189" n="23:189"/>up any other pretence of employment. I have had baddish sleep these two nights, am otherwise considerably put off my aim, and indeed do not get on well with any work this long while:&#x2014;so have at <hi rend="italic">you!</hi></p>
<p>We were very glad indeed to learn by your last Letter, and by Aird&#x2019;s and the other Newspaper reports, that the Pest seems fast abating <supplied>[in]</supplied> Dumfries: the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of its extreme violence there so far a [words missing] philosophy goes, appears to lie dark as ever [words missing] and stay away, that will be the grand and [words missing.] As to the rest, Nature itself teaches <supplied>[that uncleanliness, unfav]</supplied>ourable to health generally, must be a weakener of the body, and an ally and encouragement to Cholera and to every disease. If the Dumfries people, therefore, will effectually sweep and wash their dirty closes and recesses, and keep them effectually washed; and get clear running water (which surely is abundant in that region), and <hi rend="italic">drain</hi> themselves; and keep clear of <hi rend="italic">whisky</hi> (probably a good deal concerned in this affair); and, in short, try in all ways to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what the everlasting Law of Things, very clearly revealed by &#x201C;Common Sense,&#x201D; in regard to such affairs prescribes to all creatures,&#x2014;they may reap some fruit from this heavy visitation, and perhaps avoid the like in future. One of their projects does somewhat astonish me,&#x2014;that of &#x201C;agitating&#x201D; Cholera against Lochar Moss!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A tract of moorland 10 mi. long from the Solway Firth to 3 mi. SE of Dumfries. The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1848-12-12">12 Dec.</date>, reported Dr. Sutherland as saying that there was &#x201C;nothing peculiar in the situation of Dumfries, to render it so severely liable to the ravages of epidemics, with the exception of the vicinity of Lochar Moss.&#x201D;</note> James, I perceived, had marked it in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, and truly it was worth marking. Collin, Gasstown, Torthorwald &#x26;c, and Farms and Houses enough on the very moss itself, all free from <supplied>[cholera]</supplied> and Dumfries at 3 or 4 miles distance, attacked by the fell <supplied>[disease.]</supplied> By all manner of means &#x201C;drain Lochar Moss,&#x201D; you cannot <supplied>[words missing]</supplied>; but you will not &#x201C;remove Cholera&#x201D; by that, you may <supplied>[words missing]</supplied> itude, or square the circle by that! In fact, people generally are apt, especially in terror, to be very great <foreign><hi rend="italic">gomerals</hi></foreign> [idiots]. Mosses are ugly to a degree, and ought to be removed, everywhere; but not for health&#x2019;s sake chiefly, I apprehend! Many a right stout fellow lives on mosses (if they are not quite too slobbery and hot): I have seen heavy-boned Steels from the Breckonbeds,&#x2014;nay Oliver Cromwell himself was born and bred, and passed 4 fifths of his life, on the edge or in the heart of a &#x201C;Moss,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:22&#x2013;23. Steels are unidentified. Breconbeds is &#xbe; mi. from Kirtlebridge on the Annan road.</note> which has &#x201C;Roman roads in it 40 feet deep&#x201D; (surface has grown 40 feet in these 1800 years), and is as big as Dumfriesshire and the next two Counties all in one!&#x2014; &#x2014; The practical hope, however, is, dear Jean, that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will continue all steady where you now are,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the Gill, nr. Annan.</note> till the disease declare itself past, and no apparent <pb id="pg-23-190" n="23:190"/>danger remain; then go home to your affairs again:&#x2014;that is the whole gist of my speculation, and for me there is nothing else practical in it at present.</p>
<p>We have had four days of beautiful frost here, then three of the gentlest thaw; last night it began blowing, with rain, and this morning we have a cold heavy breeze from the North; so that I suppose frost is coming back. No work is going on here about this Christmas time; nothing but junketing and festivities,&#x2014;the poorest people (by means of &#x201C;Goose-clubs,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Groups formed to share or raffle a goose.</note> or otherwise,&#x2014;did such an institution as a &#x201C;goose-club&#x201D; ever enter into man&#x2019;s imagination <hi rend="italic">elsewhere!</hi>) contriving to have something savoury to eat at this &#x201C;sacred season.&#x201D; We may be said this year to have less to do with it than ever; <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> merely till it end. Alas! work is not possible for me any more than for those poor feasters and <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> playgoers: but I can at least be <hi rend="italic">sorrowful</hi> for the want of possibility to work, and that will make work a little <hi rend="italic">more</hi> possible, one day, perhaps! I have plenty to <hi rend="italic">say;</hi> but the way of saying it seems undiscoverable;&#x2014;perhaps the heart for struggling to say it is also a little weaker than common at present. Hope, always hope; and try, try!</p>
<p>Jack, as you know, has at length got out his Book;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pbd., ca. <date when="1848-12-23">23 Dec.</date>, by Chapman &#x26; Hall.</note> an immense affair for him, poor fellow. I have read it carefully over; and find it most faithfully executed in every fibre of it,&#x2014;a bit of genuinely honest labour, creditable to the house, and to the man. It is perfectly certain to sell either slower or faster, and will long be regarded as a truly useful Book by the small but <hi rend="italic">perpetual</hi> public that studies <hi rend="italic">Dante.</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1848-12-29">29 Dec.</date>, TC wrote: &#x201C;Brother John&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> (Inferno), just out, read the other day. Most faithful bit of &#x2018;human labour&#x2019;; a completely clear idea of Dante&#x2019;s meaning to be had there for the first time.&#x2014; Poor Jack, he is somewhat pathetic to me, tho&#x2019; occasionally very fretting in my impatient conditions. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Basta</hi></foreign> [Enough].&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; Your tidings of our dear and brave old Mother were, as you may fancy, precious to us. I meant to write to her too today; but perhaps I had better bid you send this on to her and not write myself till there is greater scarcity of news. Do that then. And let me have a little word from you when you think of returning.&#x2014; Poor toiling Mary, how is she? Tell her she is not, nor ever will be, forgotten here; but all good wishes are silently sent her. <closer><salute>My blessings on every one. Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>Here is another year done&#x2014;and you and I are still here to say &#x2018;rest in peace&#x2019; to it. I hope the new one finds you better in health than you were last winter&#x2014; There has been a sad time again in your neighbourhood&#x2014;it is very strange why Dumfries should be so particularly visited by this disease&#x2014;&#x201C;dirty&#x201D;? why yes! but can anyone say it is to be compared <hi rend="italic">in dirt</hi> to St Giles s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A congested and poverty-stricken region known as the &#x201C;rookery of St. Giles,&#x201D; at the extreme E end of Oxford St.</note> and many other parts of London and Edin where there has been next to no cholera at all&#x2014;then they talk of the water&#x2014;but the Thames at Chelsea must be infinitely more impure water than the Nith at Dumfries The finest, thought of all was Lochor Moss being the cause!&#x2014;and all the people living on and nearest to the Moss having no cholera at all! What does D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell think? There has been much sickness here tho pretty free from Cholera&#x2014;chiefly smallpox and scarlet fever&#x2014; I do think these <hi rend="italic">mild</hi> winters are dreadfully unwholesome&#x2014; Still <hi rend="italic">I</hi> individually may be thankful for the delay of the frost as I am still going about, free from cough&#x2014; I suffer plenty with my headachs and sickness at stomach&#x2014;but all that only <hi rend="italic">lay me up</hi> for a day at a time&#x2014;and I have got to be quite content if I can only keep out of bed and the confinement of my own room during winter.</p>
<p>Pray write me a good long letter about your self and Father and Husband and every body I know there&#x2014; You have no notion how welcome a letter of home news always is to me, even when there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> nothing new or strange to tell</p>
<p>I went no further than Hampshire this autumn we staid six weeks at a fine Place called the Grange, belonging to Lord Ashburton&#x2014;the visit was anything but a <hi rend="italic">retirement</hi>&#x2014;for in London we should not have seen half as many people&#x2014;the House being filled with company the whole time&#x2014;on my return to town I had to undergo a change of servant&#x2014;if change it can be called this time&#x2014;the nice little woman I had had these two years had made up her mind at last to conclude her five-years courtship and go off with her husband to live in Jersey&#x2014; I was very sorry for I had got to like her extremely well&#x2014;and she was very sorry too, but people must get married before all! She was quite willing however to wait till I could get &#x201C;settled&#x201D; (as they call it here) to my mind&#x2014;and before I had so much as begun to <pb id="pg-23-192" n="23:192"/><hi rend="italic">un</hi>settle myself, there came a letter from my old Helen, giving me to know that her irish adventure had been <hi rend="italic">no go</hi>, that she was returned to Kircaldy keeping &#x201C;a small shop&#x201D; there, which was not like to be <hi rend="italic">a go</hi> either and in short that she would like to go to service again&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">If I knew any place for her in London</hi>&#x2014; It was plain enough she wished to come back <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&#x2014; and in my horror of strangers I told her to come then since Ann was going at any rate&#x2014; I hardly think I did wisely&#x2014;the two years of insubordination and breaking up of all old habits were likely to have increased all the faults it had taken me so long to put down in her&#x2014;and I do find her very tiresome as yet&#x2014;and if she do not improve thro the winter I shall have to change again when the warm weather comes, and I am likely to keep on foot&#x2014;</p>
<p>I send you a Christmas book&#x2014;written by the cleverest <hi rend="italic">popular</hi> writing we have just now&#x2014;but hardly worthy of him I think&#x2014;the plates are the best of it<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clearly Dickens&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Haunted Man and the Ghost&#x2019;s Bargain</hi> (<date when="1848">1848</date>), illust. by Clarkson Stanfield, Frank Stone, John Leech, and John Tenniel.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is a long sad time since I have written to you, or could expect to hear any word directly from you: for indeed I have been, and still am, in an altogether <hi rend="italic">inarticulate</hi> condition; writing to nobody; in the highest degree indisposed to writing, or uttering of myself, in any kind! You do not doubt but many kind thoughts and remembrances have crossed the sea to you, all this while; nor do we want evidence of the like on your part; nay, from Miss Wynn and otherwise, we have pretty accurately known how you were going on, and have generally had some image of you kept lucid and vivid in our circle here. Forgive my silence&#x2014;silence is not good altogether, when there are kind hearts that will listen and reply! The advent of the New Year admonishes me that I should open my leaden lips, and speak <hi rend="italic">once</hi> more,&#x2014;were it but as Odin&#x2019;s Prophetess did, from the belly of the Grave!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In &#x201C;Balder&#x2019;s Dreams&#x201D; in the poetic <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi>, Odin travels to the eastern door of the high house of Hel and summons the Volve, or prophetess, from her grave; she explains his son Balder&#x2019;s dreams and foretells his death: &#x201C;I was loth to speak, now let me cease.&#x201D;</note> In the <pb id="pg-23-193" n="23:193"/>language of the season, I wish you a right brave New Year, and as many of them as your heart can still victoriously front in such a world. <hi rend="italic">Courage! <foreign>En avant</foreign></hi> [Forward]! I will start up too, some day, and march along with you again, I doubt not.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago your little Pamphlet on the question of German Unity (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Schlichte Reden</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">Plain Talk</hi>]) came to me;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Schlichter Vortrag an die Deutschen &#xfc;ber die Aufgabe des Tages [Plain Talk to the Germans About the Tasks for the Day]</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1848">1848</date>).</note> a welcome little word, which I read with entire assent. This was your message hitherward; and now, the other day, I despatched for you a little old Book of mine which they have been republishing here;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.</note>&#x2014;a Book of no moment; which probably you already have received: let this be a small memento from me, when you look upon it. Whether I shall ever write another Book in this world has often seemed uncertain to me of late; but I believe I shall have to try it again before long, or else do worse!</p>
<p>What a year we have had since <date when="1848-02">February</date> last! The universal breaking down of old rotten thrones, and bursting up of street-barricades; enfuriated Sansculottism everywhere starting up, and glaring like a world-basilisk into the empty <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wan-Wan</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Delusion or void.</note> that pretended to be a god to it. &#x201C;What <hi rend="italic">art</hi> thou, accursed contemptibility of a <foreign>Wan-Wan</foreign>?&#x201C;&#x2014; It is to me the most sordid, scandalous and dismal sight the world ever offered in my time; and if there were not in the dark womb of that &#x201C;abomination of desolation&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 24:15.</note> a ray of eternal light for me, I should think (like poor Niebuhr)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Barthold Georg Niebuhr (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831">1831</date>), Prussian historian, statesman, and philologist; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291222-TC-G-01"><sic>5:49</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1829-12-22">22 Dec. 1829</date></corr></ref>.</note> the universe was going out, and pray for my own share, &#x201C;From me hide it!&#x201D; But withal I discern well, none more loyally, It is a <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> phenomenon, a fulfilment of the eternal prophecies, the beginning of a newbirth of the world: A general &#x201C;bankruptcy of Imposture&#x201D; (so I define it); Imposture, long known by the wise for what it was, is now known and declared for such to the foolish at the market-cross, and <hi rend="italic">admits</hi> openly that it is a <hi rend="italic">bankrupt</hi> piece of scoundrelism, and requests only time to gather up its rags, and walk away unhanged. How can I lament at this? Dismal, abominable as the sight is, I cannot but intrinsically rejoice at it. And yet what a Future lies before us, for centuries to come,&#x2014;if we had any thought within us, which very few have.</p>
<p>The feeling here among considerate persons is, that Germany, in spite of all the explosion of nonsense we have seen, will certainly recover some <pb id="pg-23-194" n="23:194"/>balance; and march, like a brave country,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> towards Chaos, as some others seem to do! We can understand that it is all the levity, the froth and mutinous folly that comes <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to the top: but Germany deceives us all if there be not abundant <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> heroic faculty in the heart of it;&#x2014;and indeed it is to England and Teutschland that the Problem seems to me now to have fallen: and a dreadful Problem it is,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in</hi>soluble by the Southern genius, as we see. <closer><salute>God assist us all!&#x2014; I am / ever your affectionate Friend,</salute></closer></p>

It was a natural question for TC to ask, though in notes attached to this letter Varnhagen copies part of a letter, dated &#x201C;London, <date when="1848-12">December 1848</date>,&#x201D; from TC to Charlotte Williams Wynn about the new work: &#x201C;I have read little yet&#x2014;Goethe is quite Wertherian&#x2014;and the Frau von Stein, a consummate flirt, seems to have led an edifying life,&#x2014;what did the poor Herr von Stein say to it?&#x201D; Varnhagen remarks: &#x201C;(This is a coarse view, but so like Carlyle that I give it.) / This philistine pettiness of such a judgement from Carlyle here strikes me, and not for the first time.

<salute>Dear Eckermann,</salute>
<p>At last, after repeated applications, I have obtained a Letter from the Prussian Ambassador; which gives me to know that the affair of your Goethe Manuscript has been satisfactorily settled.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eckermann had, through TC, offered a part of Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> MS for sale to the Prussian govt.; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480529-TC-JPE-01">TC to JPE, <date when="1848-05-29">29 May 1848</date></ref>. TC had written to Bunsen about the matter, <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480718-TC-CKJB-01"><date when="1848-07-18">18 July 1848</date></ref>, but had received no satisfactory reply. Apparently TC had then written again to Bunsen later in <date when="1848">1848</date>, and Bunsen answered, <date when="1849-01-03">3 Jan.</date> TC made a copy of the letter and then sent it to Eckermann. TC&#x2019;s copy of Bunsen&#x2019;s letter (British Lib. 3032.5) reads: &#x201C;&#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Felix culpa</hi></foreign> [Fortunate mistake]! my delay has given me a Letter from you. I received <hi rend="italic">last month</hi> the intelligence that the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> had been discovered, and that the King had had great pleasure in acquiring it for the price desired by Eckermann, and then made a present of it to the Royal Library. I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> now written to Eckermann (Weimar), and desired him to cash his 50 ducats (?<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>). / It has done my heart good to hear your words about&#x2019; &#x26;c &#x26;c / &#x2026; . / <foreign><hi rend="italic">Copia vera</hi></foreign> [An abundance of truth].&#x2014;T. Carlyle, Chelsea <date when="1849-01-05">5 jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> / 1849</date>.&#x201D;</note> Thank Heaven! There has been more canvassing and negociating than so small a matter needed. Let me hope, however, that you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> now received the due sum of money; and that the business has finished itself, at length, according to your anticipation. I observe the Ritter Bunsen says you are to draw for &#x201C;fifty <hi rend="italic">ducats</hi>&#x201C;: I hope this is mere <hi rend="italic">wit</hi>, and that he means much better than so! The sum covenanted for between him and me, as he ought to remember well, was fifty <hi rend="italic">pounds</hi> sterling:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470629-TC-CKJB-01"><sic>21:244</sic><corr>TC to CKJB, <date when="1847-06-29">29 June 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> and if that is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the sum he has sent authority for, I would have you, before drawing or touching any money at all, write to him, and on my testimony, claim that! For it is yours, according to bargain. But I hope there is no mistake, after all; only a piece of dramatic wit, and &#x201C;pounds&#x201D; to be read practically instead of &#x201C;ducats.&#x201D; The Chevalier, as you see, is on the way to Frankfort, or Berlin at least, and has great things in the wind. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quod faustum sit</hi></foreign> [May it turn out favorably]. <foreign>&#x201C;Das sch&#xF6;ne heilige R&#xF6;m&#x2019;sche Reich, wie h&#xE4;lt&#x2019;s noch nur zusammen?&#x201C;</foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The good old Holy Roman Empire, / What holds it still together?&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> pt. 1, 2090&#x2013;91); TC&#x2019;s quotation from memory is slightly wrong. The German parliament, established democratically at Frankfurt following the revolutionary outbreaks in <date when="1848">1848</date>, was in disarray. Hoping for a strong, liberal union, the parliament planned to offer the crown of emperor to the Prussian king in Berlin, Frederick William IV (<date when="1795">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861">1861</date>), who refused it, <date when="1848-04-29">29 April</date>.</note> That really is a question now!</p>
<p>I have a reasonable little Copy of White&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Nat</hi>l <hi rend="italic">History of Selborne;</hi> which I will send to the Bookseller <hi rend="italic">Nutt</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Nutt (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863">63</date>), bookseller specializing in foreign books, 158 Fleet St.</note> this day, with request to have it forwarded to you by the shortest route he has. I shall rejoice to hear that it <pb id="pg-23-196" n="23:196"/>arrives soon and safe; some sympathy in reading it I dare anticipate from you; and if by example it kindle you into doing the like for Weimar and the Environs, truly it will be a Copy of a Book well bestowed! White was a peaceable Country Clergyman; his Parish <hi rend="italic">Selborne</hi> is in Hampshire on the South Coast of this Island,&#x2014;in that same region where William Rufus, the &#x201C;Red King&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William II (ca. <date when="1056">1056</date>&#x2013;<date when="1100">1100</date>), king of England, <date when="1087">1087</date>&#x2013;<date when="1100">1100</date>, called Rufus from his fiery complexion.</note> whom you may have heard of, was shot, hunting, long ago. Of all the Books of Natural History I have ever read, White&#x2019;s, in his healthy genial limitation, pleases me most. Go and do likewise!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 10:37.</note></p>
<p>I have been at Weimar often of late, as Marshal will tell you.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC means that he had been there imaginatively, having read Goethe&#x2019;s recently pbd. letters to Baroness von Stein, ed. Adolf Sch&#xF6;ll (<date when="1805">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882">82</date>).</note> I cannot yet tell completely what to make of the Frau von Stein and her affairs; but take with welcome any insight into the history and ways of Goethe, from what quarter soever. Sch&#xF6;ll I find extremely solemn; and these his blowings of the Gospel-trumpet over this new questionable Song of Songs, to verge towards the absurd occasionally!</p>
<p>Say to Dr Weissenborn, with many thanks, that I will keep his kind commission in my eye; but that I hardly know here any so serious reader of Schiller as to deserve such a relic.&#x2014; My own &#x201C;Literature,&#x201D; as Marshal may report, is in a very backgoing way just now! But a day will come, perhaps, notwithstanding. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Eckermann: write to me when these matters finish. Yours always</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here is a little Book for Eckermann once Goethe&#x2019;s Secretary; which if you can send to him by any moderately speedy conveyance, you will add another to your many kindnesses to me in that sort. I suppose Leipzig will be the nearest place which you have communication with? I have promised Eckermann that, by one of your many lines of communication, you will convey it soon.&#x2014; The Parcel, containing <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> but a Book, can be opened or modified in any way, if that be a convenience.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter, for your two Letters, which I duly received, and read with welcome. You are very good to remember me so kindly. I wish you had dwelt a little more on the vulgar article of &#x201C;news&#x201D;; especially Weimar news, of which there has been much since we last met, and much even that must have passed under your own eyes. The <hi rend="italic">history</hi> of man,&#x2014;in all forms of it,&#x2014;this is alone interesting to man!</p>
<p>A day after your last Letter, the Pamphlet<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> arrived: but it was charged with such a postage (5/10, I think), greatly beyond the shop price of the Pamphlet itself, that I had to refuse the article, and now it is wandering I know not where. If the Performance be at all as good as you surmise, it will probably find its way to the <hi rend="italic">London Library</hi>, and so to me, in a gratuitous manner; or I can order it from one of several Booksellers, if my curiosity awaken:&#x2014;but, alas, you do not know how dead I am grown to all that sort of ware; how, by repeated experience of a too fatal kind, I have learned to fear the Greeks,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 2:48.</note> especially when they speculate to me about &#x201C;Constitutions,&#x201D; franchises, systems of society and such like! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign>&#x2014; Such, you see, in spite of the &#x201C;<foreign>Franco tout</foreign> [all free of postage],&#x201D; and what that cost you, has been the fate of this unlucky Work thro&#x2019; our Post-Office and me: in general, for the future, I forbid you to send any Book in that manner. Nutt the Bookseller in Fleet-Street here, who I think communicates with Leipzig &#x26;c, and certainly with Berlin once a fortnight,&#x2014;he, if you think of sending a Book on any rare occasion, is the much surer channel. And so let us submit to the loss, on all sides, and learn better for time coming.</p>
<p>After a good deal of bother, Eckermann&#x2019;s affair is at last settled,&#x2014;at least I sincerely hope so, and that Bunsen&#x2019;s Banker has been drawn upon, and has paid the amount in hard cash! In these tumultuous times one could hardly get a Prussian Excellency<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >C. K. J. Bunsen.</note> to attend to so very private a matter; the rather as I never saw the Excellency, and had to manage by writing merely. However, here is his ultimatum now, and this day I enclose it to Eckermann, with my blessing.</p>
<p>Things all stand in this apartment pretty much as you left them; except that the Better Half having been extensively engaged in upholstering, paperhanging and so forth below stairs, has changed some of the Engravings here, and has even permitted me to hang up <hi rend="italic">maps</hi>, three or four, <pb id="pg-23-198" n="23:198"/>which are an unspeakable instruction now and then to a man! The poor apartment is very well:&#x2014;but, I think, as to utterance of &#x201C;Literature&#x201D; now or soon, there is hardly any darker apartment in the world than it. Most <hi rend="italic">in</hi>articulate at present; chaotic wholly, and abhorrent of speech, or the vain effort to speak! This &#x201C;general Bankruptcy of Humbug all over the world,&#x201D; one of the most scandalous sights the Sons of Adam ever saw, is enough to create <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> in a serious man. Enough of itself,&#x2014;if there were not plenty else, which there is. On the whole I love silence more and more, and speech less and less, in this world;&#x2014;and would recommend many a high literary and other talking or writing mortal to consider if he is not somewhat of the nature of a <hi rend="italic">drum</hi>, or brass instrument full of mere musical wind; and, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> so, to cease in God&#x2019;s name.</p>
<p>Thackeray, Dickens and the others carry on their affairs; Thackeray has risen quite into fashion<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mainly because of <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi> (<date when="1848">1848</date>); in pts., <date when="1847">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">48</date>.</note> since you were here. Nothing can convince me that the like of all that is a noble employment under this Sun; or that it is in fact any employment at all, different from what we see at Astley&#x2019;s Amphitheatre,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Astley&#x2019;s Royal Amphitheatre, Westminster Bridge Rd., founded by Philip Astley (<date when="1742">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814">1814</date>), mainly for equestrian performances.</note> or what the black Bayaderes<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Trained Indian dancing girls.</note> perform, in Oriental Countries, for some big surfeited ugly black rajah, who pays them surprisingly,&#x2014;of <hi rend="italic">whom</hi>, and of whose affairs Bayadere performances and other, the <hi rend="italic">Devil</hi> (as I discern well) will take charge one day!&#x2014; &#x2014;T. B. Macaulay makes the most noise during this week and last: he has just sent out two volumes of his History;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The History of England from the Accession of James II</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1849">1849</date>; in fact, <date when="1848-12-05">5 Dec. 1848</date>); two further vols. (<date when="1855">1855</date>).</note> promises 10 or 18 more; is read by innumerable mortals; has received (says Rumour) immense monies;&#x2014;whereat Flunkeyism, with upturned wondering eyes, talks and psalmodies. I know my man; and will read his Book, or try the reading of it, much at leisure by and by.&#x2014; Forster was here the night your Letter came: I gave him your message, which was evidently pleasant to him.</p>
<p>Why did you say nothing of Sch&#xF6;ll, and his Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;Letters to the Frau von Stein&#x201D;? Such a Publication ought to have set Weimar into a state of mind! I have read it, with some amazement, chiefly at the <hi rend="italic">male</hi> von Steins, father and especially son.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Josias Friedrich, Freiherr von Stein (<date when="1735">1735</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793">93</date>), master of horse to the Weimar court, and his youngest son, F. G. C. (Fritz) von Stein (<date when="1772">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844">1844</date>), who had lived in Goethe&#x2019;s home for three years and of whom Goethe was particularly fond.</note>&#x2014; These evenings I am reading <hi rend="italic">Viehoff;</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heinrich Viehoff (<date when="1804">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886">86</date>), probably <hi rend="italic">Goethes Leben</hi> (Stuttgart, <date when="1847">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">49</date>).</note> a diligent mortal, not without intelligence, but <hi rend="italic">flat-soled</hi>, and of a <hi rend="italic">breadth</hi> like a Russian Steppe! There is something damnable in that method of <pb id="pg-23-199" n="23:199"/>writing;&#x2014;indeed, as I told you, I am not sure that almost all writing is not damnable, in such times as ours!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Sir, if you or any good soul in Weimar can remember me kindly, do it.

<p><salute>My dear sir,&#x2014;</salute>Yesternight I read the preface and the last portion of your autobiography.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Early Days</hi> (<date when="1849">1849</date>).</note> I have followed the work throughout, as the successive instalments of it reached me by your kindness (for which I am much obliged): and now it is ended, handsomely, yet sooner than I quite expected. It seems to me you have managed the affair very well indeed; a manful rustic frankness runs thro&#x2019; it; a wholesome freshness, energy, sincerity: it is very clear everywhere, very credible; and, to sum up many merits in one, it is singularly memorable, and stands out in distinct visibility and continuity in one&#x2019;s mind after reading it. You will give an innocent and profitable pleasure, I hope, to very many persons by what you have written; and made known, with advantage to all parties, important forms of human life, in quarters where they have not been known hitherto, and much required to be known.</p>
<p>On the whole, however, we must not yet let you off, or allow you to persuade yourself that you have done with us. A vast deal more of knowledge about Lancashire operatives, and their ways of living and thinking, their miseries and advantages, their virtues and sins, still lies in your experience; and you must endeavour, by all good methods, to get it winnowed, the chaff of it well separated from the wheat, and to let us have the latter, as your convenience will serve. To workers themselves you might have much to say, in the way of admonition, encouragement, instruction, reproof; and the captains of workers, the rich people, are very willing also to listen to you, and certain of them will believe heartily what ever true things you tell them; this is a combination of auditors which nobody but yourself has such hold of at present; and you must encourage yourself to do with all fidelity whatever you can in that peculiar and by no means unimportant position you occupy. &#x201C;Brevity, sincerity,&#x201C;&#x2014;and in fact, all sorts of manful virtue,&#x2014;will have once more, as they everywhere in this world do, avail<supplied>[ed]</supplied> you.</p>
<p>Since I wrote last, I have never seen Lord Lansdowne; know not what he <pb id="pg-23-200" n="23:200"/>did with those Nos. of your book, or, indeed, whether he has ever yet fairly got hold of them, for his life all this while has been in the country, I suppose, amid a crowd of guests, and with little leisure for considerate reading. Pray tell me how the matter is when you next write. I wish you farther to address a copy of your book so soon as you have got it bound to Lord Ashburton, whose address I enclose; if the book is under half a pound weight it will go by post if you stick sixpence worth of stamps upon it; above a pound and under two it goes for a shilling&#x2019;s worth. And the note you write must bear a cover quite apart. <closer><salute>With many good wishes, yours,</salute></closer></p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sir</hi>,</salute>
<p>I read, about a year ago, the <hi rend="italic">Campaner Thal</hi> of Jean Paul F. Richter, translated by Miss Juliette Bauer,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480514-TC-JB-01">TC to JB, <date when="1848-05-14">14 May 1848</date></ref>.</note> of which you now receive a copy from that young lady,&#x2014;which, pray, look at, a little. Apart from a little indistinctness about the punctuation,&#x2014;due probably to the printer,&#x2014;I considered the translation really <hi rend="italic">good:</hi> and that it was a work worth translating, calculated to interest all serious and ingenious persons, is a fact that needs no testimony of mine.</p>
<p>The same young lady, it appears, has now prepared a translation of the little book called <hi rend="italic">Selina</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like the <hi rend="italic">Campaner Thal</hi> (see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480514-TC-JB-01">TC to JB, <date when="1848-05-14">14 May 1848</date></ref>), to which it is a sequel, it is on the immortality of the soul and was begun on the day of the funeral of Richter&#x2019;s nineteen-year-old son. Blindness prevented his finishing it, but the MS was borne on the coffin at his own funeral, then pbd. (Stuttgart, <date when="1827">1827</date>). No English trans. appeared.</note> which is a kind of sequel and completion to the other. Of this also she sends you the MS., or at least a specimen of the MS. Whether you can do anything with it is quite uncertain to me; but I wish you to examine and consider; and would not refuse this my faithful testimony on the subject, to induce you so to do.</p>
<p>Jean Paul was never yet <hi rend="italic">popular</hi> among English readers: but there is a small and increasing public to whom he irresistibly appeals; and that small, not entirely inconsiderable, and continually increasing public is withal (the excellence of the man being indisputable) a quite <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> one, in my opinion. Perhaps either for the Magazine,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>.</note> or, which would be pleasanter, for a small separate volume, you may be able to turn these papers to <pb id="pg-23-201" n="23:201"/>account? The young lady&#x2019;s style of work is as I describe it to you. Some judicious and speedy answer I can at least promise her from you.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>These two or three days I am trying to write again according to <hi rend="italic">tasks</hi> by the day; today I have already spent all my time, and cannot fulfil, except in <hi rend="italic">name</hi> merely, the purpose I rose with in the morning, that of writing to you. But one word, it can go for a penny,&#x2014;and surely it ought to be sent at that easy charge!</p>
<p>We are all pretty well; Jane herself, in spite of occasionally hard weather keeps afoot, and is at present rather hearty. I myself, keeping in great <hi rend="italic">quietness</hi>, hardly speaking to anybody once a-day, am sombre enough, and full of internal meditation and confusions, but complain fully less of bodily health than is common with me. I scribble up here in the forenoons; run out for a walk till five o&#x2019;clock; dine then (have been obliged to return to <hi rend="italic">potatoes</hi> again, whether I would or not!),&#x2014;then read all the evening till eleven o&#x2019;clock, about which hour I often make another sally for a walk of four miles; after which a pipe, a little more reading, and so at last to bed. Many of our friends are out of Town at present; so that this way of life comes quite natural. I saw Jack, the night before last; took my <hi rend="italic">night</hi> walk in company with him; he is very well and hearty.&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nota bene</hi></foreign>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> my grand new Dressing-gown is lying safe in the drawer, all this while; I wear the old one still, and indeed <hi rend="italic">old</hi> clothes generally, in this bad weather! Also I still abstain from <hi rend="italic">supper;</hi> Jane still takes a <hi rend="italic">breakfast-cup</hi> of porridge, poor thing; but I stick by my two meals and tea.</p>
<p>We have had hard frosty weather, very sharp indeed for two or three days; but it did not continue: we sink naturally into the old state of gentle <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> again, with soft west winds, and almost continual sprinklings of Scotch-mist, in which predicament we now again are for the last two days. <pb id="pg-23-202" n="23:202"/>What becomes of you, dear Mother, in these rigorous blasts! I often think how severe they will be upon you. Happily we are within sight of <hi rend="italic">spring</hi> now; tho&#x2019; still with a good deal of rude weather to be looked for first.&#x2014; Jane has discovered some astonishingly warm pairs of <hi rend="italic">drawers</hi>,&#x2014;fit apparel of women that &#x201C;wear the breeches&#x201D;;&#x2014;I really think they must be very warm; and intend, so soon as the things can be got together, to send a pair of them to Scotsbrig for you. There is hope, you see!&#x2014;</p>
<p>What Jean and James Aitken are about now we do not very clearly know; but hope they are still at Gill, as Jenny is still with you, till the Disease<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first case of cholera in Dumfries was <date when="1848-11-16">16 Nov. 1848</date>, the last in the first week in <date when="1849-01">Jan.</date>; 600 inhabitants suffered from it, of whom 317 died. In Maxwelltown, where Janet Hanning usually lived, there were 214 cases, of whom 114 died. Dr. John Sutherland found the dead lying in the street and a town council passive. His &#x201C;Report on the Epidemic Cholera of <date when="1848">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">49</date>,&#x201D; append. A to the board of health&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> (Parliamentary Papers 21 [<date when="1850">1850</date>]:185&#x2013;360), covered the Dumfries outbreak, 249&#x2013;60.</note> fairly quit Dumfries. It still goes on here; but to a very small extent, chiefly among the drinking dissipated classes; and nobody talks of it, or seems to mind it. In fact, <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi> first and last has taken ten times as many <hi rend="italic">lives</hi> here as Cholera ever did.</p>
<p>We are very sorry to hear accounts of Jamie&#x2019;s cattle threatening to perish. Has he actually <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> some of them by that murrain; or do they get better again, and only lose of their value? Tell us about it, more punctually, whoever writes next.&#x2014; Poor Mrs Buller has taken a house, and is to continue here: she is nearly 3 miles from us, which cuts her much off from Jane, greatly to her (Mrs B.&#x2019;s) regret: poor woman, you may fancy what a dreary life hers now is! Her own wretched health, chiefly <hi rend="italic">occupying</hi> her, is perhaps almost a blessing.&#x2014; Oh my dear good Mother, how gentle have the Providences been with <hi rend="italic">us!</hi> Let us be thankful;&#x2014;we are at least <hi rend="italic">glad!</hi>&#x2014; <closer><salute>My blessings to one and all. Ever your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I had not heard of the late Mr Stuart;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Stuart (<date when="1812">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">48</date>), bookseller (Ingram St.), antiquary, and historian of Glasgow, who wrote <hi rend="italic">Caledonia Romana</hi> (<date when="1848">1848</date>), various poems, and other works. He died suddenly of cholera, <date when="1848-12-24">24 Dec. 1848</date>, leaving a widow, Jane, b. Watt, with four children; she applied to the Royal Literary Fund, <date when="1849-06-04">4 June</date>, and was awarded &#xa3;60, <date when="1849-07-11">11 July</date> (case 1223).</note> nor do I at all know whether the Literary Fund, or any other such Associations here (of none of which am I a member), would be likely to accept his case as coming within their department. <pb id="pg-23-203" n="23:203"/>At any rate the assistance they can afford is very temporary and trifling. The likeliest method, it strikes me, would surely be a subscription in Glasgow itself, where this unfortunate family and their lost father are known, and have friends?&#x2014;</p>

I did not see the Veteran; but he talked long to my Wife, about things new and old (being in fact an extremely copious and ready speaker);&#x2014;among other things, he expressed a very great readiness to make acquaintance with Mr de Vere, if that Gentleman, whom he vaguely fancied to have returned to Ireland, and to be writing new Books about Irish Misdeeds,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480205-TC-ADV-01">TC to ADV, <date when="1848-02-05">5 Feb. 1848</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;would do him the honour to call, at any time.</p>
<p>Will you prefer that way, therefore? If so, it will be good to appoint a time beforehand; at least to announce it, so that Fitz<hi rend="italic">n</hi> may have time to answer No by post, if No and not Yes, on the day you announce, be inevitable for him.</p>
<p>Or would you prefer to meet him here first? If so tell us what days you can command for Chelsea, and we will endeavour to secure the ancient Son of Mars. I do wish you to know him, and to help him a little if you can:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >De Vere replied to TC, <date when="1849-01-19">19 Jan.</date>, from Mortlake, S of the Thames, ca. 5 mi.

In the mean time he thinks I had better apply to some of the authorities at the Col.

F<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to be it will be a great satisfaction to me. I shall call on him the first time I am in town.

So now I took it on my knee and kissed it and, like a fool; asked &#x201C;will you go with <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>&#x201D; I should like it very much said the Child. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">That she would</hi>&#x201D; said the Mother; &#x201C;and you need not be afraid of her misconducting herself for she is a good child&#x201C;&#x2014; I saw the thing had been taken <hi rend="italic">on the serious</hi> so I backed out of it as well as I could, &#x201C;Some time we shall see!&#x2014;when I come again <hi rend="italic">with a carriage</hi>.&#x201D; Well! ten days ago I went there again with Anthony Sterling&#x2014;and was asked gravely by the eldest daughter<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christina Letitia (Nina) Macready (<date when="1830">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850">50</date>).</note> if I &#x201C;meant to take Jane Lydia back with me&#x201D;? &#x201C;She had never ceased talking about <hi rend="italic">her visit</hi> since I had been there.&#x201D; I was in for it! so I said &#x201C;not today&#x201D;; (it was necessary to prepare C&#x2019;s mind as well as my own) &#x201C;but if her Mother would bring her any day she liked to name I should do my best with her&#x201C;&#x2014; So Saturday was named&#x2014;and the little creature delivered over to me in a transport of joy, (hardly mutual) to stay as &#x201C;long as I could be troubled to keep her&#x201C;&#x2014; I modestly suggested that three days and three nights&#x2014;just <pb id="pg-23-206" n="23:206"/>the time that Jonah was in the whale&#x2019;s belly<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jonah 1:17.</note>&#x2014;would probably be enough of it for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> as well as for me&#x2014;and the Mother went and I remained alone&#x2014;with a child of six years&#x2014;very <hi rend="italic">stirring</hi> and very small and delicate! during the first day I &#x201C;ran horses&#x201D; at her bidding, and performed my new functions with a determined energy&#x2014; &#x2014;but the night came, I durst not put her to sleep in the spare room&#x2014;for fear of her crying in the night&#x2014;and awaking M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, and being herself very miserable so after infinite perplexity in getting off her clothes (all <hi rend="italic">sewed</hi> together) I laid her in my own bed, where she soon commenced&#x2014;singing!&#x2014;after an hour&#x2019;s waiting upon her I left her still awake&#x2014;when I went up again she was asleep but lying right <hi rend="italic">accross</hi> the bed&#x2014;at twelve I placed her properly, and went into bed myself; but of course not to sleep: all night long she pitched into my breast with her active little heels&#x2014;and when she awoke at seven and threw her arms about my neck calling out &#x201C;Oh I am so glad to be here!&#x201D; I had not once closed my eyes and in this state to have to wash and dress her and play at horses again! it was a strange and severe penalty for being a Godmother&#x2014;next night I put her in the spare bed at all risks&#x2014;with a good fire and trusted in Providence&#x2014;and she did very well there&#x2014;but I had got some cold by the job and the idea of being <hi rend="italic">laid up</hi> in such a cause after having got so far thro&#x2019; the winter on foot was very vexatious so I kept the house a few days and when the childs time came Anthony Sterling took her home for me!! I have a great quantity more to tell you about this &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">go</hi>&#x201D; and other things&#x2014;but Mr C has been bothering ever since I began to write about helping him to pack a boxful of old clothes and things for Scotsbrig&#x2014;and in an hour I have to be off to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Buller so I will finish this letter to Babbie&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you all your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have hardly a moment&#x2019;s time, but must write you a word. Today I sent off by the <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Railway</hi> (not Pickford but the <hi rend="italic">shortest</hi> route) a small Bundle directed to you. It is a squarish Parcel weighing a few ounces less than a stone;&#x2014;contains some extremely warm <hi rend="italic">woollen</hi> articles, that I told you of,&#x2014;there are two pair of <hi rend="italic">drawers</hi>, but only one <hi rend="italic">jacket;</hi> Jane says nobody can wear the jacket <hi rend="italic">permanently</hi>, or except it be very hard frost. There is also some trifle for Isabella, and a small Book for Grahame. <pb id="pg-23-207" n="23:207"/>Whatsoever is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> directed at all, is of course meant for you.&#x2014; Pray make some of them write so soon as the Parcel gets to hand; I understand it is safer <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to pay the carriage here; therefore, if I find it so, I will not pay it today at the Office: but I want to know from you exactly what it is,&#x2014;do not forget to tell me that, for it is really a debt of mine, whoever may pay it for the present.&#x2014; There is also a poor little Book for you; I hoped to have got one worthier yesterday, which I had my eye on; but on going to look after it, a purchaser had been already there.&#x2014; &#x2014; Tell me if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> wear the jacket comfortably, and we will remember to get another; they are not ill to get.</p>
<p>We are tolerably well in health, all of us: Jane has gone out today to see Mrs Buller; John was here last night. There is a smell of Spring already in the air; and the weather is really wonderful for the season,&#x2014;whenever the Western misty rains, and warm <hi rend="italic">mud</hi>, clear up for a little while.</p>
<p>Jack brought us a letter from Scotsbrig the other night, and one from Dumfries; which gave us great satisfaction.&#x2014; Did Jamie ever get a Book (on <hi rend="italic">Husbandry</hi> or some such thing, by one <hi rend="italic">Coleman</hi>)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Colman (<date when="1785">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">1849</date>), American Unitarian minister and agricultural writer, who spent three and a half years in Britain studying agricultural conditions; for his agricultural books, see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430529-TC-JAC-01"><sic>16:186</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1843-05-29">29 May 1843</date></corr></ref>. He had returned to the United States but came back to die in London, <date when="1849-08-19">19 Aug.</date></note> which <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> sent him some time ago? She wants much to know. <closer><salute>Good b&#x2019;ye, dear Mother; I will write again before long. Ever your affectionate&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

On Thursday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1849-02-01">1 Feb.</date></note> if the gods permit, I will have tea at Bath House.

<p>I am quite shivery and unwell, these several days;&#x2014;shamefully sensitive, I fancy, to the chill damp winds, and to other unfavourable influences.

Patience; at least, silence.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; I have fairly given up my desperate enterprises of writing, for the present; in my actual mood it will not do.

Elizabeth.</note> came to London two years ago (!) was slowly but surely melting away, although he did what he could to eke it out by writing sermons for preachers who could not compose them at first hand.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maccall denied this: &#x201C;I should feel it to be degrading to be a hack for anything, or in anything; and I should deem it dishonourable to prostitute my pen in matters the most sacred.&#x201D;</note> When he first came here he was within ten pounds of starvation, still, however, keeping up the appearance of a gentleman. Mr. C. exerted himself for him in several directions&#x2014;wrote to Lady A.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ashburton. Maccall wrote that he &#x201C;did not press my affairs&#x201D; on TC, &#x201C;but he made many and sympathetic inquiries respecting them, and showed every disposition to be amiable to me.&#x201D;</note> about him, &#x26;c., &#x26;c., but all without result. One day Mrs. Macready applied to me for a private teacher for one of the boys too nervous to be sent to a public school. I recollected M. as likely to suit, though teaching was not his calling, and Mr. C. wrote a letter in his <pb id="pg-23-216" n="23:216"/>praise to Mrs. M., and after communicating with Mr. M. in America, M. was engaged by them three weeks ago to teach the little boy two hours a day, at a salary of &#xa3;65 a year.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maccall wrote: &#x201C;The little boy Henry Macready to whom Mrs. Carlyle alludes I taught not two but three times a day, and I received not &#xa3;65, but &#xa3;60 a year. Henry was a gifted, affectionate, interesting child. But his extreme instability and wild imaginativeness made the training and the teaching of the boy one of the hardest tasks I ever undertook, so that my remuneration could scarcely be deemed excessive, especially as, contrary to Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s declaration, tuition was not unfamiliar to me.&#x201D; Henry Macready was epileptic.</note> They are so liberal always, these darling Macreadys! I was glad to have helped to put him in a way of keeping soul and body together. Well! on Thursday night of last week he came to tea, as he was in the practice of doing at long intervals, but asking at the door if we were alone was told by Helen &#x201C;Yes, but not expecting visitors.&#x201D; Whereupon he turned to go away, saying he would come back another time, and Helen, with her usual extraordinary want of tact, instead of letting him go, said, &#x201C;Stop till I tell Mr. Carlyle,&#x201D; and rushed in upon Mr. C. just risen from the sofa, where he had been sleeping, cross as people are with after-dinner sleeps, and bothered with the prospect of having to entertain a certain&#x2014;&#x2014;from Manchester, whom we had invited to tea at the request of G&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julie Salis Schwabe and Geraldine Jewsbury.</note> You know his horror of having to speak to different sorts of people at one time; this, in the mood he was in, was enough to make him forget that M. was poor, very proud and sensitive, as poor men of unrecognized genius are apt to be, and anxious to avoid the complication, he answered her question &#x201C;Was Mr. M. to come in?&#x201D; with a sharp, &#x201C;Say I am engaged, and hope he will return soon.&#x201D; Which message I heard at the top of the stairs with a shudder, for I felt how the man would interpret it into unwillingness to produce him before one&#x2019;s fine people. My first impulse (always the best) was to run downstairs and let it go no further, and insist on Mr. M. coming in. But I hesitated in fear of the sour looks and after-scold, and in the moment of hesitation the man was dismissed to walk back four miles! That was Thursday. On Tuesday morning Mr. C. received a letter from an unknown individual at B.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bolton.</note> (the native place of M.&#x2019;s wife) to the effect that &#x201C;understanding Mr. C. had been some time acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">the late</hi> Mr. M, the writer would be greatly obliged by some particulars of his sudden death, which he had just heard from M.&#x2019;s mother-in-law.&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Haselden.</note> You may figure the shock! There was more in it for me than a sudden death of an amiable, clever man. A horrible suspicion darted through my mind&#x2014;had he committed suicide?&#x2014;perhaps that night he had come in an emergency to ask some favour of the only man he thought his friend, and he was <pb id="pg-23-217" n="23:217"/>turned away because there were visitors&#x2014;was not this enough to sting such a sensitive creature to the quick? Might it not have been the last drop in his cup of bitterness that made it run over and spill his life? I would not suggest this horror to Mr. C.; but I saw that something of the sort was in his own mind, and that doubled my apprehension. I must be off to see into the thing, to help the poor widow with money at least. C. encouraged me to go. Darwin had appointed to drive me to the Pantheon<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Oxford St., a bazaar for fancy goods.</note> that day&#x2014;after a basket. I could not wait his time. I would go up to him in the omnibus, and get him to drive me to the street near &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; square<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carburton St., nr. Fitzroy Sq.</note> where the unfortunate man had lived. To lose no time, before starting I wrote a hurried note to Lady A., telling what had happened, sure that she would offer money for the widow. Darwin was shocked at my story. He begged as a kindness to be told how much money I should like given. At least I hoped to get her provided for. And with this one clear idea in my head we drove to the house, the belief of a suicide gaining on me all the way. At the door I felt so physically sick that I could hardly get out of the carriage. I knocked myself very softly, and was opened to by a stupid servant girl. I asked, &#x201C;How is Mrs. M.?&#x201D; &#x201C;As well as could be expected.&#x201D; &#x201C;I wish to see her,&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;Will you take me to her at once? If you ask she may refuse, as I am an entire stranger to her, and I must see her.&#x201D; The girl stared. &#x201C;But Mrs. M. is gone!&#x201D; &#x201C;What! gone for good? to B&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;?&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh no; she is only gone a little way to buy mournings.&#x201D; &#x201C;Mercy of Heaven!&#x201D; I thought, there are women whom the skies falling could not drive from their &#x201C;three thousand punctualities.&#x201D; But I was not going to be turned back by my romantic disgust, the woman might need money all the same, all the more indeed. Meanwhile, how should I put any question on what so much of my peace really depended. &#x201C;Now, in what manner did your master die?&#x201D; While I hesitated the girl said, coolly, &#x201C;But Mr. M. is in the house; you may see him.&#x201D; I positively staggered as if a pistol had been fired into me&#x2014;she could never mean the body. Yet these London lower orders are so fond of showing bodies, or was it a father or brother come up to bury him. I durst not let myself go to the hope that the man was alive after all. &#x201C;Take me to him,&#x201D; I gasped out, and followed her upstairs into a poor bare, clean little room where a pretty child sat writing at a table, and behind it stood the dead man as alive as could be. I did not throw my arms round his neck and cover him with kisses&#x2014;rather a wonder, you will say. I merely clasped my hands together and cried out, &#x201C;Oh my God: I am so glad?&#x201D; and then burst into tears.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maccall wrote: &#x201C;That &#x2026; the door was once shut in my face when I went to Cheyne-row I do not remember. I am convinced that if this great misfortune did really befall me, it did not excite any suicidal thoughts. &#x2026; There is a large amount of the mythical in Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s account of her visit to my lodgings. &#x2026; First of all, for the sake of dramatic effect it was indispensable to represent the lodgings as of the humblest kind. &#x2026; Secondly, the servant had to be pictured as stupid, which assuredly she was not. Lastly, a dialogue between this stupid servant and the clever Mrs. Carlyle was needful to enrich the drama. Now this dialogue was impossible, because my wife &#x2026; never told the servant what she was about to do when she went out. &#x2026; The bare, hard prose of the affair is that Mrs. Carlyle the moment she arrived, was shown up to my sitting-room; that I was playing with my little girl when she came in; that the surprise and the shock of finding me alive threw Mrs. Carlyle into a sort of hysterical excitement. The first words she uttered &#x2026; were: &#x2018;You must think I am drunk.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> If you just try to conceive the sudden revulsion of feeling you will <pb id="pg-23-218" n="23:218"/>not find this very silly. The man&#x2019;s stupefaction I shall never forget; he evidently thought me gone mad, for he said soothingly, &#x201C;Mrs. Carlyle! how are you? I hope you are quite well.&#x201D; I sat down and took out my cry, unable to give any more detailed explanation than in broken words, &#x201C;They wrote you were dead. I came to comfort your wife.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh, not at all, I assure you. I am very well, thank you, very well.&#x201D; &#x201C;But your mother-in-law said you were dead!&#x201D;</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your old Cromwell Document must go somewhere into the Third Edition. Would you have the goodness to compare this copy of it for me with the Original;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cromwell and ten others of the Cambridge Committee to the deputy lieuts. of Suffolk, <date when="1645-06-06">6 June 1645</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:209&#x2013;10. TC noted that it is &#x201C;now (<date when="1849-01">Jan. 1849</date>) the property of John Wodderspoon, Esq., Mercury Office, Norwich.&#x201D;</note> and see whether among my guesses and observations you find anything to object to.</p>
<p>Edm &#x2018;Leland&#x2019; (the undecipherable name), I have guessed (in the absence of all help, even of Rushworth for the present) to be Edm Bacon (Sir Edmond, a known Suffolk man<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wodderspoon replied, <date when="1849-02-04">4 Feb.</date>, that he was now employed at the <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi> (since <date when="1848-11">Nov. 1848</date>) and that this would account for his delay in answering TC&#x2019;s letter, evidently addressed to Ipswich. He describes the original as blotted and says that he cannot read the name. As printed by TC, the letter is signed by eleven names, ending with &#x201C;ED&#x2014;&#x2014; (illegible).&#x201D; The reference to John Rushworth is to his <hi rend="italic">Historical Collections</hi> (<date when="1701">1701</date>) 4:pt.1:38, which has a similar letter from the Cambridge committee, signed by twenty names, including &#x201C;ED&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D; and eight others listed in TC&#x2019;s printed letter but without Cromwell (&#x201C;probably now gone on other business&#x201D;). TC cites as his source Rushworth (<date when="1701">1701</date>) 6:36&#x2013;38. He may have guessed it was Sir Edmund Bacon because Bacon was one of the Cambridge committee specified by TC in the heading of Cromwell&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1643-07-31">31 July 1643</date> (<hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:153&#x2013;56).</note>):&#x2014;pray try whether it will not read so?</p>
<p>Further, is there on the Paper any mark, or evidence elsewhere, that it was addressed &#x2018;To the <hi rend="italic">Corporation</hi> of Ipswich&#x2019;?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC noted that the original was &#x201C;long stationary at Ipswich.&#x201D;</note> In that form I cannot make satisfactory sense of it,&#x2014;and guess that it must have been to the general <hi rend="italic">Committee for Suffolk County</hi>,&#x2014;the rather as I find that warnings went off, that day, from Cambridge, to &#x2018;all Counties of the Association,&#x2019; to rendezvous with their Horse and Foot immediately:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Committees of the Associations of several counties, founded <date when="1642">1642</date> for defense against royalists, see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:128.</note>&#x2014;Oliver Cromwell, next week, <hi rend="italic">rode</hi> with the Horse, and did memorable service with them, on Naseby Field!</p>
<p>And please do not forget to <hi rend="italic">return</hi> the Paper.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC prefaces: &#x201C;Here is an old Piece of Paper still surviving; still emblematic of old dead days and their extinct agitations, when once we get to decipher it&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:209).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>I have not much to say about the Reading-room and Catalogues; the Museum is a place I never go to, and never think of, except on compulsion; and for above a year back I have hardly, either in body or idea, been there at all.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; But if the Commission requires my testimony, I am bound to give it; and will, with all the fidelity I can.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1847">1847</date> Parliament had established a royal commission on the management of the British Museum which would seek suggestions for improvement.

<p>&#x201C;To believe unwisely and disbelieve unwisely,&#x201C;&#x2014;this, in far more important cases than the <hi rend="italic">Squire</hi> one, is the most flagrant summary a man can give of what &#x201C;want of wisdom generally&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Excerpts from Fox, which I return. They prove indisputably, if proof were wanting, that Oliver by &#x201C;Friends&#x201D; in that sentence <pb id="pg-23-222" n="23:222"/>means &#x201C;Quakers,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Fox&#x2019;s meetings with Cromwell, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 8:224&#x2013;25 and 9:199&#x2013;200. Cromwell&#x2019;s reference to &#x201C;Friends&#x201D; is untraced.</note> or the miscellaneous anarchic rabble of whom Quakers were the topmost developement, and most conspicuous outcome, at that time. What else can he rationally be <hi rend="italic">supposed</hi> to mean!</p>
<p>I am busy just now getting ready a Third Edition of <hi rend="italic">Oliver;</hi> with which I have more bother by far than I had expected. There are some 4 or five insignificant new Fractions, contributed since last time,&#x2014;properly of no <hi rend="italic">value</hi> at all, for they alter nothing in the view given of Oliver&#x2019;s work or character;&#x2014;and every one of them is a dark, rusty, sooty clump, which I have got to clean, and stick into the wall somewhere, which is already built without them! For no man known to me in History would I willingly take so much trouble, except for Oliver alone.</p>
<p>Of public affairs I try to think as little as I can: at all moments there dwells with me the fatal presentment, that unless taken in hand by quite other kinds of men, with quite other kinds of management (of which at present there seems no hope), all things are rapidly plunging towards total Downbreak, street-barricades, Chartist Parliament, and one knows not what.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Revolutionary street barricades had been set up in practically all the chief continental cities in <date when="1848">1848</date>. Though Chartist power declined in <date when="1848">1848</date>, Chartists were tried in London and Edinburgh in <date when="1848-10">Oct.</date> and <date when="1848-11">Nov.</date>, and in <date when="1848-12">Dec.</date> at Chester, Liverpool, and York.</note> The thought of which makes me quite unable to throw up my Cap round Cobden and his Budget agitations,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At a meeting of 6,000 persons in Manchester Free Trade Hall, <date when="1849-01-10">10 Jan.</date>, Cobden argued for a reduction of &#xa3;10 million in the govt.&#x2019;s budget by reducing expenditure to that of <date when="1835">1835</date> and for a more equitable and economical system of taxation. His main argument was for cutting military expenditure and adding the money saved to civil expenditure. He continued his campaign at a Free Trade dinner in Manchester, <date when="1849-01-31">31 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Our warlike establishments cost us more every year now than a war cost us in the middle of last century&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1849-02-01">1 Feb.</date>). When he presented his proposals to Parliament, <date when="1849-02-26">26 Feb.</date>, they were defeated. Milnes notes in his commonplace book, ca. <date when="1849">1849</date>, that TC spoke of Cobden as &#x201C;an inspired bagman who believes in a calico millenium. He is always praising America to me. I said to him, &#x2018;What have the Americans done but beget, with unexampled rapidity, twenty millions of the greatest bores on the face of the earth&#x2019;&#x201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:436).</note> and indeed keeps me quite unhappy in these late months. Alas, I have only a <hi rend="italic">tongue;</hi>&#x2014;and I must decide to <hi rend="italic">hold</hi> that, till I can endure no longer!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Mrs Carlyle returns you kind regards; is pretty well; indeed, has been better this Winter than for a good many past. Run over to us some time soon, when you are in the City.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>Is he gone yet?&#x2014;are you at leisure to listen to me? for I have today actually something to tell! I have had a visit which threw me into perfect&#x2014;or to speak quite veraciously&#x2014;into <hi rend="italic">comparitive</hi> beatitude for several hours&#x2014;guess from whom!&#x2014;but you never could come within a hundred miles of her!&#x2014;for it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a <hi rend="small-caps">her</hi>&#x2014; So I must just tell you&#x2014;I have had a visit&#x2014;indeed <hi rend="italic">two</hi> visits from&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Anthony Sterling!!&#x2014; I cannot tell you how it pleased me to be no longer, however unintentionally, a cause of misery to that poor woman!&#x2014; She came voluntarily &#x201C;would have come long ago if she could have believed I would receive her.&#x201D; Nothing could be more beautiful than her behaviour&#x2014;she came alone&#x2014;stopt &#x201C;on the mat&#x201D; (Helen said) until I said she might come in, and then came forward with meek and brave words of apology&#x2014;which you may be sure I cut short with kisses&#x2014; Poor Soul I almost fainted myself from putting myself into her situation&#x2014; I begin to think I must have some sympathy after all&#x2014; She said I &#x201C;must be <hi rend="italic">an angel</hi> to receive her as I did after her conduct&#x201C;&#x2014;but it was <hi rend="italic">she</hi> who was the angel this time&#x2014;I in her place could not have gone thro the thing as well as she did&#x2014;and after all what had I to forgive her poor woman?&#x2014;the suffering to <hi rend="italic">herself</hi> which attended her mistake about <hi rend="italic">me</hi> was proof enough of its <hi rend="italic">involuntariness</hi>&#x2014;Oh dont I know what she has suffered?&#x2014;too hard punishment for her error of judgement!&#x2014; That was Saturday, I had received a note from Anthony on the morning telling me not to be surprised if she came&#x2014;but there had been some talk of the same thing before&#x2014;and it ended in smoke&#x2014;so I could hardly expect her till the carriage drove up&#x2014;had just thought it so far possible as to put myself into a cap and shawl to make out a decided case of <hi rend="italic">an old woman!</hi>&#x2014;for her better assurance in case she <hi rend="italic">did</hi> come.&#x2014; Would any mortal have thought of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> but myself?&#x2014; Of course I did all I could to raise her up in her own esteem again and make her aware that she had not sunk but infinitely risen in mine&#x2014; I wrote her the most encouraging letter, after, that I could invent&#x2014;to meet the reaction which I feared would follow her magnanimous act&#x2014; And she has answered it so sweetly. Today she came again&#x2014;with Anthony to get me to go to Hedly for a few days&#x2014;&#x201C;She would not believe I had quite forgiven her <pb id="pg-23-224" n="23:224"/>till I came to Hedly&#x2014; Perhaps I will go&#x2014; I would do anything to help her with her life&#x2014;but it looks a sad mess to me&#x2014; Anthony and she grate on each other like a couple of files&#x2014;she proud and petulant towards <hi rend="italic">him</hi> and he cold and contradictory towards <hi rend="italic">Her</hi>&#x2014;since seeing them together this morning I almost despair of ever being able to make them better friends&#x2014; But I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> great influence over <hi rend="italic">him</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> sort&#x2014;and I will <hi rend="italic">get</hi> influence over her too or the devil is in it&#x2014;seeing I have set my heart on reconciling them&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>On Sunday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1849-02-04">4 Feb.</date></note> the sublime Mason had announced to me a Box of Cigars,</p>
<p>ordered to be sent, about which the <hi rend="italic">way</hi> was to be enquired into: on Sunday Evening, after leaving you, I got the Box from his Excellency on the stairs; carried it home in my own hired democratic vehicle; and here it now is. A most acceptable, friendly and truly useful Gift. May your shadow never be less! The Cigars are of known excellence; such a quantity, of such a quality, may justly excite thankfulness in the narcotic mind. I shall often remember you, in my most meditative moments, for a long while to come.</p>
<p>Furthermore there arrived yesterday morning this Letter from Emerson; which I now inclose, hoping it may quicken the Drummond hunt after that lost &#xa3;50, and speedily now lead to the capture of the same, <hi rend="italic">here</hi> being the <pb id="pg-23-225" n="23:225"/>right scent for the hounds.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton had cashed a bank draft for TC from Abraham Hart, of Carey &#x26; Hart and had apparently lost the draft; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18481206-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1848-12-06">6 Dec.</date></ref> In answer to TC&#x2019;s inquiring what had happened to it, Emerson wrote, <date when="1849-01-23">23 Jan.</date>, that Hart had found, &#x201C;in his account with Brown Shipley &#x26; Co., T. Carlyle&#x2019;s draft for &#xa3;50, payable in <date when="1846-04">April 1846</date>, charged to Carey &#x26; Hart, as accepted, <date when="1845-12-02">Dec. 2, 1845</date>&#x201D;; so Brown Shipley &#x26; Co. could explain &#x201C;to whom they paid the money.&#x201D; Drummond is Henry Drummond&#x2019;s banking house.</note> American Hart, it would seem, has <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> the money; Shipley &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of Liverpool, who undertook to answer all comers on that subject, have, I suppose, never been <hi rend="italic">applied to;</hi> and with them it rests. Pray stir in the matter; and let us get it conquered and ended. If the Draft be even lost, Hart of Philadelphia is still extant acknowledging the debt as due at that time; and if Shipley and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> have not paid to <hi rend="italic">anybody</hi>, let them now pay it,&#x2014;the Drummonds must be fully equal to saying <hi rend="italic">how.</hi> And so let us despatch, and happily finish at length!</p>
 <p>I enclose also, by way of literary specimen, a Letter that came from Squire yesterday; who a little shudders at the promise he made me in regard to Peterboro Cathedral;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Squire&#x2019;s letter from Gt. Yarmouth, <date when="1849-02-04">4 Feb.</date> At the top TC wrote: &#x201C;Do not burn: Keep for me&#x201D;; and at the end: &#x201C;first Letter: Cover gone;&#x2014; / L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> had it&#x2014;.&#x201D; Squire had visited Cheyne Row, <date when="1849-01-23">23 Jan.</date>, this being the first time that the two men had met, and Squire had promised to send TC &#x201C;one little fragment relating to the &#x2018;sack of Peterboro Cathedral&#x2019; he had <hi rend="italic">copied</hi> from his ancestor&#x2019;s journal long ago,&#x201D; with &#x201C;a speech of Cromwell&#x2019;s [given] to Squire (&#x2018;line or two of copied writing&#x2019;) on their first entrance into Cambridge on <hi rend="italic">military</hi> people.&#x201D; The MS of TC&#x2019;s account of the interview with Squire is in the Bancroft Lib., Univ. of Calif., Berkeley, pbd.

<p>Many sincere thanks for your strenuous inquiry, and victorious discovery, concerning the &#x201C;Young Baron&#x201D; Wharton!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490202-TC-TW-01">TC to TW, <date when="1849-02-02">2 Feb.</date></ref></note> It is a real spark of luminous matter added to the great Night of British History;&#x2014;one small item truly worth remembering amid the boundless continents of dark rubbish which men keep jumbling to and fro, and pretending to remember; and which they had better at once honestly <hi rend="italic">forget</hi>, there being in them, except for Pedant and Dryasdust purposes, nothing that is, or can be made, intrinsically memorable. I have secured the little Note; and its illumination, true so far as it goes, may shine henceforth. Many thanks to you.</p>
<p>We will not disturb ourselves with Bear Park any further; indeed I suspect Lilburn never lived there; and must have got but a slender account of rents themselves, during those troublous ten years.</p>
<p>I had heard of the Pamphlet about the old Newspaper;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A Letter to Antonio Panizzi, Esq.</hi> (<date when="1839">1839</date>), exposing the fabrication of the alleged first English newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">English Mercurie</hi> of 1588.

His &#x201C;Hammond Letters,&#x201D; at all events, seem to me, for many reasons, to be quite out of the range of suspicion.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Birch (<date when="1705">1705</date>&#x2013;<date when="1766">66</date>), clergyman and ed. of historical documents, enjoyed the patronage of the Hardwicke family.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Tomorrow you will receive back the Books you lent me, for the Bath-House people,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons.</note> long ago; I am to call there, and set them under way this afternoon. They have been <hi rend="italic">unconscionably</hi> kept;&#x2014;ought not my gratitude to be great in proportion? Verily I do recognise how polite, friendly, and every way obliging and human the man is; and will not lose it quite out of memory, this long while!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But the thing to be said now is, that you must bid Henry compare this arrival of Books with the <hi rend="italic">list</hi> of those sent; and if there is any discrepancy or mistake, let me <hi rend="italic">have warning immediately;</hi> for the family are still at The Grange where the Books were, and till the end of this week any mistake can be <hi rend="italic">rectified;</hi> a thing which would not be so easy afterwards.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster replied, <date when="1849-02-07">7 Feb.</date>, that Rawlins had found a book missing from the batch returned from the Ashburtons.</note> So look to it, pray. If I hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, I shall think it all right: that is the briefest rule.</p>
<p>Alas, there was nothing for &#x201C;Levy&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Someone from Levey, Robson, &#x26; Franklyn, 46 St. Martin&#x2019;s Lane, TC&#x2019;s printers.</note> when he called; nor, I fear, will there ever be in th<supplied>[at?]</supplied> form! Meanwhile I have taken to tinkering <hi rend="italic">Cromwell:</hi> the rest will, and must, follow when its time comes, if I learn<supplied>[?]</supplied> to see that. Courage!&#x2014; By the bye, did I tell you I have seen&#x2014;&#x201C;W. Squire!&#x201D; Himself, in person; a much bruised, more than half-distracted, but courageous, exasperated, veridical man.&#x2014;You must come, and hear all this, and more, <foreign><hi rend="italic">quam primum</hi></foreign> [as soon as possible].<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster wrote that &#x201C;Milnes amazed me by [naming] Squire in full council at the [London] library the other day&#x2014;I protesting (God forgive me!) that I knew of no such man. &#x2026; As you say I must go over &#x26; hear all about it.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>May I still trouble you with two small inquiries respecting those Cromwell Letters you lately published.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480318-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1848-03-18">18 March 1848</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480607-TC-DT-01">TC to DT, <date when="1848-06-07">7 June 1848</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>1. In p. 47 (of your Norwich Pamphlet), where the <hi rend="italic">Sir John&#x2019;s</hi> sirname has been erased,&#x2014;could you help me to a guess how many <hi rend="italic">letters</hi> may have been in the said sirname? You give <hi rend="italic">five asterisks;</hi> but whether that means five obliterated letters or not, I do not know,&#x2014;nor whether you are pretty <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> of there being 5, or rather doubtful in your guess.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:221&#x2013;24. TC says: &#x201C;In the original the <hi rend="italic">surname</hi> of the &#x2018;Sir John&#x2019; to whom the Letter addresses itself has been &#x2026; so industriously crossed out with many strokes of the pen, that not only is it entirely illegible, but the polite possessor of the Autograph cannot undertake to guess for me how many letters may have been in the word. On other grounds I pretty confidently undertake, nevertheless, to read <hi rend="italic">Wray:</hi> Sir John Wray of Glentworth, Member for Lincolnshire, and on the Committee of that County&#x201D; (6:221). The word is spelled &#x201C;sirname&#x201D; in the MS.</note> Pray inform me; for the name, I believe, is otherwise discoverable, and this will be a help.</p>
<p>2.&#x2014;p. 58, middle of the page, contains these words, in which the sense is somewhat confused for me:&#x2014; &#x2014; &#x2014; &#x201C;value to the State, (this <hi rend="italic">point</hi>?) if the gentleman stand clear in your judgements. (and this?)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The punctuation points in question are the comma following &#x201C;State&#x201D; and the period following &#x201C;judgements,&#x201D; which TC has circled in pencil.</note> I beg it as a special&#x201C;&#x2014;. &#x2014;Could you be so kind as give me the exact punctuation of the original:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:174: &#x201C;value of him to the State. If the Gentleman stand clear in your judgments,&#x2014;I.&#x201D;</note> I shall then see whether the confusion lies in Cromwell&#x2019;s self or not.</p>
<p>I think you already assured me that all those Four Letters were <hi rend="italic">Autograph;</hi> in Cromwell&#x2019;s own hand? Except for what you say at p. 42 about &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">establishing</hi> their originality,&#x201D; my recollection on this point would have been (as indeed it <hi rend="italic">virtually</hi> is) quite certain.</p>
<p>Pray excuse this trouble. I am on a Third Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the Book on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, and must not omit these interesting new Documents.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I let the time slip away till it was too late; but I must not neglect again today. On Thursday Night, the Scotsbrig Package was delivered safe here; a most swift passage, just a day later than Isabella&#x2019;s Letter: the cost of carriage 7/6; and all was right and uninjured. I took the Doctor<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle.</note> his brand new Plaid, round my own shoulders, over to him that night; the Hams are still here unbroken, his one waiting for a convenient hour. We tried the Potatoes; found them wonderfully good; better far than any we could ever get here, except one small lot, which, among the continual fluctuations, had once turned up for us. Thanks, thanks! My own six pairs of capital stockings,&#x2014;my dear good Mother, I cannot tell you how they have affected me. Ever as of old you are busy for my behoof; doing what you can, be it more or less, with true heart and willing hand: surely of all the stockings in this world, none could be welcomer to me than these are! Excellent stockings in themselves too; fit altogether well; and will keep me warm, and remind me thankfully of you for many a day to come.&#x2014; The other set were not nearly done yet: but I will now look out the bad ones, and put them off duty, till there is an opportunity of sending them away.</p>
<p>You must very pointedly thank Isabella for us too (whose care in writing Letters, and in all punctual things, is always much and justly valued by us): <pb id="pg-23-231" n="23:231"/>so soon as a certain piece of Fife Bacon, which came from Walter Welsh, is finished, Jane, I can see clearly, will make no delay in breaking into this Scotsbrig Ham; for that is one of the few things she cares much about, and indeed it often seems to form her main sustenance at breakfast, the bread she eats being wondrously small in quantity. Thanks, and again thanks to you and to Jamie, and to all the kind friends that never forget us at Scotsbrig!</p>
<p>I am still working at the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell;</hi> and have not yet decided when the Bookseller<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall. On <date when="1849-02-14">14 Feb.</date>, TC signed a receipt: &#x201C;Received of Mess<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Chapman &#x26; Hall the Sum of One Hundred pounds being the consideration for an edition of 1250 copies of &#x2018;Sartor Resartus&#x2019; printed by them&#x2014;no other edition to be printed till that is sold. / &#xa3;100 / Thomas Carlyle&#x201D; (MS: Pierpont Morgan Lib.). Only the signature is by TC.</note> is to be stirred up to print. It is a quiet <hi rend="italic">canny</hi> job I have at present; but a good deal <hi rend="italic">more of</hi> it than I expected, every addition, never so trifling, costing a good deal of trouble. I am making no change worth speaking of: I find that the Book is well liked, and silently making its way into the heart of the country: which is a result I am very thankful for.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday I had rather an agitated Three Hours: I was called before a thing they call a Royal Commission, to give testimony about the Library of the British Museum. Having many <hi rend="italic">faults</hi> to find, I had much rather have held my tongue; but would not, the clear call <hi rend="italic">being</hi> to open it. Open it accordingly I did; and told the noble Lords and others, in strenuous <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> phraseology, a good mouthful of my mind,&#x2014;which seemed to amaze them considerably, even to <hi rend="italic">frighten</hi> certain of them (who tried to bear me down, but made nothing of that), and at last I think to enlist certain of them in my favour, and produce some feeling in their idle minds, that here was a devil of a curious fellow, who seemed to have some <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> on his side!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Appearing before the commission, TC spoke of the lack of public libraries in England and emphasized two major deficiences of the British Museum library&#x2014;the lack of a printed subject catalogue and the lack of convenient reading space. &#x201C;I have seen it stated,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;that in the island of Iceland a man has a better chance of getting books out of the public resources than we have. I believe every Icelander, when he comes to Kiekianik [Reykjavik; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400626-TC-AC-01"><sic>12:174&#x2013;75</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1840-06-26">26 June 1840</date></corr></ref>] to sell his year&#x2019;s produce of stock-fish or whatever else, gets a number of books, by order of the King of Denmark, out of the library there, and carries them home to read in his own house in the winter-time; a privilege that no Englishman has at all. &#x2026; I believe there are in Germany some 400 great libraries &#x2026; free to the public &#x2026;; but we have only one library&#x2014;the one in the British Museum&#x2014;and yet this is the richest and largest empire in the world.&#x201D; As for a catalogue, without one &#x201C;for all practical purposes this Collection of ours might as well have been locked up in water-tight chests and sunk on the Dogger-bank, as put into the British Museum.&#x201D; As for the reading room then in use, &#x201C;It has very bad ventilation; the atmosphere is very bad. &#x2026; I have gone into that room when it has been quite crowded, and therefore has been no seat vacant, and I have been obliged to sit on the step of a ladder: and there are such a bustle and confusion &#x2026; that I never do enter the room without getting a headach&#x2014;what I call the Museum headach&#x2014;and there I avoid the room till the last extremity&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Inquire into the Constitution and Government of the British Museum with Minutes of Evidence</hi>, Thurs., <date when="1849-02-08">8 Feb. 1849</date>, 322&#x2013;35).</note> The accused official parties sat by; especially one big blustering <pb id="pg-23-232" n="23:232"/>Half-Quack (not entirely a bad fellow either) whom I have long had my eye on:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prodded by Milnes, TC identified Panizzi as the librarian with whom he was &#x201C;not acquainted&#x201D; but through whom he might have been provided with a private reading area, had he been deferential in seeking the favor. For other members of staff TC had only praise, singling out Thomas Watts as &#x201C;most obliging and intelligent&#x201D; (329).</note> he could make next to no defence, tho&#x2019; he tried hard; I am really almost sorry for him now, poor blockhead, now that I have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> his <foreign>dittay</foreign> [indictment] given him!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Turning his attention to a new edn. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, TC had been particularly distressed by the lack of organization of the King&#x2019;s Pamphlets in the museum library. He had written to John Bruce in <date when="1848-11">Nov. 1848</date> about possible publication of a catalogue, and Bruce had responded enthusiastically, <date when="1848-11-15">15 Nov. 1848</date>: &#x201C;It is as clear as day light that it ought to be adopted. &#x2026; Help from the Camden Society, or any other Society that I know any thing about, is not to be obtained. The answer from them will be&#x2014;that it does not come within their purpose.&#x201D; There will soon be hearings by the commissioners appointed to investigate the British Museum, he said: &#x201C;At that time, I would suggest to you, bring forward this proposal. Let it speak for itself, and connected &#x2026; with many large questions which must be discussed, it is not unlikely to be successful. If it is not successful in that way, &#x2026; if you would contribute a preface, a bookseller might be found to print a small edition. I will cheerfully do the small work of Editor.&#x201D; Espinasse says that TC &#x201C;drew up a Memorial, addressed to the Trustees &#x2026; of the British Museum, strongly urging them to have that catalogue [of the King&#x2019;s Pamphlets] printed. He showed me the Memorial, which has never been published&#x201D; (87). John Bruce wrote, <date when="1849-02-23">23 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;I &#x2026; suggest to you to have your Mem<hi rend="italic">l</hi> about the Cat. of King&#x2019;s Pamphlets printed as a supplement to your evidence before the Brit. Mus. Commission. The cost of merely transcribing the Catalogue for a printer, would I find be &#xa3;40.10&#x2014; This is rather a heavy item to stand at the head of an Estimate to propose to a bookseller.&#x201D; On <date when="1849-03-22">22 March</date>, Bruce to TC: &#x201C;I have sent the Memorial to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Milnes as you requested.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>The worst was, it flurried my nerves a good deal; not a <hi rend="italic">wholesome</hi> kind of thing at all! However, we are going, Jane and I, out to the Country, some 20 miles off, to Ant<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Sterling&#x2019;s place for 4 days on Tuesday next: fresh air, quiet and a good ride or two will set us up somewhat. Alas, the Paper is ended, and I must not begin another. <hi rend="italic">Continue</hi> &#x201C;well,&#x201D; dear Mother, continue!&#x2014; I will write again from Sterling&#x2019;s probably. <closer><salute>Blessings on all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We came down here on Tuesday last, according to promise; we were to have returned today, and Jane accordingly <hi rend="italic">is</hi> on the way home at this moment; but by a new arrangement, which seemed to suit all parties better, she is to return tomorrow, along with &#x201C;the Captain&#x201D; (our good landlord here), and our stay, in the fine clear country weather, is to continue till <hi rend="italic">Monday.</hi> So it was settled, after debate this morning. Cap<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Sterling (Anthony, as we call him) is required to be up in Town today; but wishes greatly he had some excuse for coming back; so Jane is off in the carriage with him too; will have a look at Helen and Chelsea, a good wholesome drive withal;&#x2014;and I here am left lord of the mansion till they come back; with the prospect, which is not disagreeable to me, of four-and-twenty hours <hi rend="italic">perfect silence</hi> for one thing. An old Scotch servant woman readies me a little dinner; there is a horse for a ride; a pleasant fresh country all round: and what with my books, and my <hi rend="italic">pipe</hi>, and my own thoughts I calculate I shall do very well till they come back to me.</p>
<p>Already I feel very much improved in health by these three days of country. I have gone out, and had extensive rides every day; the <date when="--02">february</date> sun is bright, the ground (which all lies on <hi rend="italic">chalk</hi>) is wonderfully dry and trim,&#x2014;the country people in many places trimming their bits of garden, and getting the cabbages in:&#x2014;I cannot tell you how much good it does me to trot along in silence thro&#x2019; these solitary woods and lanes, and see the blessed face of Spring and the natural fields again! I often think, surely I will get into the country altogether again, to live far away from smoke and vain tumults, once more! But that must be as it is ordered;&#x2014;we for our part have to stay where our <hi rend="italic">work</hi> is, if we can find out that.</p>
<p>Once about ten years ago I rode thro&#x2019; this country before;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1840-08">Aug. 1840</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400810-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:222&#x2013;23</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-08-10">10 Aug. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> and find I was just at the gate of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Establishment, on that occasion, not dreaming much that I was to come and live in it, or have a friend living in it, one day! Yesterday I rode too to a Town called Reigate (a smart place about the size of Annan, all screened with high chalk hills); on my former ride thro&#x2019; these parts, I had breakfasted at Reigate; yesterday I saw the old <hi rend="italic">Bull Inn</hi> again, and remembered that morning well. It is very interesting, strange, and excites to pious thoughts and wonder, that looking back upon our past years, and reading the &#x201C;miraculous providences&#x201D; that have presided over them and us! Alas, we are a thoughtless generation; and any one with such <pb id="pg-23-236" n="23:236"/>reflexions in his mind, looks in vain almost for a soul to share them, in these times.</p>
<p>We heard yesterday from Jack; all well with him: there was no other communication left possible with the world, till our return, for we did not leave our new address, but meant all Letters to <hi rend="italic">lie</hi> till we came home to read them. Tomorrow Jane will bring what there is.&#x2014; Helen, on the monday morning, had <hi rend="italic">cut her hand</hi> (while slicing bread; she is a <hi rend="italic">fool</hi>, always &#x201C;unlucky&#x201D;):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, a variation on John Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;always unfortunate&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310418-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:263</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-04-18">18 April 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> this, which quite lames her as a servant, was one of Jane&#x2019;s reasons, I suppose, for persuading me to stay here till Monday. Another reason doubtless is, her pity for poor Sterling. A man really to be pitied. Poor fellow, his Wife in these days is again going <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>,&#x2014;her final recovery, I believe, is quite hopeless; and in her half-and-half state, she keeps him very unhappy. Plenty of money, health of the best, all things that are coveted were, and mostly still are, his; only <hi rend="italic">nothing to do</hi>, either for his Wife or for him: that is the sad fact of it; and that I suppose is the root of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> ills for him,&#x2014;of his Wife&#x2019;s illness, probably among the rest. He seems to have no resource now but <hi rend="italic">keep two houses</hi>, one in Town one here, and by the aid of abundant horses and carriages, roll to and fro between them, up and down every week! A very poor remedy indeed; like a fevered sleepless man, laid in the softest bed, and able only to shift from side to side!&#x2014; He is a good kind fellow too, and with plenty of force and fire in him; often rather reminds me of my poor Brother Alick in many of his ways. Let us hope, things may came a little straighter with him by and by.&#x2014; All these are <hi rend="italic">secrets</hi>, you observe, that I now tell you: but indeed I suppose you have not much temptation to blab them in Annandale just now.</p>
<p>Isabella kindly sent us news; thank her for it very gratefully from me. Many times are you all in my thoughts; no day are you wholly out of them,&#x2014;you dear Mother, who are still left to me, among the chief of my mercies!&#x2014; I must have another Letter before long, tell Isabella. I think of Jamie and his ploughing, and many old days at Mainhill<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The farm nr. Ecclefechan rented by his father, <date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825">25</date>; see vols. 1&#x2013;4.</note> and elsewhere, beside my loved ones, when I look at the furrow-fields spread out here in this <hi rend="italic">new</hi> land, which did not know me at that time. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear old Mother: I have other Letters to write, and had better stop here today. You will get your <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> directed on Monday as usual (we hope), and I shall be 20 miles nearer you than now. Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>My Wife wrote to you from this place the other day; and I neglected to bid her tell you about <hi rend="italic">Whiteside:</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Whiteside, <hi rend="italic">Italy in the Nineteenth Century</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1848">1848</date>), the book not found among those returned from Bath House; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490206-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1849-02-06">6 Feb.</date></ref></note> that is the small purport of my Note this day.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Whiteside</hi> is perfectly safe, lying at Bath House, in a certain room, all this while; and shall be returned to you faithfully in the fulness of time. Him, I imagine, you have already reviewed;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-08-12">12 Aug. 1848</date>. The revised edn. was reviewed, <date when="1849-02-19">19 Feb.</date></note> so that as there is no hurry presupposable in that quarter, I shall take it for granted all is right there.</p>
<p>We were to have been home again today; but that result does not now completely realise itself till Monday:&#x2014;by the bye, if you sent me an <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, I should get it here to my Sunday breakfast, as usual! Instead of that, it lies unopened till Monday afternoon; and the human mind, deprived of its natural food, consumes the same with all the more appetite after so long a fast!&#x2014;(This <hi rend="italic">pen</hi>, with the water ink, with the &#x26;c, is very little to my mind.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I am left here <hi rend="italic">perfectly alone</hi>,&#x2014;such has been the welcome course of events this day;&#x2014;alone, amid the beautiful Chalk Hills, with a quiet Horse to ride, a totally quiet House to lodge in; all silent, bright, mournfully beautiful, as Hades;&#x2014;and my determination is, Not to speak one articulate word to any creature (for the excellent old Scotch-servant will act by dumb-shew) for some four-and-twenty hours to come. An invaluable opportunity for summoning past things, and present, to give account of themselves; and deciding (if one could but decide) numerous Causes <foreign><hi rend="italic">in Banco Regis</hi></foreign> [with regal authority]. I find the Sermon which this old Earth preaches to me, when she has the opportunity, worth all other Sermons. Yesterday I was at Reigate; the day before at Dorking, over Box Hill; the day before that, on Epsom race-course, all to myself and to the <date when="--02">February</date> Sun, a truly <hi rend="italic">impressive</hi> scene to me: this day I have thoughts of <hi rend="italic">Gatton</hi>, that I may see the Brother of Old Sarum, which is present to me since last year.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gatton village and parish, on the N Downs of Surrey, and Old Sarum, extinct city 2 mi.

<p><pb id="pg-23-238" n="23:238"/>I did not hope <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much of Macaulay&#x2019;s History; and even under these terms I was disappointed.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The Third Edition of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> goes into the Printer&#x2019;s hands tomorrow.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frewen had written to TC, <date when="1849-01-16">16 Jan.</date>, to pass on an anecdote about Cromwell&#x2019;s piety he hoped could be included in the third edn. Also he found &#x201C;a few trivial &#x26; unimportant errors in your notes, which I shall not trouble you with pointing out, unless you wish it.&#x201D; He admired <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> so much he had given away seven copies: &#x201C;I know no book which contains so much sound divinity &#x26; deep practical wisdom as pervades them. I feel it a duty &#x26; a gratification to circulate such a work.&#x201D; Charles Robson of Levey, Robson &#x26; Franklyn had done most of TC&#x2019;s printing since <date when="1837">1837</date>.</note> I suppose he will not yet, for perhaps ten days or more, come upon any passage liable to be affected by your Annotations; and probably it may be a month before he is fairly thro&#x2019; the First Volume. There is not therefore any quite immediate pressure of hurry upon you; only the sooner you can please to favour me with these Marginal Remarks you were so good as promise, it will be the better.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frewen replied, <date when="1849-02-23">23 Feb.</date>, with four pages of comments.</note> More especially, as there is at best little time to deliberate upon them.</p>
<p>Wharton&#x2019;s newborn Son, I now discover (or rather, a Gentleman at the Museum has, with labour, discovered for me), <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the Duke of Wharton&#x2019;s Father; &#x2018;died in <date when="1715">1715</date> in the 67<hi rend="italic">th</hi> year of his age,&#x2019; after a busy and somewhat distinguished life.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490202-TC-TW-01">TC to TW, <date when="1849-02-02">2 Feb.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>There does not seem the slightest sound basis for any of the pretended <hi rend="italic">Heads</hi> of Oliver. The one at present in vogue was visited, the other day, by a friend of mine: it has hair, flesh, beard,&#x2014;a written history bearing <pb id="pg-23-239" n="23:239"/>evidence that it was purchased for &#xa3;100 (I think, and of <hi rend="italic">bad debt</hi>) about 50 years ago;&#x2014;it also appears to have once had resinous unguents, or embalming substances in it, and to have stood upon a spike:&#x2014;likely enough, the head of <hi rend="italic">some</hi> decapitated man of distinction: but by the size of the face, by the very width of the jawbone, were there no other proof, it has not any chance to be Oliver&#x2019;s head. A professional Sculptor, about a year ago, gave me the same report of it: &#x201C;a very much <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> face than Oliver&#x2019;s; quite another face.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the fate of Cromwell&#x2019;s head after disinterment at Westminster, see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420929-TC-EF-01"><sic>15:111</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-29">29 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421103-TC-ES-01"><sic>161-62</sic><corr>TC to ES, <date when="1842-11-03">3 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> The story told, of a high wind, a sentinel &#x26;c, is identical with what your old neighbour heard, long since, of the Oliver Head in the shape of <hi rend="italic">a Scull.</hi> In short, this whole affair appears to be fraudulent moonshine,&#x2014;an element not pleasant even to glance into; especially in a case like Oliver&#x2019;s.</p>

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I snatch two minutes from confusion worse confounded to send old Mary&#x2019;s money,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sent at least twice annually to this former servant of JWC&#x2019;s mother at Templand, nr. Thornhill.</note> which I fear is already past time&#x2014; It has been in my mind for the last three weeks; but I could not come at the needful in the country place where we had gone for a short visit, and since our return to London I have been &#x201C;troubled about many things&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 10:41.</note>&#x2014;with a vengeance!</p>
<p>On Monday last we drew up at our own door, in Capt Sterlings carriage (the gentleman with whom we had been staying) meaning to drive on to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> town house to settle some concern of a Governess for him, when I should have deposited my Husband and luggage at home&#x2014; We rapped and rung&#x2014;a long time without being opened to at last the door opened and an apparition presented itself which I shall certainly never forget as long as I live!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">There</hi> stood Helen&#x2014;her mouth covered with blood, her brow, <pb id="pg-23-240" n="23:240"/>cheek and dark dress whitened with the chalk of the kitchen floor, like a very ill got up stage-ghost, her hair streaming wildly from under a crushed cap&#x2014;and her face wearing a smile of idiotic self-complacency! My first thought was that thieves had been <hi rend="italic">murdering</hi> her (at least one in the forenoon!) but the truth came fast enough: &#x201C;she is mortal drunk&#x201D;! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had to <hi rend="italic">drag</hi> her down into the kitchen&#x2014;for she was very insubordinate and refused to budge from the door&#x2014;Capt S<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x26; his coachman looking on! Of course I remained in my own house for the rest of the day&#x2014; A woman who lives close by came to help me&#x2014;and take care of the drunk creature who so soon as she got her legs again&#x2014;rushed out for more drink! She had had <hi rend="italic">half a pint</hi> of gin in the morning in the afternoon <hi rend="italic">half a pint</hi> of rum and some ale!! that is what one would call good drinking! between nine and ten she returned&#x2014;and lay <hi rend="italic">locked up</hi> all night insensible then we had a fit of <foreign>delirium tremens</foreign>, then twenty four hours of weeping and wailing and trying to take me by compassion as she had done so often before&#x2014;but it would not do&#x2014;I have never liked her ways since she returned to me&#x2014;the fact has been, tho I did not know it, that she was always partially drunk&#x2014; So I felt thankful for this <hi rend="italic">decided</hi> outbreak to put an end to my cowardly offputting in seeking myself a new servant&#x2014; The very day this horror happened, a very promising Servant was sent to me quite providentially to <hi rend="italic">look at</hi>, by a Lady<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie B&#xF6;lte.</note> who has been a good while urging me to be done with Helen, and who thought it a pity I should not have the refusal of this one&#x2014; So I &#x201C;went after her character&#x201D; and engaged her the following day, but could not have her home till the wretched being was removed and the horribly dirty house cleaned up&#x2014;in which process I am now over head and ears&#x2014; I wished Helen to go back to her Sister in Kircaldy<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Black.</note> and offered to pay her expenses but she <hi rend="italic">wont</hi>&#x2014; She was <hi rend="italic">determined to stay here!</hi>&#x2014;but I put her into a carriage yesterday, whether she would or no and carried her off to a woman she has been long intimate with and established her in a room of her house&#x2014;for a fortnight&#x2014;to look after a place&#x2014;but who will take her without a character for <hi rend="italic">sobriety</hi>? and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> certainly will not be criminal enough to conceal her drinking propensity <hi rend="italic">if I am asked.</hi> God knows what is to come of her!&#x2014; I told her yesterday she would be better <hi rend="italic">dead!</hi>&#x2014;if she were not so old and ugly of course she would go on the streets&#x2014;for all morality is broken down in her&#x2014; I find now that she has not been even <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> since she returned from Dublin&#x2014;a pretty mess that Brother of her&#x2019;sJohn Mitchell; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460925-TC-JAC-01"><sic>21:57</sic><corr>Tc to JAC, <date when="1846-09-25">25 Sept. 1846</date></corr></ref>. has made of his own flesh and blood&#x2014;but I must not scribble any more here&#x2014;having a hundred and fifty things to do.</p>

<salute>My dear Mrs Buller,</salute>
<p>I am very sorry you have been troubled on this matter of the Liskeard Sculptor;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Charles Buller.</note> you, who have so much else to trouble you, and by me, who ought not to be employed in that work of all others!</p>
<p>Here is the poor man&#x2019;s Letter, which came to me while Jane was with you yesterday; which pray read, and then <hi rend="italic">burn</hi>, without answer to me, or to any one, concerning it. And so let the whole matter rest, and be as if it had not been. I have written today to the poor man that there is no kind of hope for him; that he had better renounce the attempt of modelling such a Bust at present,&#x2014;which I fancy he will, when he reflects on it, incline to do, having no chance whatever to succeed in such an enterprise.</p>
<p>And now, if you will forgive me the little fret I unwittingly inflicted on you yesterday thro&#x2019; Jane,&#x2014;an act of grace which I think you have already <hi rend="italic">done</hi>,&#x2014;this small futile affair has ended; and we will look forward to better that are coming, or are hoped to be coming!</p>
<p>Burn the Sculptorial Letter; and make no answer to me, till I get to see you in your new House.</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>I have so much to tell and so little time to tell it in that I don&#x2019;t know where to begin&#x2014;besides I have forgotten in the, &#x201C;hubbub wild and dire dismay<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 2:951.</note> of late days where I left off in <hi rend="italic">my life</hi>&#x2014;that is to say the history of <pb id="pg-23-243" n="23:243"/>my life&#x2014;outwardly speaking&#x2014;but certainly when I wrote last I was not gone nor meaning to go to Hedly&#x2014;so I shall begin with that&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C surprisingly invited himself to Hedly (Capt S&#x2019;s country place) incited thereto by the charming description given of it by John Carlyle, who had gone down with Capt S for a couple of days&#x2014;a beautiful country mansion, with &#x201C;fresh air,&#x201D; and horses to ride, and no <hi rend="italic">woman</hi> in the house, or servant of any sort indoors, but one old Scotch Cook&#x2014;taking care of the premises in the absence of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Sterling and the children now settled at Knightsbridge&#x2014;all <hi rend="italic">that</hi> had charms for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014; And there being nobody in town just then that he cared to stay for&#x2014;he proposed to go down with Anthony on his next weekly visit to the place&#x2014;but Anthony had no notion of having <hi rend="italic">him</hi> without <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C himself thought I should go, to &#x201C;keep Anthony off him and let him enjoy <hi rend="italic">the perfect</hi> silence&#x201C;&#x2014; (As if <hi rend="italic">that</hi> man <hi rend="italic">could</hi> enjoy or yet <hi rend="italic">endure</hi> perfect silence for one week!)&#x2014; I liked the idea of going; but would not agree till I had written to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Sterling about it, and asked <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to go too! It was all very well to tell me she was fast going mad again, and that it was determined she should <hi rend="italic">never</hi> go back to Hedley, All that was no concern of mine no reason that I should cause her annoyance&#x2014; So I wrote and she answered me in the friendliest manner&#x2014;without mentioning the thing to her Husband&#x2014;declining to go to Hedly &#x201C;from the shades of which she was too happy to have just escaped&#x201D; but &#x201C;seeing no earthly reason why I should not go with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and Capt S<hi rend="italic">g</hi> I was so glad after, that I had, as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C phrased it, &#x201C;completely attended to <hi rend="italic">the three thousand punctualities</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; from the Chinese novel <hi rend="italic">Two Fair Cousins.</hi></note> with her,&#x201D; for if I had not; I could not have felt sure the irritation of our settling such a thing without her knowledge had not hastened the final explosion of the fit of mania hanging over her the last six weeks&#x2014; It exploded <hi rend="italic">before</hi> our visit took place&#x2014;for a <hi rend="italic">fortnight</hi> she was in a strait-waistcoat occasionally; but is now more quiet tho&#x2019; still confined to a room with two mad-nurses. She has shewn no dislike of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> this time&#x2014;on the contrary seems to want to make <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a party against her Husband&#x2014;poor thing. But all this of <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, is nothing new now&#x2014; Her Husband takes it, as a matter of course&#x2014;and tries to keep &#x201C;never minding&#x201C;&#x2014; We went to Hedly on Tuesday gone a week, meaning to return on Friday&#x2014;but the curious Gipsy life we led, on a <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> of all the comforts and luxuries of civilization&#x2014;answered so well that on Friday I came to town with Anthony (who had to go and speak with Mad-doctors) leaving M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. in perfect bliss&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">solitude</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">be</hi> <hi rend="italic">bliss</hi>&#x2014;and having provided changes of linen &#x26;c returned next morning to remain till Monday&#x2014; It was the most successful visit I have made for long&#x2014;Anthony and I laid the table set wax candles &#x26;c &#x26;c the old woman cooked out of sight what victuals were not brought ready from London&#x2014; <pb id="pg-23-244" n="23:244"/>and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C let himself be <hi rend="italic">waited upon</hi> by us with an amiability. Then He had four riding horses which he might by turns gallop to death&#x2014;and I had a pony which took me as fast as Anthony could <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> at his head, over all the beautiful hills in the neighbourhood&#x2014;and we sat and smoked in <hi rend="italic">the carpenters shop</hi> Capt S has fitted up for himself&#x2014;and I learned to <hi rend="italic">turn</hi> and shoot with a bow&#x2014;and shot&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">myself</hi> in the cheek!&#x2014;as a green mark can testify to this hour: and indeed indeed&#x2014;I felt very like little Macready on its late three days visit to myself<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lydia Jane Macready; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490120-JWC-HW-01">JWC to <sic>JW</sic><corr>HW</corr></ref>, [<date when="1849-01-20">20 Jan.</date>].</note>&#x2014;with no end of wishes and whim and a childish surprise and felicity to find them all immediately gratified.</p>
<p>Monday came however&#x2014;and we <hi rend="italic">must</hi> return&#x2014;the Ashburtons were to come to town that day, and we were to dine at Bath House Tuesday&#x2014; We drove to our own door where M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and the luggage were to be deposited, I going on to Knightsbridge with Anthony to settle about a Governess for him&#x2014; But M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C knocked in vain for a good while and we were speculation about breaking in at a window, and storming at Helen for having gone out when she knew we were coming. when the door opened to a twentieth blow and an apparition presented itself which I shall remember as long as I live.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I will write you a little word today, tho&#x2019; the time is not very favourable. A <pb id="pg-23-248" n="23:248"/>little word is better than none. What is becoming of you, yourself, in these hard days of frost, sleet and northwind? I would give somewhat to know just now! Really it is very cold; and this, remember, dear Mother, is the worst of all the seasons for health: therefore stand by your flannels, take care of yourself.</p>
<p>The last place I wrote to you from was Headly, Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s, that day I was left alone there. Jane and &#x201C;the Captain&#x201D; returned duly next day; and on the whole, what with fine weather, good horses, plenty of tobacco, and entire freedom, the visit was altogether tolerably successful. I had some beautiful rides, in the sunny spring weather,&#x2014;rode to fine smart Towns, all as neat as a new pin; remembered, with interest, when I had seen them last: once, upon a ride ten years ago into Sussex, I had been (it turned out) close upon Sterling&#x2019;s place; but could not, for a good while, on this occasion, discover so much,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">roads</hi> are infinitely intricate, so <hi rend="italic">many</hi> of them, and winding and branching in labyrinths of lanes: however, they are very pretty; and the open &#x201C;heaths,&#x201D; and Chalk Hills (which bear the beautifullest grass for sheep) are a delightful kind of country to ride in. But terribly uncultivated! I think <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the South of England, capable of being ploughed, is not under the plough at all. And <hi rend="italic">Torbeck Hill</hi> moor, with an obstinate John Bell to operate on it,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Torbeckhill is approx. 5 mi. NE of Ecclefechan. John Bell was a local farmer; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371223-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:377</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-12-23">23 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> is quite as good for <hi rend="italic">sheep!</hi>&#x2014; This must alter, some day.</p>
<p>On our getting home on Monday after (the Monday gone a week now), when Sterling drove us up to the door, a very unexpected scene presented itself. First, for several minutes, no answer to the bell whatever; then,&#x2014;Helen with a streak of blood on her face, floor-whitening on her gown, rocking to and fro, and in brief <hi rend="italic">as drunk as Chloe!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A joke; cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> 3.15, and 19:218.</note> She had long been giving no sort of satisfaction; indeed, from the first, Jane noticed that she was quite an altered creature, estranged, careless, incessantly stupid; we now perceive she must have fallen into drinking, probably too into plundering and stealing, with that Dublin Brother of hers,&#x2014;who accordingly had cast her off, to incurable ruin (as is too plain). Jane had decided firmly before to send her away; but this new phenomenon, of course, rendered <hi rend="italic">instant despatch</hi> unavoidable. You may fancy what a busy week poor Jane had: in about 5 minutes she had raised some respectable woman in the neighbourhood to take charge in the interim, ordered Helen to vanish into the lower premises altogether; and so could wait, and look about her a little. Helen, kept close below hatches all the time, was on the second day whirled off to one of her many female friends in Town (some five miles of <pb id="pg-23-249" n="23:249"/>this, a respectable rigid woman, who had a room to let, and engaged to help her what she could); in the meanwhile, by great good luck, notice of a new altogether eligible servant had arrived; whom Jane, of course engaged; who is now <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, and promises to do excellently: a nice quiet lass from Devonshire, well recommended by people that have known her, altogether highly promising hitherto:&#x2014;and so the House is in order again; and the wretched little &#x201C;drunken dottle&#x201D; must either go home to Fife again or do what else she likes, but not look <hi rend="italic">this</hi> house in the face any more. Poor degraded wretch; nobody, except by the accursed aid of gin, <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have sunk to such depths as she lately! Jane found the house in a shocking condition in all corners of it; imagines the unhappy creature has been <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi> almost every night; and generally half-drunk at all times, since she last arrived here. She <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> her history among us (we cannot but believe) by picking a sovereign out of Jane&#x2019;s purse the hour before she went away;&#x2014;may it be usefuller to her than seems likely;&#x2014;and, on the whole, let us <hi rend="italic">end</hi> all talk about her, all concern with her or her miserable business, forever and a day!&#x2014;Last night Jane was terribly alarmed by missing &#x201C;about &#xa3;70 worth of silver things,&#x201C;&#x2014;stolen, apparently by Helen and her gang! We had reconciled ourselves to the loss,&#x2014;when, lo, they all turned up again, safe stowed in another place. No theft yet, but that of the sovereign, and some quarters of tobacco of mine, has been discovered to lie clearly, or with clear probability, at her door.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Alas, here is a man come for me: I must off, dear Mother!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I pray you renounce altogether that <hi rend="italic">Rushworth</hi> hunt; I am quite past the place, have satisfactorily settled it otherwise; and except for <hi rend="italic">bibliographical</hi> purposes (which are none of <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>), the question is not of the smallest moment.</p>
<p>But if you will do me a favour,&#x2014;here is a deliverance and service which you may accomplish much more easily. Among your Pamphlets (King&#x2019;s P<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, I suppose, tho&#x2019; that stands not on the record) is &#x201C;A Letter from the Lord Lieut<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (of Ireland) to the Hon. W. Lenthall&#x2014;together with the several transactions about the <hi rend="italic">surrender of Kilkenny</hi>&#x2014;London (Husbands and Field) <date when="1650">1650</date>&#x201C;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the letter, <date when="1650-04-02">2 April 1650</date>, to William Lenthall (<date when="1591">1591</date>&#x2013;<date when="1662">1662</date>), speaker of the House of Commons, on the siege of Kilkenny, see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 7:153&#x2013;59. TC had inquired widely for other Cromwell letters. Apparently he had requested the Dowager Lady Sandwich to ask her son to look into the Montagu archives for Cromwellian material; for Lord Sandwich wrote to her, <date when="1849-02-18">18 Feb.</date>, copying out a letter from Cromwell to Gen. Montagu of <date when="1657-10-02">2 Oct. 1657</date>, &#x201C;the only letter with Oliver&#x2019;s signature I have been able to discover amongst my papers. &#x2026; I have no objection to your sending this to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, but I think we should keep all other papers intact, as when they are published they should be original&#x201D; (MS: Yale). TC printed the letter, noting: &#x201C;Original in the possession of the Earl of Sandwich, at Hinchinbrook (<date when="1849-02">February 1849</date>)&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:135n).</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; Order this to be sought out for me, and have it lying tomorrow (Saturday) about Noon with the <hi rend="italic">man at the post-hole</hi>, who gives and receives Books (I know not his name); &#x201C;The Pamphlet Mr Watts sent for Mr Carlyle,&#x201D; will suffice to name it to <hi rend="italic">him:</hi> I want the thing for an hour or so; and would fain spare myself the torment of fishing it out of your millponds.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I like your Lecture on <hi rend="italic">Buxton</hi>, as I run over it, very well; and am much obliged by that mark of your attention.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-23-251" n="23:251"/>If you will take the trouble to come so far, on Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> about 7 o&#x2019;clock, you will find my Wife and me, with the Teakettle near boiling; no other company that I know of;&#x2014;and very happy to have a little discourse with you on the occasion.</p>
<p>Gilfillan is a little awkward: I wish somebody, more familiar with him than I, would put him in mind that such procedure is quite unwarrantable, and contrary to the tacit engagement every man enters into with another in beginning to converse at all. Not one, or hardly one, of the few times I have ever met him but he forthwith emits some rubbishy account of the affair&#x2014;very regardless of several quite evident considerations.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Gilfillan met TC in <date when="1843">1843</date> (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430812-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:40</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-12">12 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>) and then pbd. a sketch of him in <hi rend="italic">A Gallery of Literary Portraits</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1845">1845</date>) 124&#x2013;25. The last two pages were based on this meeting. He may also have quoted TC&#x2019;s opinion, without attribution, in &#x201C;Ralph Emerson; or the &#x2018;Coming Man,&#x2019;&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> n.s. <date when="1848-01-15">15 (Jan. 1848)</date>:17&#x2013;25. He had briefly reviewed some of Binney&#x2019;s pamphlets in &#x201C;A Bundle of Books,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s</hi> n.s. <date when="1848-11-15">15 (Nov. 1848)</date>:729. Binney had perhaps complained about his comments: &#x201C;[T]he manly pen of the manly and high-minded Thomas Binney &#x2026; his views are liberal and far advanced, and therefore &#x2026; his party justly treats him as a privileged man, allows him to do and say what he pleases, right well assured that his most eccentric sayings and doings will, in the long run, round themselves in within a just and proper centre of conduct and thought.&#x201D;</note> The man has otherwise an undeniable worth; but this practice decidedly is not tolerable,&#x2014;and will have results for him, if he do not abandon it.</p>

<p>&#x2014;Thanks for the offer of music but I found the only concern of that sort I ever tried dreadfully wearisome and besides a concert room in this weather! Oh my dear! &#x201C;dinna speak o&#x2019; it!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Yesterday on my way to Oxford Street in quest of <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> stockings I called on your milliner&#x2014;but saw nothing to excite my cupidity&#x2014;besides, the things seemed to me much about the usual shop-price!&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Thanks for all your &#x201C;delicate attentions&#x201C;&#x2014;I rather wish you <hi rend="small-caps">had</hi> been &#x201C;a man&#x201D;; for if anything could rouse a spirit in one it would surely be the getting oneself &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">eloped with</hi>&#x201D; and I think <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> me better than any <hi rend="italic">male lover</hi> ever did&#x2014;hang them all!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >B&#xF6;lte wrote Varnhagen, <date when="1849-03-19">19 March</date>, that she had made a &#x201C;fresh attack&#x201D; on TC, saying that &#x201C;neither I nor his wife&#x201D; had sat for portraits to send Varnhagen, &#x201C;only Miss Wynn and Lady Ashburton could do that, for he favored them both, and only them.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Before going out today I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> write you a little word; a thing I have resolved to do for several days back, but always been prevented by some foolish Cause or other. How are you, dear Mother? We had Isabella&#x2019;s Letter, which was very welcome: but the weather has been very cold since, and still is. Many people here have <hi rend="italic">sore throat</hi>, and other ailments produced by the hard north wind. You are wonderfully well, in general; which surely is a great mercy to all of us. Here, in our little circle, things in respect of health go on very tolerably: we complain of the weather too, but only as &#x201C;disagreeable,&#x201D; and are all going on foot as usual, strangers to the maladies that are said to be prevalent. Jane is very busy, making a &#x201C;folding screen&#x201D; out of heaps of old Prints and Pictures: it is a work of art,&#x2014;a work, I well perceive, of time! It agreeably occupies the artistic female mind within doors, when there is bad weather without!</p>
<p>Our new Maid-servant does excellently hitherto: a nice, orderly, contented creature; likely, we think, to go on doing well. Helen too, we understand, has actually got another place; so that we take leave of her, not quite in the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> stage, tho&#x2019; probably the last cannot now be very doubtful for her. Jane steadily refused to tell a lie on her account; told the Dame who came here for a character to Helen, all the good of her she could, how <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> she was &#x26;c &#x26;c;&#x2014;and, at last when the Dame inquired, &#x201C;Sober, of course?&#x201D; communicated the real story of her drinking; which, tho&#x2019; it staggered the Dame a good deal, did not quite overset her, so charmed was she with the &#x201C;willingness&#x201D; &#x26;c. So that matter too is well settled; and as Jane decides not to correspond with, or see, Helen any more, we will let <hi rend="italic">well</hi> continue well.</p>
<p>I have been busy, these several weeks, patching together my <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> scraps; trimming all up for a new edition. I have <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> it this very morning (at least I hope so), and can now expect that the Printer will take it mainly on his own shoulders, so that I shall not be troubled with it much, but let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> produce it in a complete shape. It is to be in Four volumes, a handier shape than you have yet had it in;&#x2014;so that you may look out for somebody whom you can give your second edition to, if you like, and be ready for this new one in due time.</p>
<p>I do not think we ever properly thanked anybody for that eminent bit of Beef Ham. It was cut into two pieces, boiled successively. The first <pb id="pg-23-254" n="23:254"/>piece,&#x2014;something coming in the way, from Fife or Liverpool I think,&#x2014;was put by untasted: when asked for, about a month after when the Fife ware was consumed, drunken Helen <hi rend="italic">had eaten it all;</hi>&#x2014;a feat for which she got very small thanks I apprehend! The second Piece, however, reached its <hi rend="italic">due</hi> destination; and, for many mornings, was sparingly partaken of, and much admired indeed. We are now upon the Ham proper, Jamie&#x2019;s Bacon Ham: and &#x201C;it is but fair to state,&#x201D; as Jeffrey says,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Francis Jeffrey&#x2019;s quotation, see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370321-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:175</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-03-21">21 March 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> a better Ham was seldom eaten anywhere. Really excellent, and in perfect <hi rend="italic">soundness</hi> too every thread of it; which latter is an <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> quality, that has been more or less wanting in many specimens of late,&#x2014;in the late Fife one, among others. Thanks to the kind Givers! The potatoes too, tho&#x2019; not <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that one could wish, continue eatable and very useful: the Butter lastly it appears is <hi rend="italic">improving</hi>, as it draws towards the bottom of the kit! &#x201C;<foreign>Wae&#x2019;s tem wi&#x2019; their bags!</foreign>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471225-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1847-12-25">25 Dec. 1847</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>This morning I had a visit from a most fiery Irish Protestant Priest, a &#x201C;Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Mr Gregg&#x201D; of Dublin,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. Tresham Dames Gregg (<date when="1800">1800</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1881">1881</date>), B.A., Dublin Univ., <date when="1826">1826</date>; M.A., <date when="1830">1830</date>; B.D. and D.D., <date when="1853">1853</date>; chaplain of St. Nicholas Within, Dublin, member of the Dublin Protestant Assoc.; author of many religious works, including <hi rend="italic">Free Thoughts on Protestant Matters</hi> (Dublin, <date when="1846">1846</date>). In the pref. to the second edn., <date when="1847">1847</date>, he enlarged on hostility &#x201C;to the infatuated workings of the late unprincipled Prime Minister&#x201D; (xii), referred to later as &#x201C;Sir Rotten Peel&#x201D; (67), and the Maynooth reforms (see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450407-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>19:52&#x2013;53</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1845-04-07">7 April 1845</date></corr></ref>). He presumably approached TC because of the latter&#x2019;s known interest in Ireland. In early <date when="1848-11">Nov. 1848</date>, TC worked on an article on Peel&#x2019;s scheme for Ireland, which began: &#x201C;To the world the chief merit of Sir R<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Peel&#x2019;s scheme for Ireland is an entirely indisputable one; and lies not in its worth as a scheme, but in the grand fact that it is a scheme at all. Food by charitable Indian meal, and shot by military police, that portentous apotheosis of the futilities is to cease. England with what practical faculty, of real human insight and energy it has or can get, is at last to try the Irish problem.&#x201D; TC wrote about fifty MS pages but was unable to finish it, writing at the end: &#x201C;Sunday. <date when="1848-11-05">Nov. 5</date>&#x2014;alas!&#x2014;&#x201D; (MS: Yale).</note>&#x2014;who, if he could but interest &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Thomas Carloile</hi>&#x201D; in his ideas, would quickly get them disseminated over all the world:&#x2014;but this, I doubt, will be very difficult to do!</p>
<p>Poor Mrs Buller has got delivered from her thousand woes, poor woman.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She died, <date when="1849-03-14">14 March</date>.</note> She died, last week; hardly anybody, except my Jane in the least expecting such a change. Very sad; yet the only result to be desired: in my life I have seen no more entirely wrecked creature,&#x2014; Dear Mother, you must get Isabella or some of them to write soon; a little word is much better than none. Tell us what you are reading: we can get you other Books easily here; indeed I perhaps have already some suitable. <closer><salute>Blessings with you, dear good Mother, you and all.

Knowing as we do so many official people, and people of high rank and large fortune it were only to be believed, by having lived and <hi rend="italic">tried</hi>, in that sort of society, oneself, how difficult, actually impossible it is, to get any post for ones dearest friend; unless oneself or the friend have claims on some political party, or can in some way forward such party&#x2019;s interests. When Mr. C was writing his Cromwell he needed someone to copy at the British Museum, <pb id="pg-23-256" n="23:256"/>and a young Scotchman with a doctor&#x2019;s diploma and no practice,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Christie.</note> starving here with a young wife and one child, thankfully undertook the work&#x2014;for many months all they had had to live on was, what the <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi> wife earned by sitting and standing to Artists as a model at a shilling an hour!! He satisfied Mr. C entirely during the two years he worked for him&#x2014;not little to do!&#x2014;and both he and I took a quite painful interest in him and his wife, and talked about him and wrote about him and recommended him, and entreated for him&#x2014;to right and left&#x2014; After he had done Mr. C&#x2019;s work we got him some little jobs but nothing of a permanent sort by all our exertions&#x2014;till the young wife broke down in it&#x2014;died of consumption&#x2014;and the man seemed to be following her. Then we made new and desperate efforts.&#x2014; I actually <hi rend="italic">cried</hi> about him to Lady Ashburton and Charles Buller&#x2014;but the answer then as ever was &#x2018;you know ones whole influence <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be given to one&#x2019;s constituents.&#x2019; At last a place&#x2014;of nearly eighty pounds a year in the Record Office fell to him thro&#x2019; happy accident and partly thro&#x2019; Mr. C&#x2019;s letters of recommendation&#x2014;but too late&#x2014;his long struggle had worn him out&#x2014;he only filled his clerkship two months then returned to Aberdeen to die bequeathing his child to me! But it&#x2019;s grandmother is a better guardian for it.&#x2014; I tell you this tragedy not to discourage you Dear, few people are so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> unfortunate as poor Christy was&#x2014;but to shew little <hi rend="italic">influence of a practical sort</hi> one gets thro all ones <hi rend="italic">celebrity</hi>&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Dinners</hi> one may have at the rate of a dozen a day if one could eat them, and soir&#xE9;es and applications for autographs by every post, and declarations of deathless enthusiasm from young Ladies, &#x26;c. &#x26;c.&#x2014;but never the paltriest office to give away!&#x2014; However accident sometimes <hi rend="italic">offers</hi> what no efforts can <hi rend="italic">obtain</hi> and you may depend upon it no opportunity of aiding John will be allowed to slip by us.&#x2014; Meanwhile Mr. C. had employed a friend<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erasmus Darwin, who replied by letter, <date when="1849-03-30">30 March</date> (<hi rend="italic">LJWC</hi> 626).</note> to consult Lyell the Geologist on the subject the only <hi rend="italic">scientific</hi> man we know much about&#x2014;whatever comes of the enquiry I will communicate to you.

What hindered me from writing, what was felt and spoken, my hearty thanks to you for such a kindness, I do not know; perhaps some obscure feeling that your promises were all the same as facts,&#x2014;that you would understand by intuition the Book <hi rend="italic">had</hi> come!&#x2014; I have read Calamy&#x2019;s life of Howe with the pleasure I always get from Calamy; and everywhere, as I dip into the big volume, there rise pleasant intimations, in obsolete dialect, that here also in his time was a man that knew light from dark as a man ought to know. Indeed his Face is itself the best Letter of introduction: I know not when I have seen a human countenance more expressive of valour and benignity, in the intellectual sphere. Many thanks to you. I find hitherto no corner in <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> that will well hold John Howe; but he will not be lost on me altogether, notwithstanding that.</p>

<p>Thank you for again remembering us: your kindness in this direction is of old standing now, and you may believe is never quite forgotten here.</p>
<p>The Female branch of this establishment laments to find the weather so inclement, and does not think of venturing. As for me, I also have misgivings as to Thursday; but will soon make the voyage out<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To the Taylors&#x2019; home in Mortlake.</note> on some more independent principle.

But the sight of friendly H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Taylor people: Yes, that is something; and that I will accomplish some day before long for my own behoof, if all go well. Some Sunday most likely:&#x2014;who knows if not next Sunday.</p>
<p>For many weeks I have quite lost trace of Aubrey de Vere.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your interesting little Book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the pamphlet <hi rend="italic">&#xc0; l&#x2019;opinion publique, le citoyen Louis Blanc. Journ&#xE9;e du 15 mai</hi> (Paris, 1848).</note> which I was sorry not to be at home to receive. I have read the Pamphlet carefully from beginning to end; and can readily accept this Narrative as the actual history, in every particular, of your movements in those unlucky days. A conclusion in <pb id="pg-23-261" n="23:261"/>which, I think, all persons of candour will agree with me; for there is a tone of perfect good faith, of probity, veracity, and pure simplicity of heart, which powerfully appeals to such. This I can believe you to have gained by writing at present; and this, if nothing else were gained, is a thing to be prized.</p>
<p>I will say further, that, in reading all your Books, I have found myself agree completely in your denunciation, or were it even execration and excommunication, of the actual figure of Society; which cannot seem beautiful or true to any noble-minded man, but must find in every such man a loud or silent enemy, and adversary to the death. I agree too that in what you call &#x201C;association,&#x201C;&#x2014;which I should prefer to call just <hi rend="italic">government</hi>, without which human beings never lived, nor I believe can live,&#x2014;there will be immense advantages, improvements literally without limit.</p>
<p>But alas, to judge by the abyss of corruptions in which the universal populations of the world are steeped, and sunk beyond consciousness or reminiscence or anticipation, at present,&#x2014;one might fear, such a result must lie long centuries away from us; and little in the meanwhile but new insurrections followed by new charlatanisms be possible for us! However, it is always beneficial that anarchies do, by street barricades or otherwise, <hi rend="italic">declare</hi> themselves anarchic;&#x2014;and on the whole, there is no <hi rend="italic">good</hi> in any of us but will one day be added, very exactly, to the general sum. Courage, therefore!</p>
<p>I doubt you will never read so much English in the manuscript state; and unluckily I have quite lost the habit of writing or speaking even bad French, for these last seven years or more. Come down again, however, and I will try again. There are some men one can speak a little with, almost without language.&#x2014; We are here on Sunday evening, for example, and probably nobody with us.</p>

<salute>Dear Lockhart,</salute>
<p>Here are your Session Papers again, with many thanks to the Lord Peter and you. I had heard of Jeffrey&#x2019;s opinion on the same question, but do not <pb id="pg-23-262" n="23:262"/>find it here; perhaps he sits in some other &#x201C;Division,&#x201D; under some other kind of wig:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Papers of the Scottish court of session.

<p>If you could be so kind as give me a Copy of that Cromwell Letter from <hi rend="italic">Polwhele</hi>, I would still try to squeeze it into the Appendix of the Third Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I have now finished that affair, and sent it off to the Printer some time ago, intending not to concern myself with it farther.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edleston wrote, <date when="1849-03-28">28 March</date>: &#x201C;A month or two ago I met with a letter of Cromwell&#x2019;s in &#x2018;Polwhele&#x2019;s Traditions &#x26; Recollections&#x2019; London <date when="1826">1826</date> p. 22. &#x2026; The letter is addressed to Col.
