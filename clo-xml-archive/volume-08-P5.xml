<p>The editors wish to repeat their thanks to all those listed in the Acknowledgments in the opening pages of volumes 1 and 5 and also to thank James R. G. Wright, formerly of Edinburgh University, now of St. Catharine&#x2019;s College, Cambridge; L. Ardern, Librarian, Hornel Collection, Broughton House, Kirkcudbright; Col. James Edgar, Curator, Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea; E. J. Balley; and Joe Rees and Jane Vogel, Duke University Library. They regret that volumes 8 and 9 carry on their title pages for the last time the name of Professor John Clubbe, whose work on the edition ended when he left Duke to go to the University of Kentucky in the autumn of <date when="1976-00-00">1976</date>, but who had worked with translations and draft notes for some later letters, particularly those for <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date> and early <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>, before he left.<pb id="lastpage-08-viii" n="08:viii"/></p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This pitifullest piece of thin paper is all the weight allowable; and I cannot send you <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Copy of the Word on Irving&#x2019;s death:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had died on <date when="1834-12-07">7 Dec.</date>, and Carlyle had briefly written about him for <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XI (<date when="1835-01-00">Jan. 1835</date>), 101&#x2013;3. See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341219-TC-DH-01"><sic>7:344</sic><corr>TC to DH, <date when="1834-12-19">19 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>.<lb/><lb/>
Carlyle had begun the year sadly, and recorded in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;Twelve o&#x2019;clock has just struck: the last hour of <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, the first of a new year. Bells ringing (to me dolefully); a wet wind blustering; my wife in bed (very unhappily ill of a foot which a puddle of a maid scalded three weeks ago): I, after a day of fruitless toil, reading and re-reading about that Versailles &#x2018;<date when="1789-10-06">6th of October</date>&#x2019; still. It is long since I have written anything here. The future looks too black round me, the present too doleful, unfriendly; I am too sick at heart (wearied, wasted in body) to complain&#x2014;even to myself. My first friend Edward Irving is dead; above three weeks ago, I am friendless here; or as good as that. My Book <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> get on, though I stick to it like a bur.&#x201D;</note> but it lies here for you, and shall be sent. You have poor Mrs Irving&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Formerly Mary Lowther (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), daughter of a small landowner in Dornock parish. Mrs. Irving lived in Butts St., Annan.</note> to read. I think you should call on her with it yourself, and see if you have anything to say that can do her good: your sympathy and the assurance of John&#x2019;s and mine, which you can most honestly offer, will do the unfortunate old Mother good for a moment. You will hear of her at Mrs Dickson&#x2019;s.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving&#x2019;s sister Janet.</note>&#x2014; Or if you absolutely <hi rend="italic">do not like</hi> to go thither, and will not go (&#x201C;when I bid thee!&#x201D;), you can send it thither, with your own regards; and that will do.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s Letter<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1834-12-27">27 Dec.</date></note> came this morning; he is well, doing well, and writes like a kind brother, and a good man. Let us be thankful for him; and that he prospers and grows.&#x2014; Jean&#x2019;s Dumfries Letter<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1834-12-23">23 Dec.</date></note> reached me before my last to you was well out of the house; and gave me great comfort: tell her so, &#x26; that I am much obliged. When I get a moment&#x2019;s breathing-time, I will repay her. Mary&#x2019;s Newspaper, since that, told me you were <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, and well: the Giver of Good be thanked for it!&#x2014;&#x2014; I am behindhand with Jack&#x2019;s correspondence; he has read my last Letter: but I will now not lose a post whatever come of it. I wanted to be done with the first Section (perhaps first Volume, for I am looking that way now) of my poor Book: but the <foreign><hi rend="italic">dreighness</hi></foreign> [tediousness] <pb id="pg-08-4" n="08:4"/>of it proves astonishing. I toil along, not overworking myself; <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> a little. Between 2 and 4 o&#x2019;clock I walk every day; wrapt in my Cloak, which is the warmest article I ever wore, and would defy Greenland itself. The fogs are not nearly so bad this winter; in any case, far slighter here than in the Town, where not only <hi rend="italic">mist</hi> is to be struggled with, but every abominable vapour that the soul of man can conceive.&#x2014; Jane&#x2019;s foot after a most tedious business is recovered; so that she can take her walks again; and keep the house tighter about us. The Servant I said is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pluister</hi></foreign> [clumsy person]; but that is her sole fault; she can work resolutely to order, and is the best-natured of women: the outcry on London Servants excels even that in Scotland on Scotch: weak as sparrows, to be fed like fighting cocks, disobedient, dishonest: we think of trying the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pluister</hi></foreign> a while yet. Allan Cunningham told us a while ago (what I have often said), he had thoughts of trying it <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>, or with &#x201C;rolls and ale,&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably meaning either that he meant to try being a servant himself, or doing without one by living on just bread and beer.</note> for his soul was sick of it. The state of Society here, in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> aspects, indicates, I think, that the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of it cannot be very distant.&#x2014; Alas, dear M<supplied>[other]</supplied>, the paper is done; and I know I have forgotten so (turn to the top)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Here Carlyle goes to the top margin as he has just indicated in brackets; similarly, just below, he indicates that his addition is squeezed into the margin. There was no room for a signature, and the last four sentences have been squeezed in gaps between paragraphs once the page was full.</note> many things. When my first volume is done, I am for a short <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>: then you shall hear about me again. The Book is not to be so bad a Book: take comfort with me in that!&#x2014; But what are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> doing dear Mother? (to the margin) Are you spinning, reading, visiting? Will my dressing-gown be ready, if the Book be? Above all, are you well? Jane<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle has written &#x201C;Jean&#x201D; above, meaning his sister.</note> says your little room is wonderfully comfortable; which comforted me to hear. I hope to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it in summer.&#x2014; Can my new Sister not help you to make out a sheet for me?&#x2014; Good night, dear Mother! Is Alick&#x2019;s farm settled yet?&#x2014; Jane is gone out, or her love were sent <hi rend="italic">in words</hi> too. Love to all from Alick to Jenny. I must end, or you will never get it read.</p>

<salute>My Dear Friend,</salute>
<p>Our Elections<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Melbourne ministry had been dismissed in <date when="1834-11-00">November</date> (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341025-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:321</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-10-25">25 Oct. 1834</date></corr></ref>). Peel and Wellington had taken office, only to be compelled to call a general election in <date when="1835-01-00">January</date> (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341224-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:358</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-12-24">24 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>). This began in the first week in <date when="1835-01-00">January</date>, was decided in London by the <date when="1835-01-10">10th</date>, and straggled on generally for the next fortnight. The times were uncertain but Carlyle was too apocalyptic. The radicals increased their representation to about 150 seats and gained all the seats in London. The conservatives gained 100 yet lacked a firm majority; there were about 200 whigs. After Parliament reassembled, Peel was beaten six times in six weeks, and on <date when="1835-04-18">18 April</date>, Melbourne became Prime Minister again.</note> being concluded, and a frank attainable, I now send you this melancholy scrap of print. The Bookseller has kept his promise to the eye rather than to the hope: However such as I have you get, and will give it welcome. It stood beside some other stuff about poor Edward, written by Henry Drummond, or some one, which I thought you would care little for seeing.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;Death of the Rev. Edward Irving&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi>. The first article, under the same title, was not by Henry Drummond but by B. W. Procter.</note> I send another for Mrs. Irving under cover to Scotsbrig: my Mother&#x2019;s one cannot go this time, owing to Post-office <hi rend="italic">owners</hi>; for there is a letter from Italy too (wherein the Doctor, in perfectly good heart, makes honourable mention of you, and affectionate inquiry): my Mother gets no more paper than yourself; so hard are we run.</p>
<p>I toil night and day at that <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>; which I hope will amuse you for eight and forty hours by and by. If we live, you shall see it. My sole prayer is that it too were done: it is the hardest work (such an <hi rend="italic">armful</hi> I take of it) I have had for long. The first <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> or perhaps first <hi rend="italic">volume</hi> (for I am thinking of <hi rend="italic">three</hi> now) will be finished when you read this. Give me your <hi rend="italic">Good-speed!</hi> Nay I know I have it, from the heart. &#x201C;Girt with dark tempests,&#x201D; says a German friend of mine, &#x201C;or sailing thro&#x2019; the serene blue, our Mother, old Earth, seen or unseen of the central Sun, holds on her <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> way, and over as the day has finished the course: so be it with man, her child!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. H. Voss (<date when="1751-00-00">1751</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>), cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350430-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-04-30">30 April</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Had the Earth lungs, a stomach, and were not <foreign><hi rend="italic">boss</hi></foreign> [hollow], she would cough a little (<foreign><hi rend="italic">peck</hi></foreign> [<foreign><hi rend="italic">pech</hi></foreign>, or wheeze] a little)&#x2014;in London fogs! However, I walk valiantly some two hours daily; and get along not so ill.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-6" n="08:6"/>Politics run mountain-high: my own interest therein is as <hi rend="italic">zero;</hi> but the prophecy I give is black. What were the wager that Wellington lived yet to lose his head? God help him,&#x2014;and the rest of us.&#x2014; Send me plenty of Annandale news: be of good cheer, and remember me!</p>
<closer><salute>Yours always,&#x2014; /</salute></closer> <name>(Signed) T. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>Kind Newyear&#x2019;s regards and wishes to Mrs. Howatson,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham&#x2019;s sister.</note> and Miss Grahame: may the worst of our years (above all, the <hi rend="italic">wickedest</hi> of them) be done! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu!</foreign></salute></closer></p>
<p>I fell in singularly with Currie<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently James Currie, son of the Currie who had said of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s ta use on &#x2019;t? naebody can tell what he would be at,&#x201D; according to WG to TC, <date when="1834-12-17">17 Dec. 1834</date>. Graham added that James Currie, the son, liked and understood <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> so well &#x201C;that it seems to have new-modelled his style of letter-writing.

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Can you thro&#x2019; any of your triumphing Reformers procure me a frank? It contains printed paper, and an Italian Letter for my Mother.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently for <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350110-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC <date when="1835-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref>, and its enclosures.</note> The Grocer declares it to be <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> an ounce, not more nor less: I think Members have a little Balance by them, that will tell better; in the unfavourable case, pray return it by the Twopenny post (dated a day later), and I will lighten it. What trouble I give you!</p>
<p>I begin also to be quite ashamed about those Newspapers; tho&#x2019; I do not yet <hi rend="italic">forbid</hi> you.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill sent several newspapers, including the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, to Carlyle, who then forwarded them to his mother. See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341224-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:357</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-12-24">24 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref> and Mineka, XII, 260.</note></p>

Ours is a very ridiculous-lugubrious world.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had written: &#x201C;So that, for the Poet, what remains but to leave Conservative and Destructive pulling one another&#x2019;s locks and ears off.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Works.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, X (<date when="1832-08-00">Aug. 1832</date>), 43 and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 441.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your last Letter came on Saturday, your prior one had been here (or rather in our Mother&#x2019;s hand) some three weeks: I was reproachfully reminded that I had delayed so long; I write now without loss of a post, sorry if I have even run the risk of giving you uneasiness. The truth is, I had privately determined to be done with a certain portion of my Book first; and that has spun itself out in the most unexpected way: so that I still write some <hi rend="italic">three days</hi> off the end. It is <pb id="pg-08-8" n="08:8"/>on the whole perhaps as well; for I can now wind up all matters at once: nay, as it chanced, I had a Letter this very day from our Mother,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1835-01-09">9 Jan.</date></note> and can give you the latest &#x201C;all-well&#x201D; from Annandale too. My Paper you see is decidedly improved (the best I have had for months, and a kind I will stick by): my morning&#x2019;s writing lies safe in the drawer; tea is away. I will make you amends if possible.</p>
<p>Our Mother&#x2019;s Letter is mostly written with her own hand; but contains two Postscripts by Jamie and by Alick, who had just returned from Annan market: the tone of the whole is cheery and animating. Jean had sent me a word, some three weeks before, of the same character. My mother says, &#x201C;I like to hear our good Doctor in that thoughtful strain he is in. When think you he will be home? I trust you will all come and see us this summer, God willing.&#x201D; Her little room looks quite cheerful (by Jean&#x2019;s testimony too) with the new window in it; she keeps on &#x201C;roaring fires&#x201D;; and &#x201C;Sandy was so kind as to send me a cask of excellent strong ale to comfort my heart.&#x201D; &#x201C;Plenty of reading&#x201D;; &#x201C;quite snug and warm, and wish every one were as well.&#x201D; Alick had been down a few nights before, and was very merry, they had &#x201C;store of songs.&#x201D; He had come, that Thursday his own postscript was written on, for &#x201C;half of a beef-cow Jamie had been killing.&#x201D; You see the whole of their simple <foreign><hi rend="italic">kleine Welt</hi></foreign> [little world] in these phrases, and will rejoice with me in the simple wholesome thriving of it. I had despatched your Letter towards Scotsbrig (Mill, I think, would get it franked tonight), so that one good turn will be answered by another. Alick <hi rend="italic">expected</hi> with some confidence to get one settlement or another with his Land-owning people; seemed rather to think it would be an <hi rend="italic">abatement</hi>, and continuance; was cheerfully prepared either way. He says he is no poorer, nor worse any way, and the world is wide, and &#x201C;ay life in it for a living body.&#x201D; Mary with her new daughter (called Jesse<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean&#x2019;s spelling is &#x201C;Jessie&#x201D; in her letter of <date when="1834-12-23">23 Dec. 1834</date>.</note>) was doing well, and her husband employed; Jane and her <hi rend="italic">Alick</hi> the same;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Born <date when="1834-09-19">19 Sept. 1834</date>, died <date when="1836-04-18">18 April 1836</date>.</note> <hi rend="italic">her</hi> James had bought Uncle John&#x2019;s house (Academy Street) for &#xa3;360; paid what he could of it, and was to pay interest for the rest. James of Scotsbrig sticks exclusively to <hi rend="italic">general history;</hi> but seems lively and in good heart; able to &#x201C;go on as usual,&#x201D; the farm produce of all kinds is excessively cheap.&#x2014; There was no other Annandale news, except this: the death <pb id="pg-08-9" n="08:9"/>of poor little Edward Scott;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1834-12-31">31 Dec.</date>, p. 4; he was 27, &#x201C;a native of Ecclefechan &#x2026; highly esteemed for his many virtues.&#x201D;</note> which I had noticed in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, but had no particulars of. My Mother says, &#x201C;he was nearly starved in coming home from Africa,&#x201D; and survived only a fortnight with his Brothers at Liverpool. This seems to indicate that he had gone out on some subaltern surgency, and for the rest perished tragically. Not very many months ago, I heard of him in Ecclefechan; he had fallen from a gallopping horse in the Langlands: poor innocent <foreign>lad</foreign> (for I remember his face well), he was near darker journeyings&#x2014;into cruel paths and the Shadow of Death! <hi rend="italic">He</hi> also is gone.</p>
<p>Your Letters, my dear Jack, are always a great comfort to me: with your brotherly affection and trueheartedness, you are one of the best possessions I have. Always a shelter for me, in the background, whether I retire, if not to safety and covert, yet to sympathy, and the precious assurance of sharing what covert there is. For, be certain, I will <hi rend="italic">share</hi>, if need be; it were but poor pride to resolve otherwise: with you, alone of men, such a thing were possible: am I not rich that it is so? Nay, it is to you only that I can so much as complain: my true Annandalians (<foreign><hi rend="italic">meine Getreuen</hi></foreign> [my faithful ones]) would but in vain afflict themselves with my cares; other heart there is not in the world that would even very honestly do that. My friends here admit cheerfully that I am a very heroic man,&#x2014;that must understand the art (to them unhappily unknown) of <hi rend="italic">living upon nothing!</hi> Mill, I think, alone of them, would make any great effort to help me; I find him really assiduously serviceable: but he is so <hi rend="italic">theoretic</hi> a man, and like a printed Book, I never open myself to him: besides we meet only some once in the fortnight, or seldomer. At Mrs Austin&#x2019;s one may see floods of people; but people barren as the East wind; she herself is dissipating all away into <hi rend="italic">spray</hi> of gossip, almost a terror to one: I go once in the month or so, for mere civility. As to <hi rend="italic">heroism</hi> (bless the mark!) I think often of the old rhyme: &#x201C;There was a piper had a cow, / And he had nocht to give her; / He took his pipes and played a spring / And <hi rend="italic">bade the cow consider!</hi>&#x201D; &#x26;c.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340815-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:269</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-08-15">15 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; In a word, my prospects here are not sensibly brightening; if it be not in this, That the longer I live among the people, the deeper grows my feeling (not a vain one; a sad one) of natural superiority over them; of being able (were the <hi rend="italic">tools</hi> in my hand!) to do a hundred things better than the hundred I see paid for doing them. In bright days, I say: <pb id="pg-08-10" n="08:10"/>It is <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> but I must by and by strike into something! In dark days, I say: And suppose, nothing? My sentiment is a kind of sacred defiance of the whole matter; a <foreign><hi rend="italic">verachtung, ja Nicht-achtung</hi></foreign> [disdain, indeed scorn]. In this humour, I write my Book; without hope of it, except of being <hi rend="italic">done with it:</hi> properly beginning to as good as feel that Literature has <hi rend="italic">gone mad</hi> in this country, and will not yield food to any honest cultivator of it. For example, as I see it is: if this Book ever prosper, the issue will be, applications in mad superabundance from able Editors to write Articles for them (&#x201C;with my heart&#x2019;s blood,&#x201D; as you sympathetically say) for perhaps <hi rend="italic">six months;</hi> then a total cessation:&#x2014;tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">I myself</hi> am abler to write Articles than ever, that is nothing; they are off after &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">any</hi> new thing,&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Acts. 17:21.</note> and you stand wondering, alone on the beach. As to &#x201C;fame&#x201D; again, and &#x201C;distinguished men,&#x201D; I declare to thee, Jack, a &#x201C;distinguished man&#x201D; (but above all extant things, a distinguished woman) is a character I had rather not <hi rend="italic">see</hi>; and &#x201C;fame&#x201D; (with such miserable cobwebs as gain it most,&#x2014;and are burnt up by it) is heartily worth <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to me; nay sometimes, with pious thought, I feel it a mercy that I have it not. Who knows whether it would not calcine me too; drive me too mad? A Newspaper Editor can gain a living: I too could be a Newspaper Editor (the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> one comes here sometimes; a very decent little fellow, who knew me three years ago<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill&#x2019;s friend John Wilson: see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321016-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:242</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-10-16">16 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note>); but have small stomach for it, in these distracted times. Literature, then, does not invite me. Sometimes I say to myself: Surely, friend, Providence, if ever it did warn, warns thee to have done with Literature, which will neither yield thee bread, nor stomach to digest bread! I will sum up my speculations by one anecdote, which will tell you much: There is a scheme here for carrying out a Colony of superabundant Labourers<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1834-08-00">Aug. 1834</date> a bill was passed establishing the new colony of South Australia; and the South Australia Association (including Buller, Grote and Molesworth) was formed to found the colony on the principles of Edward Gibbon Wakefield (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>): i.e., with the careful regulation and encouragement of emigration, and the sale of land at a fixed price, the money from which was to go to an emigration fund for poor laborers.</note> (<hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the only two public enterprizes that seem to me worth engaging in; that of <hi rend="italic">teaching</hi> the people is the other): over this scheme a certain Colonel Napier was to preside, go out as Governor;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles James Napier (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), who had fought in the Peninsular War, and while the British representative in Cephalonia, <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>, had sympathised with the Greeks in their war of independence but refused to become their commander. At this time, Buller wanted him as Governor of the new colony, which he was ready to be on certain terms: the provision of 200 soldiers, a warship and the right to draw on a fund of &#xa3;100,000 for the colonists in case of distress. The Colonial Office did not agree. Napier was a radical in politics, as he shows in his <hi rend="italic">Colonisation, particularly in Southern Australia</hi> (London, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), p. 96. &#x201C;We rob the natives of their land, we rob them of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> food &#x2026; and we not only shoot, but torture them for our diversion; and finally, we say, that they are incapable of civilisation. &#x2026; We denominate ourselves a <hi rend="italic">civilized</hi> people, because we set up what we term &#x2018;national wealth,&#x2019; as our God &#x2026; and make large mercantile fortunes, by the wholesale murder of infants in our manufactures.&#x201D; Nevertheless he was appointed Major-General in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, and in <date when="1839-03-00">March 1839</date> commander of the Northern district in the Chartist troubles. Later famous for his achievements in Upper and Lower Sind, India.</note> and <pb id="pg-08-11" n="08:11"/>I heeded it hardly at all. One day, however, in the Newspaper, I came upon an extract from Napier&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of the Peninsular War</hi>,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Francis Patrick Napier (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), <hi rend="italic">History of the War in the Peninsula and in the South of France from the year <date when="1807-00-00">1807</date> to the year <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date></hi>, 6 vols. (London, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>). Carlyle probably saw an extract from vol. 4 (<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>).</note> and found, to my amazement, that this Napier was actually a man (not the sham of a man), with a strong head, a valiant heart; a &#x201C;clang in him as of <hi rend="italic">steel</hi>&#x201D;: I remember also that Buller was intimate with him. What did I do? Took my stick silently the second night, and strode off to Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields; resolute that Buller should bring us into contact! I would finish my Book first; then (with wildpealing heart) go over the seas, to spend and be spent; happy at least in having companionship with man, in having work and food! From Buller I learnt, without hinting at my project, that <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Napier was not my Napier (of the Newspaper Extract) but a Brother, of whom I knew nothing. I told Jane of my adventurous humour, for the first time, when I came home: you here, for the second time.&#x2014; I know some Engineers and Architects (the Rennie Squadron):<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rennie, see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220100-JBW-EA-01"><sic>2:17</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1822-01-15">15 Jan. 1822</date></corr></ref>, and probably his cousins Sir John (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>), knighted <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> on completion of London Bridge to his father John&#x2019;s design, and George Rennie (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), both civil engineers.</note> once or twice, I have dreamt of trying that. My thinking faculty was not to sleep (far from that), nor even my speaking one; nay I should learn much, above all, get into health, and write much nearer <hi rend="italic">wisely</hi> than I can do now. Unluckily I am forty years of age; and have sworn defensive and offensive league with Realities, everlasting war with Shams, at least resolute non-alliance with such! A practical friend were of great use to me: had the poor Duke (whom you inquire after) but been able to go on! Unluckily he could not; we had one Letter (Jane had), in the old intolerable strain (reprimanding you, for the thousandth time, for not being &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">happy</hi>&#x201D;) which remains 
<pb id="pg-08-12" n="08:12"/>unanswered these four months.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey, who had written to Jane on <date when="1834-09-08">8 Sept. 1834</date>: &#x201C;For Mercy&#x2019;s sake let us be friends still. &#x2026; I daresay I have been too harsh and peremptory&#x2014;and I humbly ask your pardon if you still think so.&#x201D; On happiness he said, &#x201C;that to be happy, and to make happy, is the chief end of man&#x2014;,&#x201D; and about his new position on the Scottish Bench, &#x201C;I take reasonably well to my new Judicial functions&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I must confess I enjoy the vacation more than the working times&#x2014;and that I have not yet entirely ceased to mourn for the call of London.&#x201D;</note> Mrs Welsh says he is reputed &#x201C;to be getting silly.&#x201D; I did not send him <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k (and fear I have offended him thereby), but mean to send him my next: I really love the little man, and mourn that he must leave me. Must; for he would not let me live, unless I became a Sceptic and Edinburgh dilettante, made money, and was &#x201C;happy.&#x201D; How happy is he!</p>
<p>Now, dear Doctor, if here is not enough of complaining; the faithfullest picture of all my <foreign><hi rend="italic">tristia</hi></foreign> [sadness]! Nevertheless dream not, my Boy, that it is all wreckage with me, not a whit of it! Like Doctor Bowring<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310208-TC-JOBO-01"><sic>5:227</sic><corr>TC to JOBO, <date when="1831-02-08">8 Feb. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> (one of the chief quacks going here) &#x201C;I am calm but energetic:&#x201D; I am writing really a very surprising kind of Book, <hi rend="italic">hitting</hi> bits of the truth in it; and care not a snuff generally for the Devil and the world. It is, after all, pe<supplied>[rhaps]</supplied> not so bad a Book; only I get along at a frightful pace, and it swells on me: I think of <hi rend="italic">three</hi> small volumes now; and am about ending the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> (perhaps almost the size of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>). Small praise will it look for; at best, much censure: but as I said, I shall be <hi rend="italic">done with it</hi>. I speak as much as possible in the dialect of this lower world; yet it is wonderfully unlike a this-world&#x2019;s Book: Jane says it will do; and Mill; no other knows of it.&#x2014; Thousand thanks for the good you get of <hi rend="italic">Teufel!</hi> A few such voices are real <hi rend="italic">votes</hi>, and outweigh all the babble or no-babble that is, was, or will be. I meant the thing for what you <hi rend="italic">find</hi> it in some measure to be. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Getroffen</hi></foreign> [A hit; Bullseye]! therefore is the word; and I am right well pleased.&#x2014; Let me add only, for your farther consolation, that we have still some &#xa3;230 hard money; and can stand out handsomely twelve months <hi rend="italic">without</hi> farther supply of any kind; and wait and look, all that time, what the hours will bring.&#x2014; I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine; as good as formally: I wrote a two pages (headed &#x201C;Death of Edward Irving,&#x201D; which stands printed in last Number); but amid such a jumble as makes me pause aghast. Nay Doctor Maginn who has evidently a sneaking pique at me thought good in a fearful thing he called &#x201C;the Fraserians&#x201D; to introduce &#x201C;Carlyle&#x201D; speaking nonsensical <pb id="pg-08-13" n="08:13"/>Scotch: Blackwood-Hogg to Paddy Maginn!<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Hogg, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:89</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>. Carlyle refers here to William Maginn, &#x201C;The Fraserians; or, The Commencement of the Year Thirty-five. A Fragment,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XI (<date when="1835-01-00">Jan. 1835</date>), 10: &#x201C;On this occasion it pleased Carlyle to expound his ideas of song-writing. &#x2018;A sang &#x2026; is but the outward vesture of twa, or at maist three, isoterically-combinated thochts, in the extrinsical wrapping of I ken-na what arbitrarily-devised syllabication of to-be-sung-to-wind-or-touch-instrument numbers. As the divine Goethe observes&#x2014;&#x2019; An universal catarrh seemed to have seized on the room at the mention of this venerable name.&#x201D; Maginn tries to echo the &#x201C;Notes Ambrosianae&#x201D; of <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi> in which Hogg featured, and in which it had been said (XXXI, <date when="1832-04-00">April 1832</date>, p. 694) that Carlyle was &#x201C;entitled to be crazy&#x2014;being a man of genius. &#x2026; He always writes as if &#x2019;twere impossible to be ignorant of Goethe and to know Nature.&#x201D;</note> It was a thing &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be repeated&#x201D; (as I briefly wrote to Fraser); nay to <hi rend="italic">pull noses</hi> for, if it were repeated. We rest there upon our oars; and I think the poor drunken scrub of a Doctor will steer clear of me in future: otherwise (as Allan Cunningham once threatened the same man), one must &#x201C;kick him down to Charing Cross,&#x201D;&#x2014;if no easier remedy turn up. The wooden James is probably much surprised at my touchy contempt for his Doctor; an innocent kind of creature James, with cockney precision, a kind of honesty; becoming cockney-dandiacal; like to get (commercially) <hi rend="italic">drowned</hi> one day in that &#x201C;drunk man&#x2019;s vomit&#x201D; of an (Irish) Magazine of his. Whether he will or shall publish my Book? I can <hi rend="italic">get</hi> it done.</p>
<p>But now, a word of Rome. Nothing gives me such pleasure, my dear Jack, as to learn that you have settled that Practice matter (very reasonably, I think), and have even got some patients. Hold by that: watch it with open eyes; it is better than all Books. Such a kind of life is the very health of you. Doubt not, either, that you will find work to do: work in all climates of the world has he who can alleviate disease! At worst, &#x201C;a good physician saves if not from the disease, yet from the bad physician.&#x201D;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richter, untraced; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:316</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> Whether you should return to Rome, or stay in England?

I noticed also what you said (judiciously, in German) about <hi rend="italic">my</hi> <pb id="pg-08-14" n="08:14"/>coming to Rome!

I could follow my <hi rend="italic">other</hi> work, as well as anywhere; and perhaps the climate were far better for me. We will dandle it for moments, now and then, as a Dream! This Country I take to be on the edge of perilous (perhaps bloody) strife; confusion; it may be, dissolution and chaos: <hi rend="italic">rottenness</hi> is written over it thro&#x2019; every relation of man to man. Is the End come then? It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> coming, and was: God alone knows! But for me any work is not Revolution; at least not Hunger-revolution (for that is the melancholy truth of it): if they set up any kind of guillotine, I will be off, I think!

<p><salute>My dear Brother.</salute> Your affectionate letter is the greatest comfort we have had this new year. Otherwise it has been rather a detestable one. I said to Carlyle some weeks ago &#x201C;I am resolved to make a little fun this Christmas for our Christmases for a long while back have been so doleful.&#x201D; &#x201C;I shall be particularly delighted said he if you can realize any fun&#x201D; Well the next morning at breakfast my Maid poured a quantity of boiling water on my foot in consequence of which, and I think also of improper applications, I have been confined to the house five weeks! The most of that time indebted to Carlyle for carrying me <pb id="pg-08-15" n="08:15"/>out of one room into another. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Willis did me good by a light bandage and I am now moving about again but hardly with my usual alacrity. This is the reason why I have not yet been to return Miss Morris&#x2019;s call. Mrs Montagu wrote me a sentimental effusion on the death of Edward Irving <hi rend="italic">threatening</hi> as heretofore to come and see me but has not been yet. nor will not: the only pity is that she will not let the matter lie quite dormant. It is not worth telling so many lies about. Emily is in Italy&#x2014;with some great relations.<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emily Montagu (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271120-TC-ADBM-01"><sic>4:283</sic><corr>TC to ADBM, <date when="1827-11-20">20 Nov. 1827</date></corr></ref>).</note> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Austin sends me occasional &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">threepennies</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters costing threepence to send.</note> overflowing with &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dearests</hi>&#x201D; and all that, asks me to her <foreign><hi rend="italic">soir&#xE9;es</hi></foreign> now and then, and even flashes down here in wheeled vehicles at rare intervals&#x2014; But what is all this to one who really longs for a little sincere friendship?

In short dear Doctor I am hardly better off for society than at Craig o&#x2019; putta. Not so well off as when you were there walking with me and reading Ariosto. So hasten back and let us read Ariosto again, and what else may turn up for us<supplied>[.]</supplied> I could act out of all patience with life when I look round me on such floods of selfish sentimentality and pretentious inanity; if it were not for the grateful sense I have of the worth of my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> people.

<salute>My dear Alick</salute>
<p>It is long since I got you written to with any deliberation; I know not how long. I have been so busy; nothing but flying slips of paper, and blotting and scribbling all round me for week after week. However, now for the last eight days, I have been making a sort of pause; occupied only with reading and reflecting: so before falling-to again, I will send you a small word. You may well fancy, judging no doubt by yourself, that I am often, often thinking of you while no writing goes between us: indeed, whither should my mind turn, when it has leisure to meditate, if <hi rend="italic">not</hi> towards Annandale, where so much of my possessions in this lower world lies? Believe it, my dear Brother, there is nothing that can banish you out of my thoughts; as I know there is nothing can banish me out of yours. However, a line of writing now and then is indispensable too; and if there is any request I have to make of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, it is that you would stir yourself up a little in that matter; for sometimes I feel myself rather scantily furnished, or at least have felt, for I think we are getting better on of late. You need not say at any time that you are not in the mood, that you have nothing to say &#x26;c &#x26;c: all these are devices of the Evil Principle; your plan is to seize the moment such as it may be; to sit down and <hi rend="italic">say</hi> <pb id="pg-08-17" n="08:17"/>that same &#x201C;nothing,&#x201D; which you will find on trial to be a very tolerable &#x201C;Something.&#x201D;</p>
<p>My Mother&#x2019;s last Letter came the very day I had sent off a hasty scrap to her. The various postscripts, and notices contained in that welcome sheet gave me a clear notion of Scotsbrig, with the winter work you were all busy in: I was particularly glad to hear you had been down shortly before, and that &#x201C;singing&#x201D; had been going on among you. Long be the like among us! You cannot imagine how quiet and cheery all that looks from amid the confused din of this Metropolitan Monstrosity! Here, least of all places on Earth&#x2019;s surface, quiet never is; a raging and a roaring; all men hunted or hunting; all things &#x201C;made like unto a <hi rend="italic">wheel</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 83:13.</note>&#x2014;that turns and turns. I have grown greatly used to it now; and for most part walk the London Streets as if they were peopled only with Images, and the noise were that of some Niagara waterfall, or distracted universal carding-mill. There is something animating in it too; so that in my walks I <hi rend="italic">generally</hi> turn Townwards, and go up thro&#x2019; a larger or shorter circuit of real London Tumult (hereabouts we are not much noisier than in the stiller parts of Edinburgh, and in <hi rend="italic">our street</hi> at 10 at night and later there is no noise at all): for &#x201C;man likes to see the face of man&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech?</note> one&#x2019;s very dispiritment in these peopled spaces is nothing to the gloom of Puttoch. My shortest turn (for I have various of various lengths) is to Hyde Park Corner; where I see Quality Carriages, six-horse waggons (horses all jingling with little bells), mail coaches &#x26;c &#x26;c; and the Duke of Wellington&#x2019;s House, the windows all barred with iron (since the Reform-bill time), and huge iron railing twenty feet high between him and the street, which, as the railing is lined with wood too, he does not seem to <hi rend="italic">like:</hi> there are carriages sometimes about his gate now; and I bless myself that I am not he.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wellington had created iron shutters after the windows of Apsley House had been broken by pre-reform crowds in <date when="1831-04-00">April</date> and <date when="1831-10-00">Oct., 1831</date>, and the glass had not been replaced until the Waterloo banquet in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>. Thereafter, to the end of his life, the Duke would raise his hat and point ironically to them if the crowd began cheering him.</note> Let me mention also that there is a waggoner occasionally passes this door (of Cheyne Row), whose voice to his horses &#x201C;Way-ho!&#x201D; infallibly brings me in mind of one I have heard 300 miles off and more.&#x2014; Alas <hi rend="italic">this</hi> will never do; the sheet almost done!</p>
<p>Has the Catlinns business got itself settled yet? I was very glad to learn that there was some prospect of its soon being settled; and, <pb id="pg-08-18" n="08:18"/>on the whole, not sorry that you expected they might make it eligible for you to stay there.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1834-11-20">20 Nov. 1834</date> Alick had told his brother that his request for a reduction of rent had been refused. On <date when="1835-01-09">9 Jan.</date> he had said that there was hope that a &#x201C;settlement&#x201D; could be made. But it was not.</note> Staying is always best, if one can stay; there is such <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> every way in removing; waste of time, of money, of habit and connexions: &#x201C;three <foreign>flittings</foreign> [movings] are equal to a fire.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial, &#x201C;Two <foreign>flittings</foreign> are as bad as one fire,&#x201D; Francis Grose, <hi rend="italic">A Provincial Glossary</hi> (London, <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>).</note> But any way you seem to take it in the right mood: that of courage and patient faith. There is no fear in that case. The world is wide as you say; and there is a Heaven above us go where we will.&#x2014; Make my respects to little Tom; and have him speaking a mouthful of Annandale Scotch when I come back: Jane I daresay is a strapping <foreign><hi rend="italic">hizzy</hi></foreign> [<foreign>lassie</foreign>] by this time, and able to bear her share in any dialogue. Be careful of them, poor creatures; and, above and before all things, study to train them in the way that they should go.</p>
<p>My own history here may be summed up in very few words. I have finished my &#x201C;First Part,&#x201D; which may possibly make a First Volume; and am about beginning <supplied>[the]</supplied> Second and then the Third. On the whole, I am about <hi rend="italic">half</hi> done; for a great dea<supplied>[l of]</supplied> the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> is laid in. I shall have a tough struggle however; all the way till the summer be come. Other work or thought I do not much occupy myself with: this is the day&#x2019;s task and is sufficient for the day. The hopes I have of it are not very high; tho&#x2019; I firmly believe with old Johnson that &#x201C;useful diligence will at last prevail&#x201D;;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Johnson, penultimate paragraph of preface to <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>).</note> and in that spirit I work. We have money to go on with for some twelve months yet; and I calculate that several other shifts may open before then. Literature generally, I am sorry to see, continues as unproductive, distracted, as I fancied it would: my own private surmise is that no honest and reasonably comfortable living can henceforth be made of it: in which case, however, one must simply wish it good day, and try <hi rend="italic">another</hi> thing. The poor people all round me are very silly people for most part, and do not work more stiffly than I: yet do not I see them all live? By God&#x2019;s blessing I calculate that the Spirit of Dishonesty <hi rend="italic">shall not</hi> get dominion over me; nor the Spirit of Despondency, nor any other evil Spirit; in which case all will and must be <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. There are many people kind to me, and many that seem to think far more of me than I merit; but it is not in them I trust. On the whole, I do often feel as if all that hindered one were in reality a blessed <pb id="pg-08-19" n="08:19"/>furtherance towards something better. Let a man toil diligently; cast his bread upon the waters, he shall find it after many days.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 11:1.</note>&#x2014; But, alas, my dear Boy, the sheet is done. I will hope for another chance soon; and in the meantime pray you to bear in mind that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are now clearly my debtor, and that before the ploughing get too hot, you are actually bound to write to me. Send <hi rend="italic">all</hi> manner of news: about yourself and household, about my Mother, about every one dear to me. My Mother said you had got her a &#x201C;cask of good ale.&#x201D; It was right well done: I thank you as if you had given myself a puncheon. I hope you go and see her often; and will get her in motion again now when the days are lengthening. This spring weather brings me in mind of many things. Jane is gone to bed; or she would <hi rend="italic">expressly</hi> send her love. She had a baddish time of it with that foot but is better now.&#x2014; We have not seen Leigh Hunt for almost 3 months! There was no quarrel either; but I believe the poor man is very miserable, and feels shocked at my rigorous Presbyterian principles; in short is afraid of me! I pity him much; but think too, he is perhaps as well where he <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, and I where I am. <closer><salute>Good night my dear Alick! Love to Jenny and the <foreign>Bairns</foreign>.</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>You should by all means go and see Grahame: you will find <supplied>[him]</supplied> most kindly disposed towards you.

<salute>My Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I have been in your debt for a Letter, which came most acceptably,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1834-12-23">23 Dec 1834</date>.</note> and which I did not at the time mean to owe you for so long: my delay, as I hope you have never doubted, arose from occupation, from want of news, from anything but want of care about you. I have an evening to myself just now, and, as I can hope also for a frank, you shall have the benefit of such opportunity.</p>
<p>It gave us great satisfaction to hear that you were safe, and had realised a little Boy, of whom we have learnt since from various quarters to entertain a hopeful opinion. Nourish up the little Alick with all diligence; that he grow to be a man profitable in his day and generation! Our work in it will be over by and by; and his be beginning. Mrs Welsh saw you and him and James, and sent us word about it; she subsequently also sent to you for news (she told us), but your own Letter was just coming off. Or perhaps I am confusing all manner of dates here? For the truth is, I have sat so chained to my writing-table these many weeks; that much of the outer world often seems to me almost like a dream.</p>
<p>James, I think has very likely done well to purchase himself a house.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >That they were buying from old John Aitken. See also <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360205-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA <date when="1836-02-05">5 Feb. 1836</date></ref>.</note> You will find yourself much more comfortable in a &#x201C;bit <foreign>haddin</foreign> [dwelling] of your ain for a that&#x201D;; indeed, I imagine the house is of itself far better than your present one; besides it tends to give the Goodman a Kind of consistency in his Trade; and so I hope every way will turn to good. He has a fair proportion of business, I understand &#x201C;the hand of the diligent&#x201D; had long ago the best word;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 10:4.</note> and even in these times shall not be altogether foiled. I hope all that is favourable of you both; to hear that you live not as fools but as wise: that is the grand blessing for this world and for the next.</p>
<p>As to myself, having already told you of sitting over my papers, and struggling with my evil genius there, I have hardly anything more to say that is important. My health stands out very tolerably, tho&#x2019; it is the most unwholesome craft: it is true, I am faithful in walking <pb id="pg-08-21" n="08:21"/>and so forth, and we have generally weather one can walk in. I do not think I ever saw a year with less than <hi rend="italic">six</hi> times as much rain: this is a far drier climate than yours, and the present season, moreover, has been unusually dry. In other respects, all goes as it was wont, or nearly so. We have a few friends that come about us, and might very easily have more <hi rend="italic">visitors</hi> if not friends; but find no profit in that: the good are <hi rend="italic">thin-sawn</hi> [thin-sown] everywhere, and perhaps not thicker here than elsewhere, tho&#x2019; there are <hi rend="italic">more</hi> to choose among. The quantity of <hi rend="italic">folly</hi> in all shapes that one finds here is really amazing. Gabble-gabble in every kind under the sun except the <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> kind: the reasons are &#x201C;like two wheat-grains in the bushel of chaff.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Merchant of Venice,</hi> I, i.</note> We must even let it go on, as it has done, and will do; it can, on the whole, &#x201C;di&#x2019; tha naither ill na guid.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280420-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:369</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-04-20">20 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> At lowest it is my happiness, as it was of that joiner friend of James&#x2019;s (whose name I think was Thomson<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either James Thomson, New Fleshmarket Street, or John Thomson, 12 Friar&#x2019;s Vennel.</note>), that if contradiction is like to drive one mad at any time, one can &#x201C;take gay guid care; and ay mostly work in <hi rend="italic">a place by himsel</hi>&#x201D;! I, by the nature of the case, mostly ay work in just such a place.&#x2014; What the fruit of my working is to be we shall not begin to know yet for seven or eight months; or perhaps for not as many years: that is the law of the trade, and we must just abide by it. I do the best I can, and shall pray to be thankful for such reward, or such punishment, as is appointed. One thing alone I am sure of, that if I live I shall <hi rend="italic">have done</hi> with the weary job;&#x2014;and then hope for another that may be easier and more profitable. Probably some of them have told you that the thing was growing on my hands, and threatened to become three volumes! I was to be done in <date when="1835-02-00">February</date> or <date when="1835-03-00">March</date>; and so, if I have it all fairly off my hands by the end of <date when="1835-05-00">May</date> I shall think it very tolerable. But <hi rend="italic">then</hi> indeed, if the guiding Powers continue Kind, Jack will be coming homewards, and we shall have a <foreign><hi rend="italic">gliff</hi></foreign> [glimpse] of Scotland again!

<p>I need not tell you about our Elections and public matters: men have been parading all streets with Election Placards on long poles, or with two <hi rend="italic">poleless</hi> Placards, one on breast and one on back, fastened with string; others have been busy singing Ballads, hawking Political squibs &#x26;c &#x26;c of the like purport; to all which, I have said: Behold I have no care for thee!

<p>Allan Cunningham has been unwell, and I have not seen him for a great while, tho&#x2019; often purposing to do it. He lost a Brother here in Autumn, and seemed to suffer from it:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Mounsey Cunningham (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), clerk to Sir John Rennie; a poet, his most famous poem was &#x201C;The Hills o&#x2019; Gallowa&#x2019;.&#x201D; He had died of cholera, <date when="1834-10-28">28 Oct. 1834</date>.</note> his wife also has lost a Brother resident here.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Walker (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), a cabinet maker from Dumfries; he had died in Pimlico on <date when="1834-12-29">29 Dec. 1834</date>.

<p>My Mother has written me a Letter since yours, with nothing but good news in it.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1835-01-08">8 Jan.</date></note> I fear always she leans to the <hi rend="italic">favourable side</hi>. Your account of her way of doing, the look of her rooms, &#x26;c are very interesting to me, and form the best of what picture I have made out respecting it. She says, last time, you had sent her a cake for Newyear&#x2019;s gift. That was right. O be good to her: I need not bid you, I do believe. She has been a blessing to us; and, I trust in God, will long continue so. When I look over the world, and see what Mothers and Fathers the average have, I feel thankful for mine.&#x2014; She said they had been singing at Scotsbrig; &#x201C;Johnnie O&#x2019;Cox&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340517-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:157</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-17">17 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> was sung too: I am right glad to hear of a song there.</p>
<p>But now, <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi>, I have a commission for you about that. Will you go over to any Stationers shop, and buy half a quire (12 sheets) of <hi rend="italic">ruled</hi> Paper (they have it ruled with blue ink, or can soon rule it); or if one has it not, go to another, and on the whole <hi rend="italic">get</hi> it; and send it out to my Mother for writing to me on. She wants nothing but straight lines to write a most sufficient slow hand; and unless you <pb id="pg-08-23" n="08:23"/>bestir yourself in that way, I see no chance of her securing it. Now will you look to that? See in packing it, that you wrap it <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, and if possible lay it <hi rend="italic">flat</hi> (in some Book if there be such a thing; or between two pasteboards); for otherwise it gets creased, and &#x201C;becomes unpleasant.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I must write some more letters than this; and will not seal till tomorrow: you shall then have &#x201C;time of day&#x201D; again,&#x2014;unless I am too hurried. We are going to dine with the Bullers, who have all taken up their abode in Town, and are very kindly disposed towards us. It is there that I expect a frank; for there will likely be a Radical Member or two present. Charles is becoming a notable in that department; a <foreign><hi rend="italic">liesh</hi></foreign> [active] fellow, were he not so loose in the hinges!&#x2014;&#x2014; Jane is sitting sewing here; she sends you both her Kind Newyears&#x2019;s wishes.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Scarcely was my last hasty Letter out of the door, when your Scotsbrig one, bringing so much comfortable intelligence, came in. I had returned to my work again; and went on with the more alacrity for knowing that you were well. It is now almost ten days since I had done with that section of my task; the next section must very soon be begun; and a fierce struggle I expect with it: but before beginning I will send you a small notice of me; being indeed bound by the mere law of Debtor and Creditor to do it. Jane&#x2019;s Frank will carry this to Dumfries; from which, I hope, it will reach you on Wednesday, and be as cheerfully welcomed as all the rest have been. Besides Jean&#x2019;s Letter, there is one to Alick; and with this sheet of yours the Frank will be full: so that you must excuse me both to Jamie and whoever else has claim against me; assuring them that I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> pay, if they only give me time. Mary I think has some claim for a Note from me; this you may assure her I have not forgotten: say, however, that if she will write another Letter to me soon, her payment shall be all the <hi rend="italic">luckier</hi> (I mean, in the sense of <hi rend="italic">larger</hi>); and that I want really to hear what they think of their Annan life, and how they get on there. Jean told me once they had still some thoughts of farming, and partially an eye to Will Brown&#x2019;s place: I of course know not what is to be said of that speculation, understanding so little about the circumstances; but if they are actually making a livelihood in honesty at Annan, I should recommend them to be <hi rend="italic">cautious</hi> of quitting it: a livelihood is all one has a right to look for in these times, and the rolling of the ball is always sure at least to waste the <foreign><hi rend="italic">fog</hi></foreign> [moss] from it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; cf. the rolling stone gathers no moss. <hi rend="italic">SND</hi>, &#x201C;a rowin&#x2019; stane disna <foreign>fog</foreign>.&#x201D;</note> They I believe can change with as little loss as most; and it may, as well as may not, be a change for the better. I can only wish them good counsel, grounded on clear insight into what is best for them; and best success when they have resolved.</p>
<p>I have told Jean to get you twelve <hi rend="italic">ruled</hi> sheets of Paper at Dumfries, and send them out for my benefit: it appears to me, you need nothing but straight courses laid out for you to write as well as need be; you will be slower than some of us; but you can begin in time <pb id="pg-08-25" n="08:25"/>always, and fill your sheet independently of any of them. I have strictly charged Jean to look to the paper; so now it will depend on yourself.&#x2014; The Letter you sent was very gratifying and cheerful: I could fancy you all there, assembled in peace and goodwill, and see all the marketing, beef-salting and other winter-work going on; I sent off an account of it to Rome almost immediately, for I was in Jack&#x2019;s debt, he had got all my Letters, and I all his. We shall now perhaps go on in the Letter-and-Answer way for he has got somewhat nearer now, and a Letter can come and go in some five weeks, if it have fair play. Poor Jack, as you would see, is getting patients, and seems to be doing very well: I think we may henceforth reckon on the probability of better prosperity for him. I wish he were home again, and at length <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with his travels: you used to say he had &#x201C;another journey to make,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Uncertain.</note> but I hope it also will soon have been <hi rend="italic">made</hi>, and an anchorage of some sort found.</p>
<p>My own work here gets forward as well as it can. I am very anxious to be perfectly accurate (which I find to have been exceedingly neglected by my forerunners); the consequence of that is great searching and trouble; yet the thing when one is doing it ought to <hi rend="italic">be done</hi>. Hollow work always shows its hollowness one day or other: all men in all places at all times ought to <hi rend="italic">decline</hi> working hollow. As to the reception I shall meet with, there is no calculating, nor indeed does it give me almost any anxiety whatever. The people that judge of Books and men in these days are a wretched people, without wisdom, nay without sincerity which is the first chance for having wisdom; one is under the necessity of letting them babble out their foolish say, and heeding it no more than the cawing of rooks,&#x2014;in whose [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] sound guidance is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for man or woman. If I write anything that has meaning <supplied>[in]</supplied> it such meaning <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be lost. He that <hi rend="italic">gave</hi> me the meaning will care fitly for it. I wish, however, I were done with it! But I must stand to my tools first; there is no other way. The trees will be all leafy and the fields all <foreign><hi rend="italic">gowany</hi></foreign> [daisied] before I even see the end afar off: nevertheless thro&#x2019; it I will be, if life and strength are lent me. For the rest, dear Mother, be not concerned about my health suffering: I find it from day to day the <hi rend="italic">thriftiest</hi> way not to overwork myself; and really my health stands wonderfully well. You see I am at this very time giving myself a half-recreation of ten days. By the time you read this, I hope to be in full activity again.</p>
<p>The Bullers are come to live in London; Mrs Buller thinks <pb id="pg-08-26" n="08:26"/>Charles&#x2019;s health will fare better, were she here to look after it. She is almost fearfully bound up in Charles; and I think if he were to die, would almost die too: it is not safe to lean so on aught earthly. Charlie however is really a good fellow, and rising in his sphere of life; yet one cannot well prophecy much of him, he is so flighty, not in his purposes, but in his fits of application. He and his mother and the whole of them are radically given, to a very decided degree. That also is my humour, but I find little profit in speaking it out; <hi rend="italic">rebellion</hi>, against authority of any kind, is always a barren matter, full of irritancy, of poor painful feelings which are more of the Devil than of God. We are to dine with the Bullers tonight. I have not been in the Town these three days, but took my exercise in delving the garden, of which I have got a quarter put in order again. You will judge what a dry soil we have by my delving at this season. It is indeed and has been the finest winter I can remember; no snow at all, little rain, occasionally two days of black frost; and often quite a mild spring sky. We shall sit very <foreign><hi rend="italic">bield</hi></foreign> [sheltered] I suppose from the March winds; in summer again, for the same reason, we have far too little wind.&#x2014; When I think of Scotsbrig I rejoice much to fancy you snug and warm, with plenty of fire, and a drop ale, and so contented with what is allotted you. Alick&#x2019;s songs and Johnnie O&#x2019;Cox were pleasant to me, even at this distance: there is nothing one is more bound to be than cheerful for the bounty of the Giver; a little spell of singing is good and right; helps to &#x201C;haud one&#x2019;s heart aboon.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;There was a <foreign>lad</foreign>,&#x201D; st. 4.</note></p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon a son of Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hunt (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), the second son, had been difficult from childhood. He became an unsuccessful journalist and died in poverty. See <hi rend="italic">The Correspondence of Leigh Hunt</hi>, ed. Thornton Hunt (London, <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), 273&#x2013;75.</note> sent me a Letter to say that he was out of his Father&#x2019;s house, could not get back again, and wanted &#x201C;a few shillings,&#x201D; being in a &#x201C;starving&#x201D; state! We sent for him to come at <supplied>[and]</supplied> get some meat; shillings we could not give him. I find on talking with the poor Youth (about 22, strong and healthy) that he is very much what I had supposed: a creature grown up to manhood without the slightest nurture or admonition, with wild hungry wishes in <supplied>[him]</supplied>, with very considerable natural faculty, but without <hi rend="italic">any</hi> the faintest principle of conduct; whom accordingly (for what else could happen?) they have had to keep for the last 20 months or more up in a garret none of them speaking to him; from which state he is at last broken out&#x2014;into the street, and a &#x201C;starving state.&#x201D; I gave him numerous &#x201C;good advices&#x201D;; without much hope that <pb id="pg-08-27" n="08:27"/>he could (with all his wish to do it) profit much by them. &#x201C;Do you think, I should go into the <hi rend="italic">army</hi>, Sir?&#x201D; I had been telling Jane a few minutes before that I saw nothing under the Sun he could or should do but that. However, I counselled him to try <hi rend="italic">all</hi> other honest shifts first; in the meanwhile <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go back to his garret (from whence he would certainly have to break forth again) if there remained a resource for him on Earth: but above all to Know and lay deeply to heart that without quite a total change in his <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> man, and way of thinking and managing himself, <hi rend="italic">no</hi> thing whatsoever could or would go well with him. He stared on me with his keen black eyes, astonished, not unthankful looking; and went his way, with our &#x201C;best wishes,&#x201D; but not &#x201C;best hopes<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied>; and no pressing invitation to come back, for, as I calculate, one is better <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of all that folly, and could do no good <hi rend="italic">in</hi> it. Hunt is a fool surely (tho&#x2019; very clever too): but this is quite a common method of education here. The people have no wisdom, no religion, no principle of any kind; this is the result it leads to.</p>
<p>I must now end, my dear Mother: I will write again soon; a frank to yourself. Jean&#x2019;s Newspaper has just come with the two strokes on it, which I am thankful for, and try to believe. I hope you will confirm it soon by a <hi rend="italic">ruled</hi> sheet. Did you go to Annan? If your weather is as good as ours, you might take to Harry again. Jane&#x2019;s foot is quite well; she is now making up for her weeks of imprisonment. She is not here at this moment, and cannot charge me to send her love, which however you can reckon as certain. She has heard nothing from her Mother for some time, who is gone to Edinburgh: I insist that there is nothing wrong. Now write you soon, on a ruled sheet, and tell me that you are well, and all going well,&#x2014;if you can with truth. Let us be thankful that we have such a method of communicating, while separated: I hope we shall meet before very long. But my Book must be done first! Give my brotherly affection to every one of them. <closer><salute>God be with you, dear Mother!</salute></closer></p>

<p>As I find he is <hi rend="italic">totally</hi> without cash at this moment, I have promised that you will pay him five shillings in advance; I said too that the longer he could make this serve him, both you and I would think the more of him. The <hi rend="italic">rate</hi> he seems to say is &#x201C;a penny for 72 words&#x201D;; but he will be thankful for <hi rend="italic">any</hi> rate. It will perhaps be kindest to him that you do not pay him <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than what is strictly earned. As he has all the <hi rend="italic">virtues to acquire</hi>, the one most within his reach, and most important for him were probably <hi rend="italic">Thrift</hi>. How singular if this copying of your Manuscript should be the beginning of salvation for a living man! Alas, it is too dubious: <foreign><hi rend="italic">ich stehe f&#xfc;r Nichts</hi></foreign> [I cannot guarantee anything].</p>
<p>Do not forget Thursday Night, and the Education of the world.</p>

Hitherto unpbd. The manuscript is a neatly written draft with many corrections; but since these were all made in the course of composition and are not considered afterthoughts they are not given. Carlyle says in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<date when="1835-02-07">7 Feb.</date>): &#x201C;A few days ago I scribbled a kind of Prospectus of an <hi rend="italic">Educational Association</hi>, which I would fain see established, and work in here: Mill, whom alone I have consulted, thinks it would do were the Political hemisphere a little cleared. There already is such an Association at Glasgow; to which indeed I have written, half with a view of offering myself to it! They want a <hi rend="italic">Normal School</hi>, and mean to establish it, and go search in Germany and over England for insight towards that. I wrote as it were afar off; for <pb id="pg-08-30" n="08:30"/>I fancy it will be some Doctor-Chalmers concern, and I not the man for them. The London Scheme lies dormant; but I will show it to one or two.&#x201D; Again, in <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref>, he speaks of having written a &#x201C;manifesto&#x201D; about Educational Associations. It is likely that the subject had already been much discussed with Mill, and that in between writing to Mill on <date when="1835-02-02">2 Feb.</date> and seeing him on <date when="1835-02-05">5 Feb.</date> and discussing the &#x201C;Education of the world,&#x201D; Carlyle wrote this paper. It is also noteworthy that, on <date when="1835-01-29">29 Jan.</date> (see Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, III, 19) he saw Roebuck and Molesworth at the Bullers&#x2019;, both of whom (with Charles Buller) were on the Parliamentary select committee on Education: see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350601-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1835-06-01">1 June</date>]</ref>.<lb/><lb/>
As he explains, his proposals arose after writing a letter to the Glasgow Educational Association (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref>) and from a belief in national education shared with Mill, Buller and their radical associates: see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350601-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1835-06-01">1 June</date>]</ref>. What Carlyle had grasped was that the main obstacles to setting up a Metropolitan Normal School or training college came from sectarian dissension. He evidently saw that it was not practical politics for the government to be responsible; but that, just as the government&#x2019;s school building policy was simply to divide a grant between the Church National Society and the dissenting British and Foreign School Society, so he thought it might be encouraged to support an undenominational college if an independent association could be formed. Thus the paper&#x2019;s anti-sectarianism and its insistence on religious education are not only characteristic of Carlyle, but were a political necessity to cover as much common ground as possible. But the paper is specifically radical in social commentary and obviously unsympathetic to &#x201C;Church creeds.&#x201D; In the event the government was not ready to do anything, though there were vague statements about the need for colleges of education, and although Carlyle&#x2019;s plan might have been workable, it got no further than being shown privately to a few radical friends.<lb/><lb/>
So deeply convinced was Carlyle, that there are many parallels to note or discover between the present paper and his other works; but, though it also looks back to <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, the most important of these lie in <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> (<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>). At the same time, though consistent, there were two significant ways in which his arguments were to change. In the present paper (third paragraph) he suspends judgment on democracy; but, by the time he came to write the two later works, he had lost faith in the Reform Parliament or further extension of the suffrage. Nevertheless, he was to be all the more anxious for &#x201C;Universal Education&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Chartism, Works</hi>, XXIX, 192) and &#x201C;a right Education Bill&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi>, X, 265). The second change was to show in his loss of faith in its being carried out by anyone but the state. In the present paper he argues that &#x201C;the Government &#x2026; cannot undertake this task&#x201D; which must &#x201C;depend on <hi rend="italic">un</hi>official exertions&#x201D; (fourth paragraph). His disappointment was to result in insistence that national education could only be directed by an &#x201C;official person&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 197) or &#x201C;Education Secretary&#x201D; as part of an &#x201C;effective &#x2018;Teaching Service&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, X, 266). Such changes help to show how Carlyle&#x2019;s social and political creed partly grew out of experience and observation.<lb/><lb/>
In other ways, the development of his argument here is close to the way it was put forward later. Some likenesses lie in the way in which he sees that education is a necessity in a growing democracy and that, as &#x201C;the new time <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be born&#x201D; (third paragraph) so &#x201C;new eras do come&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 170). There are glances in both at the menace of disorder and Swing&#x2019;s rick-burning. In the present paper and <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> there is a parallel chain of argument that, though education is hindered by sectarianism it is fundamentally religious, yet that this does not mean &#x201C;plying with liturgies, catechisms and credos,&#x201D; but that just as &#x201C;the first thing needful &#x2026; is finding of a man who <hi rend="italic">has</hi> religion,&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 195&#x2013;96) so &#x201C;the grand requisite is a true-minded devout schoolmaster&#x201D; (ninth paragraph). Similarly, Carlyle&#x2019;s emphasis in this paper that Education should rest on recognition of &#x201C;the infinite nature of Duty&#x201D; (tenth paragraph), is like his insistence that it stands &#x201C;on the basis of everlasting duty&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 192). He consistently sees the denial of education as like denying light (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, X, 266), or leaving the uneducated blind (first paragraph), or with &#x201C;eyes still sealed&#x201D; or &#x201C;mutilated&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 192&#x2013;93). In the present paper he ends by asking if nothing is to be done. In <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, 199) he demands of leaders of Church and State what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be done.<lb/><lb/>
On the back of the last page, as folded, Carlyle wrote in a near-contemporary hand: &#x201C;National Education! (Whew!)&#x201D;</sourceNote><docBody>
<p><title><hi rend="small-caps">National Education</hi></title></p>
<p><title><hi rend="small-caps">[ca. 3 Feb. 1835]</hi></title></p>
<p>In some printed Books,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified and probably unidentifiable.</note> it is stated that the proportion of grown-up persons in England who can read and write is to those who cannot <pb id="pg-08-31" n="08:31"/>as One to Eleven.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the House of Lords, on <date when="1835-05-21">21 May</date>, Brougham was to say that only one child in twelve attended school: see Hansard, series 3, XXVII, col. 1303.</note> Supposing this statement, in our almost total want of statistic documents, to be greatly exaggerated,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Historians agree that exact figures are not ascertainable, but the estimate is an enormous exaggeration: see, for example, R. K. Webb, &#x201C;Working Class Readers in Early Victorian England,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">English Historical Review</hi>, 65 (<date when="1950-00-00">1950</date>), 333&#x2013;51, who thinks it probable that about three-quarters of the working-classes were literate rather than as few as two-thirds.</note> it is at any rate evident to all men that Education, in this country, both as to quantity and kind, is in the miserablest condition; that the educated even the ill-educated are comparatively few; and that thus, generation after generation, the great mass of the community grows up, and works out its existence, in a semi-barbarous state; shut out from participating in the common inheritance of mankind (for the Skill and Wisdom accumulated from the Past and existing in the Present is the sole possession of the Family of Man), as completely as the uncouched<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Uncouched&#x201D;: in the open air. Carlyle deleted &#x201C;man&#x201D; after &#x201C;blind.&#x201D;</note> blind is from the light of the sun at noonday ! If he know that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a sun shining, it is perhaps much: but to him it shines in vain, yielding no guidance: his sole guidance is <hi rend="italic">not to quit company</hi> with the other blind or half-seeing; and so grope darkly along, as his fathers have done,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; now on ways far different from those his fathers travelled on.</p>
<p>Such a state of matters, were we not used to see it daily, would fill us with sorrow and amazement. For each untaught individual it is a tragedy. <hi rend="italic">His</hi> life passes, and will not return, and he has never lived. To mutilate his body, to annihilate half the strength of his body, were small matter: but his soul has never opened her eyes; on him spiritual life never dawned, no faculty was unfolded but animal instincts, and some mechanic ingenuity as of beavers: he has issued from Eternity and returns to Eternity with a man&#x2019;s gifts in him, yet so like the beasts that perish!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Ps. 49:12.</note> Thus nevertheless it goes on for age <pb id="pg-08-32" n="08:32"/>after age; the millions that suffer it, hiding from us what a suffering it is for the individual units; and here and there a benevolent man lamenting it with a regret which he knows will bring no remedy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in this age of ours it has become far more pressing than ever. By the operation of causes, on which most considerate persons have been drawn to think, and form some theory or other, the millions of uneducated can no longer grope darkly along as their fathers did, but have now new and far rougher ways to travel. By Trades Unions, Political Unions, by all manner of blind convulsive movements (down even to the lowest desperate convulsive movements of Swing Rick-burning),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:52</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>. For trade union activities, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330213-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:326</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1833-02-13">13 Feb. 1833</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340530-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:197</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-30">30 May 1834</date></corr></ref>; for Swing, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310120-TC-MN-01"><sic>5:211</sic><corr>TC to MN, <date when="1831-01-20">20 Jan. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> we can discern that the matter is coming to a crisis with them. Their old guides and commanders (Clergy, Gentry and such like) are becoming distrusted; class after class of them is getting dismissed from the actual guideship; the popular mass feels more and more that it can trust only to its own guidance, that all other guidances mistake the griefs it labours under, or wilfully misinterpret them, and refuse any answer but coercion. The people have now established themselves as judges and scrutinising watchers over the conduct of all public affairs; and this not in show only and by complimentary appellation, but in substance and very deed; so that he henceforth who cannot (<hi rend="italic">acting</hi> rightly or wrongly) <hi rend="italic">convince the people of his being right</hi> will find it impossible to rule the people;&#x2014;which relation, indeed, has, in these late years, been translated into express law, and solemnly admitted as a fundamental principle of our Natural Existence, by the passing of the Reform Act. It certainly expresses the universal conviction, whether in hope or in fear, to say that the Democratic force in England which had long been increasing, has hence forth become irresistible, if still more or less modifiable; that while new results of all kinds are rapidly shaping themselves, it is the mass of the people mainly which will decide their shape; that with the mass of the people the whole destiny of all classes in England now lies. Whether such new results, inevitably fast approaching, shall be wise and beneficent, or unwise, false and ruinous, will depend simply on what wisdom is in the people, or what want of wisdom. To have such wisdom as exists universally imparted; in other words to have the people taught and well taught, is therefore at this moment the most important task of all. The new time <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be born: the just Thought or else the malignant <pb id="pg-08-33" n="08:33"/>Absurdity must and will embody itself into Reality, for great good, or for incalculable evil; there is no other alternative.</p>
<p>It may farther be stated, that according to all past experience, now less likely than ever to be belied, the Government of England cannot undertake this task: in their peculiar manner of existence, hampered amid conflicting parties, in endless Parliamentary and Extra-Parliamentary debatings, our Governments hitherto were seldom found to originate anything; nearly their whole energy is necessarily spent in keeping themselves in being. Unless England, by the energy of <hi rend="italic">un</hi>official exertions, can accomplish some scheme of National Education, it may for unlimited periods (one must fear), remain uneducated. On the other hand, <hi rend="italic">were</hi> such a scheme once matured in the community at large, or even loudly enough demanded by the community, doubtless an honest Government would thankfully sanction it, and set resolutely about executing it.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, is it not fit that the community bestir itself? That good men, of what political persuasion soever, in whose hands or in whose heads lie means of any kind, should cease <hi rend="italic">merely wishing</hi> in this matter, and begin acting? Let them resolve, with more emphasis than ever, that a task called for by God and man shall not longer remain uncommenced; that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> even now will commence it, and in all reasonable ways labour in it, and not rest from it till they see it in progress towards being <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. As the first step to which, ought they not to <hi rend="italic">unite</hi> their energies, since all strength is by union? Let them form a definite <hi rend="small-caps">association</hi> for this object, to act in it, speak in it, write in it, do towards it whatsoever their combined capabilities can. Already other such Associations are arising or about to arise (Glasgow, for one instance):<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref></note> but surely it would beseem the Metropolis to take the lead here; and in this as in so many other things to be the <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi>-city; the Mother of <hi rend="small-caps">educational associations</hi> in all towns of the Empire! Let us consider what the leading objects of such an Association might be; what difficulties it would probably have to contend with.</p>
<p>The grand primary object, inclusive of all others, were of course its own existence; that it might <hi rend="italic">be</hi> an Association, wherein men honestly united might strengthen one another&#x2019;s hands in this work, and do with incalculably increased effect whatsoever their collective sense and deliberation could devise; for, it has been said, &#x201C;ten men in fellowship will accomplish what a thousand isolated would attempt <pb id="pg-08-34" n="08:34"/>in vain.&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Aesop&#x2019;s Fables</hi>, &#x201C;The Bundle of Sticks,&#x201D; as ed. Rev. Thomas James (London, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), pp. 85&#x2013;86.</note> To awaken the whole people to this matter, by addressing them in written or spoken words, above all, in actions,&#x2014;which might speak; to collect information, statistic and scientific; to collect foreign experience, adjust it to domestic uses, and bring it home to the general conviction; to call out a far better Kind of Schoolmasters, and open freer field for them; in a word, by all rational methods to strive that Education should at once expand itself, and elevate itself: these were the aims of such an Association; to be endeavoured after in such way as its means might render possible and adviseable [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. Among the actions calculated to speak for themselves one of the hopefullest, might be the preparing and establishing of a Metropolitan Normal School, worthy of the Metropolis and the Kingdom; or preliminary arrangements for that.</p>
<p>The difficulties are indeed great; yet they are not unsurmountable. Wheresoever in the Earth there is one man wise and another man less wise, the former <hi rend="italic">can</hi> impart of his wisdom to the latter: Nature has in no way forbidden this, but in all ways emphatically prescribed it: nothing but some foolish misarrangement of Artifice<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS has &#x201C;Arrtifice.&#x201D;</note> has forbidden it. Even such imparting of spiritual strength to the less strong, such noble communing of Wisdom with Ignorance is all Education (if it be not mockery of Education);&#x2014;to which the mere arts of reading and writing, and indeed the most of what is yet communicated in our schools, are but the insignificant preludes, which only attain significance as they are followed by the performance. The word Knowing (or <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ken</hi>ning</foreign>) is in all good languages synonymous with <foreign><hi rend="italic">canning</hi></foreign>, or ability to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> somewhat.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Synonymous in Scots, at least; from Old English &#x201C;cennan,&#x201D; cognate with similar forms in Scandinavian and Teutonic languages.</note> This youth may profess himself trained to render Aeschylus into English words, and that only trained to make raw hides into leather boots; and it will depend on other circumstances, and a farther inquiry, whether the latter is not more <hi rend="italic">educated</hi> than the former.</p>
<p>One grand difficulty that used to stand on the very threshold may at last happily be considered as removed. It is not asserted by any reasonable person, in these days, that the poor should be kept ignorant in order to be governable by the rich: of that inhuman thesis (crueler than if we proposed to keep the poor always sickly that they might be governable) the world may consider itself delivered forever. The grand difficulty which still remains, on which all <pb id="pg-08-35" n="08:35"/>Educational Societies that hitherto exist among us have stumbled and lamed themselves, is that of Sectarianism in Religion. While Religion is Sectarian, the religious, so readily in all enterprises, divide themselves into uncommunicating, or even hostile Sects, from the angry jarring of which all men that were otherwise fittest are the eagerest to withdraw; whereby the active force is not only mournfully diminished in quantity, but rendered ineffective too by isolation into small portions. Nevertheless Religion is and will long continue Sectarian: it behoves all good men to look this difficulty calmly in the face, and consider well, whether from the sad condition of the highest Good the word Evil is to perpetuate itself yea, or no! Principle cannot and shall not be compromised; but if the Good hinders Good, let us be sure the fault is in us not in it.</p>
<p>Let us begin by admitting that this same Sectarian incompatibility is grounded on a truth, and even on the greatest truth. The teacher who does not thoroughly know that the culture of the character and heart not only transcends the culture of the understanding, but even includes it, and first makes it possible; or in hallowed words, that &#x201C;the fear of God is the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> of wisdom,&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 111:10.</note> knows nothing of his sacred art, and has no call to profess teaching. To train up the child<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 22:6.</note> in devout submission to the Laws whereby its unseen Author has appointed it to live; in a word, to make the child religious: this surely is the essence of Education, the spirit in which all true Education must be conducted. To have discerned this truth is much; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> to act upon it even contentiously is more honourable than to be at peace by failing to discern it. Unhappily, however, the next conclusion of the religious world tho&#x2019; a not unnatural is a most erroneous one: that this same spirit of Religion is to be infused into the hearts of children by the infusion into their memories, of certain Scientific Formulas (named Church Creeds) which better or worse represent it, symbolize it; each Formula (as is the nature of Science) standing more or less at war with all other Formulas; existing only as it can forbid them to exist. A sad state of matters; which ought not always to continue! Surely it might here become plain that Religion is not communicated by the memory or understanding, but by the heart; by the sacred contact of heart with heart; that to make true-minded devout scholars religious school-books are as dead leaves; the grand requisite is a true-minded devout schoolmaster: let <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a one be sought for as hid treasure, and welcomed and honoured when found; <pb id="pg-08-36" n="08:36"/>and in the finding of him let the religious problem be considered as solved. Scientific Formulas, if the Reality itself is there, may stand safely in abeyance: such Formulas are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Religion; but at most and best the <hi rend="italic">cases</hi> in which Religion lodges or has lodged,&#x2014;and may lodge again, for it is now <hi rend="italic">there</hi> to seek a lodgement.</p>
<p>A fit method of dealing with the religious difficulty might perhaps therefore ground itself on these two principles. First that no one to whom &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">infinite</hi> nature of Duty&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 162; it is a favorite expression, often repeated in Carlyle&#x2019;s writings after this.</note> had not disclosed itself; who did not regard religion as the highest; or, more specifically, who did not regard the Gospel of Jesus of Nazareth as verily an Evangel, or Message of glad news, the greatest ever sent from Heaven to Earth, and our Protestant form of reading this message as the glory of these late ages,&#x2014;should be invited to connect himself with our Association. Secondly that whosoever demanding for himself clear freedom to express this conviction, and harmonize it with his other knowledge, in what best (least inconceivable) way he could, demanded of his brother&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">freedom not</hi> to do the like, or to do the like at his peril,&#x2014;should, even as little, be invited to join us. In this way were tolerance perhaps reconciled with rigour, and the true men of our age mostly free to unite with us. Which one difficulty once overcome, no other were insuperable. There are properly but two Sects in the world: the Believing and the unbelieving; concerning which it was long ago written that Faith (Belief) would remove mountains.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. I Cor. 13:2, probably derived from Matt. 17:20 and 21:21.</note></p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p> 
<p>If these ideas are true, what is to be <hi rend="italic">done?</hi> Will he that reads them and believes them continue to answer: Nothing?</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir</salute>
<p>I owe you a speedy answer as well as a grateful one; for, in spite of the swift ships of the Americans, our communings pass too slowly. <pb id="pg-08-37" n="08:37"/>Your Letter, written in November,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1834-11-20">20 Nov.</date></note> did not reach me till a few days ago; your Books or Papers have not yet come,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;I found three greedy receivers of Teufelsdroch, who also radiate its light.

And since you study French History, do not fail to look at our Yankee portrait of Lafayette.&#x201D; Slater (pp. 110&#x2013;11) identifies the other two &#x201C;greedy receivers&#x201D; of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> as Mrs. Samuel Ripley, Emerson&#x2019;s aunt by marriage, and Lydia Jackson, who soon became Emerson&#x2019;s second wife. He further states that Hedge, who had written a very favorable review of Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Examiner</hi> for <date when="1834-07-00">July 1834</date>, had contributed his articles on Swedenborg and Phrenology, treating both subjects sceptically, to the same journal (<date when="1833-11-00">Nov. 1833</date>, pp. 193&#x2013;218; and <date when="1834-11-00">Nov. 1834</date>, pp. 249&#x2013;69), and that the &#x201C;Yankee portrait of Lafayette&#x201D; was probably the <hi rend="italic">Eulogy on Lafayette, Delivered in Faneuil Hall &#x2026; <date when="1834-09-06">September 6, 1834</date>,</hi> by Edward Everett (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), American orator, statesman, and Unitarian clergyman.

He showed me his <hi rend="italic">waybill</hi> or invoice, and the consignment of these friendly effects &#x201C;to another gentleman,&#x201D; and undertook with an air of great fidelity to bring all to a right bearing. On the whole, as the Atlantic is so broad and deep, ought we not rather to esteem it a beneficent miracle that messages can arrive at all; that a little ship of paper will skim over all these weltering floods, and other inextricable confusions; and come at last, in the hand of the Twopenny Postman, safe to your lurking-place, like green leaf in the bill of Noah&#x2019;s Dove?

<p>The date of your Letter gives me unhappily no idea but that of Space and Time. As you know my Whereabout, will you throw a little light on your own. I can imagine Boston, and have often seen the musket vollies on Bunker Hill;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first severe engagement of the Revolutionary War, <date when="1775-06-17">17 June 1775</date>.</note> but in this new spot there is nothing for me save sky and earth, the chance of retirement, peace and winter seclusion. Alas, I can too well fancy one other thing: the bereavement you allude to, the sorrow that will so long be painful before it can become merely sad and sacred. Brothers, especially <pb id="pg-08-38" n="08:38"/>in these days, are much to us: had one no Brother, one could hardly understand what it was to have a Friend; they are the Friends whom Nature chose for us; Society and Fortune, as things now go, are scarcely compatible with Friendship, and contrive to get along, miserably enough, without it. Yet sorrow not above measure for him that is gone. He is, in very deed and truth, with God,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">where</hi> you and I both are. What a thin film it is that divides the Living from the Dead! In still nights, as Jean Paul says, &#x201C;the limbs of my Buried Ones touched cold on my soul, and drove away its blots, as dead hands heal eruptions of the skin.&#x201D;&#x2014; Let us turn back into Life.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written about his younger brother, Edward Bliss (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>), who had died of tuberculosis on <date when="1834-10-01">1 Oct.</date> Carlyle quotes from his translation of Richter&#x2019;s &#x201C;Life of Quintus Fixlein,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXII, 331; his journal (Froude, III, 20) shows he was thinking of his sister Margaret. Emerson showed by an entry in his journal that he disliked this quotation and Richter&#x2019;s &#x201C;bad taste&#x201D; in general. See Slater, p. 113.</note></p>
<p>That you sit there bethinking yourself, and have yet taken no course of activity, and can without inward or outward hurt so sit, is on the whole rather pleasing news to me. It is a great truth which you say that Providence can well afford to have one sit:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;possessing my liberty, I am determined to keep it at the risk of uselessness, (which risk God can very well abide).&#x201D; Slater, p. 109.</note> another great truth which you feel without saying it is that a course wherein clear faith cannot go with you may be worse than none; if clear faith go never so slightly against it, then it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> certainly worse than none. To speak with perhaps ill-bred candour, I like as well to fancy you <hi rend="italic">not</hi> preaching to Unitarians, a Gospel after their heart. I will say farther that you are the only man I ever met with of that persuasion whom I could unobstructedly like.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had resigned from the Unitarian Ministry, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, yet in spite of doubts his sympathy still lay with that faith, as Carlyle had learned when they talked together at Craigenputtoch in <date when="1833-08-00">August 1833</date>.</note> The others that I have seen were all a kind of halfway-house characters, who, I thought, should, if they had not wanted courage, have ended in unbelief; in &#x201C;faint possible Theism,&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;State of German Literature,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXVI, 82.</note> which I like considerably worse than Atheism. Such, I could not but feel, deserve the fate they find here; the bat-fate: to be killed among the rats as a bird, among the birds as a rat. I know your Channing a little; I have met with our Fox;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For W. E. Channing and W. J. Fox, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321016-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:240</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-10-16">16 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>. Both were Unitarians.</note> but find my opinion only confirmed by these. You can pardon me this heresy? Nay who knows but it is doubts of the like kind in your own mind that keep <pb id="pg-08-39" n="08:39"/>you for a time inactive even now? For the rest, that you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> liberty to choose by your own will merely, is a great blessing; too rare for those that could use it so well; nay often it is difficult to use. But till <hi rend="italic">ill health</hi> of body or of mind warns you that the moving not the sitting posture is essential, <hi rend="italic">sit</hi> still, contented in conscience; understanding well that no man, that God only knows <hi rend="italic">what</hi> we are working, and will show it one day; that such and such a one, who filled the whole Earth with his hammering and trowelling and would not let men pass for his rubbish, turns out to have built of mere coagulated froth, and vanishes with his edifice, traceless, silently or amid hootings illimitable; while again that other still man, by the word of his mouth, by the very look of his face, was scattering influences, as <hi rend="italic">seeds</hi> are scattered&#x2014;&#x201C;to be found flourishing as a banyan-grove after a thousand years.&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor,</hi> p. 40.</note> I beg your pardon for all this preaching, if it be superfluous: impute it to no miserable motive.</p>
<p>Your objections to Goethe are very natural, and even bring you nearer me:<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;Far far better seems to me the unpopularity of this Philosophical Poem [<hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>] (shall I call it?) than the adulation that followed your eminent friend Goethe. With him I am becoming better acquainted, but mine must be a qualified admiration. It is a singular piece of good nature in you to apotheosize him. I cannot but regard it as his misfortune with conspicuous bad influence on his genius,&#x2014;that velvet life he led. What incongruity for genius whose fit ornaments &#x26; reliefs are poverty &#x26; hatred, to repose fifty years in chairs of state. &#x2026; Then the Puritan in me accepts no apology for bad morals in such as <hi rend="italic">he</hi>.&#x201D; Slater, p. 107.</note> nevertheless I am by no means sure that it were not your wisdom, at this moment, to set about learning the German Language with a view towards studying <hi rend="italic">him</hi> mainly! I do not assert this; but the truth of it would not surprise me. Believe me, it is impossible you can be more a Puritan than I; nay I often feel as if I were far too much so: but John Knox himself could he have seen the peaceable impregnable <hi rend="italic">fidelity</hi> of that man&#x2019;s mind, and how to him also Duty was <hi rend="italic">infinite,</hi> Knox would have passed on, wondering, not reproaching. But I will tell you in a word why I like Goethe: his is the only <hi rend="italic">healthy</hi> mind, of any extent, that I have discovered in Europe for long generations; it was he that first convincingly proclaimed to me (convincingly, for I saw it <hi rend="italic">done</hi>): Behold even in this scandalous Sceptico-Epicurean generation, when all is gone but Hunger and Cant, it is still possible that Man be a Man! For which last Evangel, the confirmation and rehabilitation of all other Evangels whatsoever, how can I be too grateful? On the whole, I suspect you yet know <pb id="pg-08-40" n="08:40"/>only Goethe the Heathen (Ethnic); but you will know Goethe the Christian by and by, and like that one far better. Rich showed me a Compilation in green cloth boards that you had beckoned across the water: pray read the fourth volume of that, and let a man of your clearness of feeling say, whether that was a Parasite or a Prophet.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers here to his <hi rend="italic">German Romance,</hi> (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), of which vol. IV was his translation of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi>.</note>&#x2014; And then as to &#x201C;misery&#x201D; and the other dark ground on which you love to see genius paint itself,&#x2014;alas, consider whether misery is not <hi rend="italic">ill health</hi> too; also whether good fortune is not worse to bear than bad; and on the whole whether the glorious serene Summer is not greater than the wildest hurricane,&#x2014;as Light, the Naturalists say, is stronger a thousand times than Lightning. And so I appeal to Philip sober;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Slater points out that nine years later in his essay &#x201C;New England Reformers&#x201D; Emerson made full use of the &#x201C;Philip sober&#x201D; anecdote: &#x201C;You remember the story of the poor woman who importuned King Philip of Macedon to grant her justice, which Philip refused: the woman exclaimed, &#x2018;I appeal&#x2019;: the king, astonished, asked to whom she appealed: the woman replied, &#x2018;From Philip drunk to Philip sober,&#x2019;&#x201D; and that the classical source is Valerius Maximus, VI, 2.</note>&#x2014;and indeed have hardly said as much about Goethe since I saw you, for nothing reigns here but twilight delusion (falser for the time than midnight darkness) on that subject, and I feel that the most suffer nothing thereby, having properly nothing or little to do with such a matter: but with you, who are not &#x201C;seeking recipes for happiness,&#x201D; but something far higher, it is not so, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> I have spoken and appealed; and hope the new curiosity, if I have awakened any, will do you no mischief.</p>
<p>But now as to myself; for you will grumble at a sheet of speculation sent so far: I am here still, as Rob Roy was on Glasgow Bridge, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">byding tryste</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [waiting for a meeting]<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Rob Roy,</hi> ch. 21.</note>; busy extremely with work that will not profit me at all in some senses; suffering rather in health and nerves; and still with nothing like dawn on any quarter of my horizon. The <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> has not been printed, but will be, were this <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi><note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Diamond Necklace&#x201D; was published in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> XV, (<date when="1837-01-00">Jan.</date> and <date when="1837-02-00">Feb. 1837</date>); <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> about <date when="1837-05-09">9 May, 1837</date>.</note> out; which latter, however, drags itself along in a way that would fill your benevolent heart with pity. I am for three small volumes now, and have one done. It is the dreadfullest labour (with these nerves, this liver) I ever undertook; all is so inaccurate, superficial, vague, in the numberless Books I consult; and without accuracy at least, what other good is possible? Add to this that I have no hope about the thing, except only that I <hi rend="italic">shall be done</hi> <pb id="pg-08-41" n="08:41"/><hi rend="italic">with it:</hi> I can reasonably expect nothing from any considerable class here, but at <hi rend="italic">best</hi> to be scolded and reproached; perhaps to be left standing &#x201C;on my own basis,&#x201D;<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A favorite expression of Carlyle&#x2019;s.</note> without note or comment of any kind,&#x2014;save from the Bookseller, who will lose his printing. The hope I have however is sure: if life is lent me; I shall be <hi rend="italic">done with</hi> the business; I will write this &#x201C;History of Sansculottism,&#x201D; the notablest phenomenon I meet with since the time of the Crusades or earlier; after which my part in it is played. As for the future, I heed it little when so busy; but it often seems to me, as if one thing were becoming indisputable: that I must seek another craft than Literature for these years that may remain to me. Surely, I often say, if ever man had a finger-of-Providence shown him, thou hast it; Literature will neither yield thee bread, nor a stomach to digest bread with: quit it in God&#x2019;s name, shouldst thou take spade and mattock instead. The truth is, I believe Literature to be as good as dead and gone in all parts of Europe at this moment, and nothing but hungry Revolt and Radicalism appointed us for perhaps three generations; I do not see how a man can honestly live by writing, in another dialect than that, in England at least; so that if you determine on not living dishonestly, it will behove you to look several things full in the face, and ascertain what is what with some distinctness. I suffer also terribly from the solitary existence I have all along had; it is becoming a kind of passion with me, to feel myself among my brothers. And then, How? Alas, I care not a doit for Radicalism, nay I feel it to be a wretched necessity, unfit for me; Conservatism being not unfit only but false for me: yet these two are the grand Categories under which all English spiritual activity that so much as thinks remuneration possible must range itself. I look around accordingly on a most wonderful vortex of things; and pray to God only that as my day is so my strength may be.<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Deut. 33:25.</note> What will come out of it is wholly uncertain: for I have possibilities too; the possibilities of London are far from exhausted yet: I have a brave Brother, who invites me to come and be quiet with him in Rome; a brave friend (known to you) who opens the door of a new western world,&#x2014;and so we will stand considering and consulting, at least till the Book be over. Are all these things interesting to you? I know they are.</p>
<p>As for America and Lecturing, it is a thing I do sometimes turn over, but never yet with any seriousness. What your friend says of the <pb id="pg-08-42" n="08:42"/>people being more persuadable, so far as having no Title-controversy &#x26;c &#x26;c will go, I can most readily understand it.<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An unidentified &#x201C;friend of mine &#x26; of yours&#x201D; who had said of Americans, when Emerson had said that he wished Carlyle would visit them, that they were not so set in their opinions. Slater, p. 110.</note> But apart from that, I should rather fancy America mainly a new Commercial England, with a fuller pantry: little more or little less. The same unquenchable, almost frightfully unresting spirit of endeavour, directed (woe is me!) to the making of money, or money&#x2019;s work, namely food finer and finer, and gigmanic renown higher and higher: nay must not your gigmanity be a <hi rend="italic">purse</hi>-gigmanity, some half-shade worse than a purse-and-pedigree one? Or perhaps it is not a whit worse; only rougher, more substantial; on the whole better? At all events ours is fast becoming identical with it; for the pedigree ingredient is as near as may be gone: <foreign><hi rend="italic">gagnez de l&#x2019;argent, et ne vous faites pas pendre</hi></foreign> [make money and don&#x2019;t get yourself hanged], this is very nearly the whole Law, first Table and Second. So that you see when I set foot on American land, it will be on no Utopia; but on a <hi rend="italic">Conditional</hi> piece of ground, where some things are to be expected and other things not.&#x2014;&#x2014; I may say, on the other hand, that Lecturing (or I would rather it were <hi rend="italic">Speaking</hi>) is a thing I have always had some hankering after: it seems to me I could really <hi rend="italic">Swim</hi> in that element, were I once thrown into it; that in fact it would develope [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] several things in me, which struggle violently for developement [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. The great want I have towards such an enterprise is one you may guess at: want of a <hi rend="italic">rubric,</hi> of a title to name my speech by. Could any one but appoint me Lecturing Professor of Teufelsdrockh&#x2019;s science: &#x201C;Things in general&#x201D;! The discourse of Poets and Poetry in the Hazlitt style, or talk stuff about the Spirit of the Age, were most unedifying: one knows not what to call himself. However, there is no doubt that were the child born it <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be christened: wherefore I will really request you to take the business into your consideration, and give me in the most rigorous sober manner you can some scheme of it: How <hi rend="italic">many</hi> Discourses; what Towns; the probable Expenses, the probable net Income, the Time &#x26;c &#x26;c, all that you can suppose a man wholly ignorant might want to know about it. America I should like well enough to visit; much as I should another part of my native country: it is as you see distinctly possible that such a thing might be; we will keep it hanging, to solace ourselves with it, till the time decide.</p>
<p>Have I involved you in double postage by this loquacity? Or <pb id="pg-08-43" n="08:43"/>what is your Am<supplied>[er]</supplied>ican rule? I did not intend it when I began; but today my Confusion of head is very <supplied>[gr]</supplied>eat, and words must be multiplied with only a given quantity of meaning.</p>
<p>My Wife, who is just gone out to spend the day with a certain &#x201C;celebrated Mrs Austin&#x201D; (called also the &#x201C;celebrated Translatress of Puckler Muskau&#x201D;<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prince Hermann von P&#xfc;ckler-Muskau (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>) <hi rend="italic">Briefe eines Verstor-benen</hi> &#x2026; (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), translated as <hi rend="italic">Tour in England, Ireland, and France</hi> &#x2026; (London, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>) by Sarah Austin.</note>), charged me very specially to send you her love, her good wishes and thanks: I assure you there is no hypocricy [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in that. She votes often for taking the Transatlantic scheme into contemplation; declares farther that my Book and Books must and will indisputably prosper (at some future era), and takes the world beside me,&#x2014;as a good wife and daughter of John Knox should.&#x2014; Speaking of &#x201C;celebrated&#x201D; persons here, let me mention that I have learned by stern experience, as children do with fire, to keep in general quite out of the way of celebrated persons, more especially celebrated women. This Mrs Austin who is half ruined by celebrity (of a kind) is the only woman I have seen not wholly ruined by it. Men, strong men I have seen die of it; or go mad by it.<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is probably thinking of Edward Irving.</note> <hi rend="italic">Good</hi> fortune is far worse than bad!&#x2014;&#x2014; Will you write with all despatch my dear Sir; fancy me a fellow wayfarer, who cordially bids you God-Speed, and would fain keep in sight of you, within sound of you.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours with great sincerity,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Hunt will be at you tomorrow, or at farthest on Saturday; hungry as a hyaena. To cut off from him the very temptation to play false, I beforehand furnish you with the enclosed receipt; testifying visibly that he has already (with your 5) eaten twenty shillings of his wages. His work, what part of it I have seen, seems very tolerably done; nor have I, of my own insight, anything (except that crime of hunger) <pb id="pg-08-44" n="08:44"/>to urge against him. He has not even intruded himself on me, unless when driven by necessity, stronger than an armed man.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 24:34.</note> Poor devil! And yet one can do nothing for him, so good as leave him almost if not altogether alone. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wer nicht spannt dem kann man nicht vorspannen</hi></foreign>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The man who doesn&#x2019;t try, cannot.&#x201D;</note> is one of the truest proverbs in the world.</p>
<p>These five or six times I have forgotten to answer you in words, what seemed hardly worth writing, that with regard to that wretched <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi>, Fraser did already all but as good as refuse it for his Cesspool of a Magazine: so there again we have a <foreign><hi rend="italic">finis</hi></foreign>.

Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica,</hi> I. 139.</note>&#x2014; You have a right to know this; that I may not seem disobliging when it is so little my part to be it.</p>
<p>Remember that properly speaking I did not see you last time!&#x2014; I am writing at the <hi rend="italic">F&#xEA;te des Piques</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Feast of Pikes,&#x201D; title of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution,</hi> Vol. II, Bk. 1; about the patriotic ceremony in the Champs de Mars, <date when="1790-07-14">14 July 1790</date>, the anniversary of Bastille Day.

Having resolved to be <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> with it, why should I halt for more fatigue? &#x2026; Soul and body both very <hi rend="italic">sick;</hi> yet I have a kind of sacred defiance.&#x201D;</note> the most confused of mortals.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I regret you should have heard at all of poor John&#x2019;s having ever applied to me:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350129-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1835-01-29">29 Jan.</date></ref></note> nothing else but the hope you might <hi rend="italic">not</hi> hear could have excused me for not apprising you instantly. Nevertheless be of comfort; all I do trust may still be well. Let this line meanwhile assure you that the poor boy has spoken no word, given no faintest hint to prejudice me against you, which indeed no hint or word of his (or I think of anybody&#x2019;s) could have done; he seems to me to love you as a son should; to be in short a wild untamed creature with considerable stuff in him,&#x2014;whom the world will tame. So much suffice <pb id="pg-08-45" n="08:45"/>at present. Tonight I fear I shall be engaged; but if not, I will certainly step over to you: at all events, tomorrow. Pray explain nothing to me that you feel it painful to speak of. I have trust enough in you; and, I may say, no <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>trust at all.</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>&#x201C;Twopenny&#x201D; gave his two knocks at the door today; and Jane came dancing up, holding in her hand a Letter, which I knew by her air to be yours.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A long letter dated <date when="1835-02-03">3 Feb.</date></note> We sat down, as usual, and read it together. It seems to have come within the fortnight; and as tomorrow is postday, I answer you instantly; so that this, you may observe, is a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> of interval. I could not do out my forenoon&#x2019;s task of writing, but wended Townwards thro&#x2019; innumerable turnings as far as Park Crescent (Portland Place, to see the Bullers, whom however I found removed); we have had rather an influx of visitors since that; and finally Coffee, and see now the night our own, all quiet round us except the melancholy <hi rend="italic">yowling</hi> of one poor shrimp-vender: wherefore, on this good sheet, all manner of small intelligence can be deliberately sent. Small intelligence, wholly of a comfortable kind; or the comfortable assurance that there is none.</p>
<p>Since I wrote last nothing unhandsome has passed here. I think I have had no direct Letter from Dumfriesshire (for did not my Mother&#x2019;s Letter come just when I was writing?); but Jean&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> has come duly with the two typical strokes on the back of it; indeed, I myself was just thinking of writing; and I will do it now along with your Letter: but I reasonably flatter myself there is nothing materially altered. Alick&#x2019;s Farm indeed I see advertised in the Newspaper to be let <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>, and with an express notification that &#x201C;the present tenant&#x201D; has no purpose whatever of offering for it:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> of <date when="1835-02-04">4</date> and <date when="1835-02-11">11 Feb.</date>, as a farm of 217 acres in Dryfesdale Parish, the lease to be offered on <date when="1835-02-17">17 Feb.</date></note> so doubtless the little shifty fellow will be in at Dumfries tomorrow, and find himself on new ground at night. Whether one should regret it or rejoice at <pb id="pg-08-46" n="08:46"/>it is uncertain to me here: nothing could be muddier and more hopeless of improvement than his position there; he has ingenuity for managing a far better concern, perhaps even for creating a better on free ground: he calculated on one great improvement as certain, that of <hi rend="italic">not needing servants,</hi> which there (as it does everywhere in this certainly dissolving society of ours) filled him with perpetual dissatisfaction. Farming as [is] at as low an ebb now as one could fancy, and small seems the hope of its bettering: prices are dust-low; the Corn-bill itself ruined by importation from Ireland, by the inability of all to eat aught save potatoes!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date> the Corn Laws had set the price of corn at 73s, below which foreign corn could not be imported without a heavy duty. But after four years of good harvest the average price a quarter of home grown corn in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> was: wheat 39s 4d, barley 29s 11d, and oats 22s. Irish imports were evidently believed to keep the price low.</note> And then the Landlords themselves indebted up to the lips! Tillage of the soil is no craft here; it is something only in the Savannahs of the West. I will write to poor Dillick (<hi rend="italic">Dilke,</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dillick&#x201D; is presumably a family term for brother Alick. Then seeing it written down, Carlyle tries spelling the name another way like that of C. W. Dilke (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), editor of the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>.</note> think you?) by the frank, and speak an encouraging word to him. Your Letter would give him true joy; for he is a most affectionate creature; &#x201C;as <foreign>het</foreign> as ginger and as <foreign>stieve</foreign> as steel.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321119-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:259</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-11-19">19 Nov. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>To me, dear Jack, your Letters as signs of the great blessing I have in yourself, are always blessings. You seem to have got upon a true adamant basis at last, and as the effervescence of such blessed novelty (a being-born again, out of Darkness into marvellous Light) gradually subsides, you will see your course <foreign><hi rend="italic">ernst und sch&#xF6;n</hi></foreign> [seriously and well], and pursue it in true manhood (almost a miracle in this era!); not without overcloudings and transient bewilderments (for showers and sloughs are on every path); but <hi rend="italic">never,</hi> I can prophecy, with more than transient ones. The sun is but hidden, not extinguished to one. Bless God for it, in the depths of your soul; and, for the rest, do not even <hi rend="italic">think</hi> more about it than you can conveniently help. &#x201C;The End of man is an Action not a Thought:&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor,</hi> pp. 155 n., 196.</note> it is a pity that one even needed <hi rend="italic">Conversion</hi> (as all men do in these Heathen days), it leads to so much self-consciousness, which is always barren, oftenest diseased and productive of disease. In your way of thought, however, I discern such a <hi rend="italic">joyfulness</hi> in the midst of deepest seriousness as reassures me against all apprehension: you <hi rend="italic">seize</hi> hold of the Real with <pb id="pg-08-47" n="08:47"/>right heart, and work with most frank abandonment; that is all as it should be. One is brother of all the world (for God made it all), and yet above the world: there is but that way of getting on with it. Do you ever &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">laugh</hi> from head to heel&#x201D; with your Prussian<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written about Dr. Brunn, a German medical friend of his, from Coethen, whom he had known in Vienna and who was in Rome for his health: &#x201C;We have the longest walks together, armed with two strong sticks to defend ourselves from the shepherds dogs on the Campagna, that sometimes w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bite if left to themselves unawed. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> B. is a sort of <foreign><hi rend="italic">sch&#xF6;ne Seele</hi></foreign> [radiant spirit] of the male sex, not possessed of much information in regard to any thing but his own profession with which he is extremely well acquainted. He has a degree of simplicity &#x26; straig<supplied>[ht]</supplied> forwardness and resoluteness such as I have not seen combined. We talk the strange<supplied>[st]</supplied> talk about all things and some others [cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270604-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:227</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1827-06-04">4 June 1827</date></corr></ref>], never wrangle or debate by any chance, but only compare, and expand or illustrate. I find myself better for my walks with him.&#x201D; John also mentions his friendship with Christian Karl Josias Bunsen (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), then the Prussian minister to the Vatican.</note> or any other friend? I fear, not yet; but that too is coming, for the soul of Doilter is full of <hi rend="italic">ludicrosity,</hi> neither is anything more genial than wise laughter; that is <hi rend="italic">great</hi> laughter; &#x1F05;&#x03C2;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x03B3;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;&#x2014;fit for the gods.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x03AC;&#x03C2;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x03B3;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;, &#x201C;unquenched (i.e., irrepressible) laughter,&#x201D; Homer, <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>, I, 599, <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>, VIII, 326.</note>&#x2014; I like well to see you and Brunn walking in the Campagna, in this spring weather, with your long sticks to scare the shepherds&#x2019; curs, fiercer seemingly than ours, for I have seen a Scottish one frightened thro several streets by the mere attitude and voice of a Mr Greatheart:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Bunyan, <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress, The Second Part</hi> (London, <date when="1684-00-00">1684</date>).</note> did you? I send my love to good Brunn, or rather to your picture of him, for unhappily I can see nothing more. Such a companion, denied to the most, is a treasure: I have enjoyed it with Edward Irving, but not before or since.&#x2014; Your position in regard to Lady Clare&#x2019;s illness has evidently been one of very great delicacy, and I wholly congratulate you on managing it so honestly, and that it has ended so well. Homoepathy [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] is certainly as mad as most things; yet there are many Wigrams.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written that Lady Clare&#x2019;s &#x201C;best friends did all they could to advise her to try <hi rend="italic">Homeopathy</hi> about which there is a fashionable gabbling at present, in Rome perhaps more than elsewhere. Miss Elliot and Mr Wigram set upon me to advise her also which I would not undertake to do on any consideration. I told them that I had been waiting for seven years to see a case that had been bettered by it, and had seen very many treated altogether in vain; and that it seemed to me theoretically as well as practically extremely absurd. Lady Clare might try it if she felt any faith in its efficacy, but I had no faith to give her &#x26; would have nothing to do with any regularly educated physician that would pretend he had.&#x201D;</note> We have a Homoepathic [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Doctor here (name forgotten), who is working wonders, and riding prosperously: he had been treating Austin &#x201C;with most <hi rend="italic">marked</hi> <pb id="pg-08-48" n="08:48"/>success&#x201D;; I believe I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> altogether keep my gravity as Mrs A. was expatiating on him. Quack surely!&#x2014;or something more, for that derives itself only from <hi rend="italic">quick</hi>-silver and Paracelsus,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paracelsus (<date when="1493-00-00">1493</date>&#x2013;<date when="1541-00-00">1541</date>), physician and alchemist, based his medicine on the observation of nature and rejected the medieval academic tradition. As town physician in Basel, about <date when="1526-00-00">1526</date>&#x2013;<date when="1528-00-00">28</date>, his lectures resulted in his expulsion by orthodox medical scholars, and he resumed his wandering life.</note>&#x2014;not surely such a chimera as this. If &#x201C;infinitely small doses&#x201D; were so influential, I remarked that day, then what a Panacea must <hi rend="italic">London Fog</hi> be, containing infinitely small doses of almost all substances in the terrestial Planet! Such an Alcahest should swallow Cullen&#x2019;s Nosology, and let us have done with it.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Alcahest,&#x201D; the universal solvent sought by alchemists, and a word thought to have been coined by Paracelsus (used by Carlyle in &#x201C;Corn-Law Rhymes,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXVIII, 150); William Cullen (<date when="1710-00-00">1710</date>&#x2013;<date when="1790-00-00">90</date>), <hi rend="italic">Synopsis Nosologiae Methodicae</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>), which is a systematic classification of diseases.</note> O Jack, what unspeakable <foreign><hi rend="italic">gomerals</hi></foreign> [fools] are the children of men!

<p>As to myself, I have been thinking more than once that I gave you too acrid a picture of my situation last time, that I need not have troubled you with so exclusive a <hi rend="italic">night</hi>-side of the business. However, it assures you of my sincerity. On the whole I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> unhappy. Three fourths (perhaps far more) of all my sufferings proceed, literally as I find from ill health of body. This is a sure fact. After finishing the thing I was at when writing to you, I took a three weeks of almost exclusive reading: the world grew quite sunny to me! I began writing again; my happiness my feeling of strength was great for three or four days, and now it begins abating again, let me work never so moderately. You need not fear my excess of exertion: it is absolutely a saving from day to day, to go on moderately. Let me try it tonight after dinner, tomorrow I am lamed, my fine morning is lost. Under these circumstances, I mean to finish out this Book; and then, by God&#x2019;s blessing, try more earnestly than ever to get my poor clay case refitted a little. There was no Heaven&#x2019;s fiat that I should be forever sick. Wisdom lies not in perpetual sickness; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> clearly is <hi rend="italic">un</hi>wise. The honest task, which I thank God is henceforth not so obscure to me <pb id="pg-08-49" n="08:49"/>I will study to do: the talent which God has given me shall not rust unused; but must Booksellers, Able Editors, and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Glar</hi></foreign> [Mud] Company of such like individuals be a new set of <hi rend="italic">middlemen</hi> between me and my task? <hi rend="italic">Health</hi> dwelt with the wise men of old; one can find it still, and live, one would think? In short, I positively do not care that Periodical Literature shuts her fist against me in these months: let her keep it shut forever (I say often), and go to the Devil, whom she mostly belongs to, not I! The matter had <hi rend="italic">better</hi> be brought to a crisis. There is perhaps a finger of Providence in it: I have now for three and twenty months, hard working, earned no penny by that craft; yet all men seem to admit that I am as able as ever, I have been as willing; I know not even in what I have offended any rule of prudence in it. The secret <hi rend="italic">is</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the whole matter is Froth, and grounds itself on Novelty, Bubbles, and unreality; the inference seems, walk out of it then,&#x2014;if even into knapping of stones, which is a Reality. We will do nothing rashly, but have our eyes open, and study to do all things fitly.&#x2014; My only new scheme, since last Letter, is a <hi rend="italic">Hypothesis</hi> (little more yet) about National Education. The Newspaper had an Advertisement about a &#x201C;Glasgow [&#x2018;National&#x2019;&#x2014;crossed over] Educational Association,&#x201D;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Glasgow Educational Society or Association, revived in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Scottish Guardian</hi> (<date when="1835-01-27">27 Jan.</date>), the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> (<date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan.</date>) for a headmaster for the projected Teachers&#x2019; Training College or Normal School. They wanted &#x201C;a Gentleman of liberal Education, decided Christian character, and a member of the established Church of Scotland&#x2014;who is willing to spend a year or more, at the expense of the Society, in visiting the best schools of England and Germany, acquainting himself in particular with the Normal Seminaries of Prussia. &#x2026; A person about thirty years of age would be preferred&#x2014;of matured and cultivated mind&#x2014;acquainted with the recent improvements in the theory and art of Education.&#x201D; They aimed to engraft on &#x201C;the Scriptural and Protestant principles of the venerable Parochial Schools&#x201D; of Scotland, whatever was best in the countries to be visited. John McCrie, son of Thomas McCrie (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210300-TC-MAC-01"><sic>1:335</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1821-03-01">1 March 1821</date></corr></ref>), was appointed, duly went on the tour, and died nine months later. The first headmaster of the college, opened in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, was Rev. Robert Cunningham.</note> which wants a man that would found a Normal School, first going over England and into Germany to get light on that matter. I wrote to that Glasgow Association; afar off, inquiring who they were, what manner of man they expected; testifying myself very friendly to their project and so forth. No answer as yet. It is likely they will want, as Jane says, a Chalmers-and-Welsh<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Rev. Thomas Chalmers (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), professor of divinity at Edinburgh, and Professor David Welsh (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), professor of church history at Edinburgh, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270913-JWC-JAC-01"><sic>4:260</sic><corr>JWC to JAC, <date when="1827-09-13">13 Sept. 1827</date></corr></ref>.

Perhaps my name is so heterodox in that circle, I shall not hear at all, which also will be well: indeed I do not recollect the thing since the Letter went, once in three days. However, it struck me at the time that an Educational Association should be set on foot in London above all; and become the mother of innumerable such all over the Empire. I actually put to paper one day a manifesto to that effect; which Mill, who alone has seen it, thought would perhaps promise something were the Parliamentary jargon a little slaked (and no Tories either out or else in): I mean to show it at least to any likely person, and perhaps <hi rend="italic">give</hi> a little industry to it. If I stir in any public matter, it must be in this.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350202-TC-JSM-01">&#x201C;National Education&#x201D; [ca. <date when="1835-02-03">3 Feb.</date>]</ref>. In it Carlyle refers to the &#x201C;Mother of <hi rend="small-caps">educational associations</hi> in all the towns of the Empire!&#x201D;</note> Radicalism goes on as fast as sane mortal would wish it, without help of mine; Conservativism <hi rend="italic">I</hi> cannot attempt to conserve, believing it to be a portentous embodied Sham, accursed of God, and doomed to destruction, as all lies are.

I could really <hi rend="italic">work</hi> heartily, and unite heartily with men in such a business; hardly in any other.

So behold me again at the &#x201C;Feast of Pikes&#x201D; (Federation of the <foreign>Champ de Mars</foreign>), to conclude that second volume with the death of Louis. I cannot tell thee what I think of the Book: it is certainly better, some ways, than any I have written hitherto; contains no falsehood, singularity or triviality that I can help; has small probably no chance of being liked by any existing class of British men: nevertheless I toil on, searching diligently, doing what I can, in old Samuel&#x2019;s faith that &#x201C;useful diligence will at last prevail.&#x201D;<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan.</date></ref></note> It is a very great comfort to me that I have the 
<pb id="pg-08-51" n="08:51"/>prospect of getting it printed, and so <hi rend="italic">being</hi> done with it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Genug davon</hi></foreign> [Enough of that]!&#x2014; I should have mentioned among my <hi rend="italic">Hypotheses</hi>, a Lecturing scheme in America! Emerson (you know who) sends another Letter full of gentlest regard, of devout encouragement; speaks of such a thing, with offers to inquire &#x26;c: I answer that he may at least <hi rend="italic">inquire</hi>, survey me the ground. Out of that I draw little hope at present. Mill&#x2019;s Periodical<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">London Review,</hi> the first number of which was to appear in <date when="1835-04-00">April</date>.</note> is to be out had this new Parliament declared itself (all waits on the Parliament; and there is such a clatter about who is to be Speaker next Thursday!):<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parliament was to open, <date when="1835-02-19">19 Feb.</date>, and although Sir Charles Manners-Sutton had been speaker since <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>, his reelection was to be opposed by the Whigs, who succeeded in getting their own man in, James Abercromby (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), M.P. for Edinburgh.</note> I believe, I might have Able-Editor employment <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, were I ready for it; but, as we agreed before, it seems better to wait, were my hands even <hi rend="italic">free</hi>. Mill is very friendly; he is the nearest approach to a real man that I find here; nay as far as negativeness goes he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> that man, but unhappily not very satisfactorily much farther. It is next to an impossibility that a London-born man should not be a stunted one. Most of them (as Hunt) are dwarfed and dislocated into the merest Imbecillities. Mill is a Presbyterian&#x2019;s grandson, or he were that too. Glory to John Knox! Our Isle never saw his fellow.</p>
<p>Did I tell you that the Bullers had <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> here? They are in their new house near Storey&#x2019;s Gate (Westminister), close by Willis&#x2019;s. We were at their Park Crescent house, one night, dining; all very good: Roebuck the Radical our main man; a smallest and neatest of men, miniature classical head, with miniature aquiline nose, screeching argumentative voice; radical-logic, limitation, vehemence, self-conceit&#x2014;all in the superlative. The little face, when you look close to it, is all minutely wrinkled; anger, dissatisfaction, vinaigrous (small-beer-aigrous) unrest looks painfully out from it: a hidebound barren man, with only audacity considerable; likest Robespierre of anything I have seen. Charles is become a main writer in the <hi rend="italic">Globe;</hi> and really does it well, lightly with suavity and vigour in the Newspaper way. What is to come out of <hi rend="italic">him</hi> I know not: hardly much; he is so light of purpose; were he not a very good fellow, they would spoil him with adulation and laudation; which they have not yet done. We were at Willis&#x2019;s one night, and had abundant beautiful music. He is a good innocent creature Willis,<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341224-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:357</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-12-24">24 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> sincere and pure as far as he goes.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am afraid I do not keep my promise and purpose to you so well as I ought in the writing way: it is the weakness of the ability not of the will. I sit here of late so very motionless over my task-sheet, that the world is almost foreign to me: I take no note of its ways; the flight of days and of weeks goes on unmarked, and I am astonished to find them departed. You get the Newspaper, happily still with its <hi rend="italic">two strokes;</hi> and will not be uneasy about me. Besides I think you <pb id="pg-08-54" n="08:54"/>know so much of my old punctuality as to be pretty sure that if anything really bad were happening, I would not keep you in ignorance. As to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [bother] of putting the Newspaper into the Post-Office, that is literally nothing; I go out to walk daily, and nearly always from choice go up towards the press of the Town (close <hi rend="italic">past</hi> the Post-Office): the tumult of these my brethren, sons of Adam, amuses me. How different from the lone musing stroll along the Glaisters Hill side! I never think of that now without a kind of shudder at it; of thankfulness that I am away from it.&#x2014; But indeed I ought to write to you more deliberately, and will (were this villainous Book once done): nay; there is hope that I shall see you again before very long, which will be far better!</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s letter when it came in reminded me that I had heard nothing from Annandale since the last time of writing to him; also that I had not written to you again as I meant.&#x2014; He is well, the worthy Doctor, and talks of home-coming! That late illness of Lady Clare&#x2019;s seems to have been a trying kind of predicament for him; and I think he managed with great honesty and discretion; really very <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. The &#x201C;Homoepathic Medicine&#x201D; he talks of is a thing the poor <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gomerals</hi></foreign> [Blockheads] are making a noise about here too: it is probably among the most perfect delusions of its day, as far as I can see into it. Neither for love nor for money let a man have <hi rend="italic">any</hi>thing to do with delusions in any place or at any time! Jack I trust will come back to us <hi rend="italic">grown</hi> in many respects: I hope we shall all meet again, for the better and not for the worse.</p>
<p>As to my own proceedings here, they amount to almost nothing, except the slow but determined progress my poor Book is making. I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> write it fast; I could write it fast enough, if I would write it ill: but that I have determined not to do&#x2014;wilfully. It will be bad enough <hi rend="italic">against</hi> one&#x2019;s will. O that I was done with it! But Patience! Patience! One must <hi rend="italic">go</hi> on,&#x2014;as we did at the Cressfield shearing [reaping]: were it but a sheaf cut, it will not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">loup in again</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310329-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:258</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1831-03-29">29 March 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> Hurry after all is of no use; one does nothing of any weight by <hi rend="italic">hurrying</hi>. Many a time I think of my good Father&#x2019;s method of working, how he went on &#x201C;without haste, without rest&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Goethe. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310610-TC-G-01"><sic>5:287</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1831-06-01">1 June 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> and did in that way the very most, I must believe, that he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do. I am not so wise in my trade; which indeed is more difficult to manage wisely.</p>
<p>However, you are not to suppose that I work myself into ill health. No; I really am not under my usual condition in that particular; <pb id="pg-08-55" n="08:55"/>rather above, I should say; for I take <hi rend="italic">no</hi> drugs now; and, for example, yesterday I walked upwards of eight miles (to and from the Bullers&#x2019;s old house; they are in a new one now, a mile and half nearer us) before dinner, and was not a whit exhausted. I am still in a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> sort of health, not as I used to be; nay I sometimes think, I shall get heartily healthy once more, and be a young brisk man&#x2014;turned of forty! In my mind I feel quite young yet; and <hi rend="italic">growing</hi>, as when I was eighteen: this is the greatest blessing.&#x2014; As to my outlooks here, and indeed as to the world and the ways of it, and <hi rend="italic">its</hi> usage of me better or worse, I cannot say that my heart is distressed, or will distress itself about it: it is God&#x2019;s world, and I am God&#x2019;s worker in it; well for me if I can <hi rend="italic">be</hi> that! I seem to see better and better that I have not wholly mistaken my calling, in that point of view; and as to the rest&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Good</hi> is our Maker; He will give us strength according to our burden.&#x2014; Hitherto the look of Literature as a trade is full of the wretchedest contradictions; nor do I see how any man that has more than meat to look for, and would <hi rend="italic">Keep</hi>, not a carriage, but a Conscience, can do much good in it as a getter of money. I have not found it very blessed in the way of <hi rend="italic">ease</hi> either as I worked at it: on the whole, if it do not show a fairer side, I will fling it from me, and seek bread <hi rend="italic">otherwise:</hi> there is bread to be had elsewhere; and I will think my thought, and write it down (as the Heavens enable me), and ask only Heaven&#x2019;s permission to do that. Accordingly I question if there is any man in London with as small a &#x201C;fixed capital,&#x201D; who carries his head as free, and will take fewer <foreign><hi rend="italic">dunts</hi></foreign> [blows] from man or thing than &#x201C;one Carl<hi rend="italic">yle</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Carlyle objected to this pronunciation of his name.&#x201D; Mary Carlyle&#x2019;s note.</note> of Craigenputtoch,&#x201D; worthy man,&#x2014;one of whose <hi rend="italic">toes</hi> is sore at this moment; which is his grand grievance. The truth is, dear Mother, I am <hi rend="italic">full</hi> of my task, and see it getting on; and think that is more than perhaps his Majesty can say: for me it ought to be enough. The Book will probably bring me no money; but I can do without that; and were it done and my hands free, I can write an &#x201C;Article&#x201D; or two again. They say it is going to be a tolerable enough Book; a queer Book, yes a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> queer Book.&#x2014; Jane&#x2019;s foot is quite whole, and her health, I think, as good as it has been for long. We go on very quietly here: &#x201C;indulge&#x201D; in a cup of hot coffee at eight o&#x2019;clock by way of breakfast: she then goes down stairs and leaves me the room to scribble in till one or two; then I walk or dig till four: dinner next of simple mutton chop and <hi rend="italic">&#x2019;tatie;</hi> a little music, reading, or by a time some solid friendly visitor (no <hi rend="italic">quack</hi> is at the pains to <pb id="pg-08-56" n="08:56"/>come so far), and so at ten our porridge come in, and &#x201C;all is by&#x201D; in a very innocent manner. You will be surprised to hear that I am fast losing my appetite for tea! The truth is, for one thing, <hi rend="italic">good</hi> tea is an article I have never tasted in London: the <hi rend="italic">water</hi> is all hard, full of solutions, salts &#x26;c &#x26;c; only strong coffee covers it right. When we put soda in ours here, it <hi rend="italic">hisses</hi> like an effervescing draught. But besides I do think my abstract love of Tea is diminishing; which I dare say you rejoice at, as at my declining consumpt<supplied>[ion]</supplied> of Tobacco. I have a set of Pipes here; of which I should so like to send you a gross (for they are your very kind): b<supplied>[ut]</supplied> alas, it is too far.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I am a great fool. I find I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> written to you within the prescribed time; that Jean&#x2019;s frank intervened since yours!&#x2014; Did she send you the ruled sheets? If so, you will not play me foul. Did you go to Annan? Jane is to write Mary a little Note tomorrow. We hear that poor old Mrs Irving seems not to be in a very strong state of mind: if you saw her, you would get little out of her but clatter. Poor body! it is perhaps a kind of mercy; for her trials, if she saw them, have been sore. Young Mrs Irving,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving&#x2019;s widow, Isabella.</note> I understand is here: but we keep on the other side of the causeway from her wishing her well from the distance. She is not a woman one can do good with: a woman that even wanting to be sincere <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be it. When I think what a hand she too (unconsciously and unwillingly) had in the ruin of my poor Friend, it fills me with pain.</p>
<p>Now when is the ruled sheet to come? I long to know all about you, how you are, what you are doing: I have still no right conjecture about all that. This I doubt is a wild time of weather with you: would you were here to see and feel these bright blue days, far the finest I ever saw in February! We had rigorous frost too for a day lately; Spring is Spring. Does Harry carry you; I mean can you ride in such wind and cold as you will have. Keep on a good fire, dear Mother! It is a damp wall that, and very unwholesome if you do not beat it back. O what a blessing that you are still able to go on so well. That you have a reasonable, acquiescing, hoping spirit! I thank you dear Mother a thousand times for the lessons you and my Father taught me; they are more precious than fine gold.&#x2014; I must write to Alick about the letting of his farm (<hi rend="italic">this</hi> was the day set for it): will Jamie excuse me another time. Jane&#x2019;s love to you all. <closer><salute>Good night, dear Mother!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I intended to write you a longish Letter; and behold I have literally only two minutes (not three) to write you in!</p>
<p>During these last days I have been very frequently thinking of you: I saw Catlinns in the Newspaper; and think <hi rend="italic">Yesterday</hi> you would probably be at Dumfries, and see now some new scene before you. Take a pen my brave fellow and tell me all <hi rend="italic">how it is;</hi> what you are scheming now, what you think of it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick was to write on <date when="1835-02-21">21 Feb.</date> Catlinns was open to offer by tenants at Dumfries on <date when="1835-02-17">17 Feb.</date>, and he was no doubt looking for other prospects.</note> I know you are not afraid. Stout heart to the steepest <foreign>brae</foreign>!</p>
<p>For my own part I cannot say that I feel very sorry to consider you out of that bleak <hi rend="italic">Mud</hi> Concern; or indeed out of farming altogether, if that be the way of it. No <hi rend="italic">prosperity</hi> is to be looked for in that. Prices will <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> cheap, I doubt; the cheapness comes from <hi rend="italic">Irish</hi> corn, they say; and certainly also from the <hi rend="italic">poverty</hi> of all people&#x2014;obliged to eat potatoes.</p>
<p>Do you think of going to Annan? You will need no <hi rend="italic">servants</hi> there. I can fancy Jenny and you much snugger there; Jenny thrifty, you industrious. God direct you, my dear Brother!</p>
<p>And so I must off. Jane is waiting for me at a <hi rend="italic">halfway</hi> house she has; for we are going to dine with some people of Mill&#x2019;s: called Taylor, a rather goodish set of persons. How much happier should I be at this moment to step over to Catlinns; have two <hi rend="italic">bowls</hi> of Jenny&#x2019;s tea-and-egg<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310420-JWC-EA-01"><sic>5:265</sic><corr>JWC to EA, <date when="1831-04-20">20 April 1831</date></corr></ref>, &#x201C;a highly nutritive beverage of tea and whipt egg.&#x201D;</note> (the best tea I have tasted since last there) and spend the evening with <hi rend="italic">you!</hi> But it is a bit too far.&#x2014; We must be content.</p>
<p>Write now, and may all good be with you! We are to see one another in summer I hope.</p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I think my Annandale Correspondence seems fated to &#x201C;clash together&#x201D; in point of time: your Letter seems to have left Ecclefechan the very day mine must have got to hand (for it would arrive there on Saturday); and on the prior occasion, it was the very same thing that happened. Having done my &#x201C;bit task&#x201D; tonight, and an hour being still left, I will try to rectify that. Our Mother will soon hear of it from Catlinns; will fulfil her kind promise to me, and all will be in the right train. Her precious little Postscript gave me great satisfaction; and proves (you may tell her) to demonstration that she needs only ruled paper and good will; which last I know she has <hi rend="italic">by</hi> her.</p>
<p>The Proverb says, Better a finger off than ay wagging.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. J. Kelly, <hi rend="italic">Scottish Proverbs</hi>, &#x201C;Better finger off as ay wagging.&#x201D;</note> I will not regret that you are done with that <foreign><hi rend="italic">glarry</hi></foreign> [muddy] business of Catlinns; that now the world is all before you where to choose.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, XII, 646.</note> There is a probability that farm-stock will not be much <hi rend="italic">lower</hi>, at any rate, about Whitsunday; so your calculation, favourable for the present, may be found to hold good then: and thus with &#x201C;private capital&#x201D; rather increased, with health, and a free heart and conscience, you can take the <foreign>bent</foreign> [wild grass]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;You can take to your travels.&#x201D;</note> again. I wish I knew what were really wisest for you. For <hi rend="italic">a wisest</hi> thing there indubitably is; only we with our poor eyes cannot always discern it. I, in particular, so far off, so inexperienced in the whole matter, can give you no counsel that has more to recommend it than best intention. You do well to ask counsel of the Heavens, and man&#x2019;s Great Guide there. New enterprises are always best entered on in that solemn feeling of dependence: in various senses that I can see, it is truly written, &#x201C;He that seeketh <hi rend="italic">findeth</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 7:8.</note>&#x2014; On the whole, however, you are not to take <hi rend="italic">gloomy</hi> views, for there is nothing to mourn at, to despond at: a serious cheerfulness; that is the right mood in this as in all cases.</p>
<p>It is my impression that you ought not to meddle again with farms, at least not this year, when the season is spent, and so much is discouraging in that direction. In fact, I rather still incline to <pb id="pg-08-59" n="08:59"/>Conjecture that Farming is henceforth no good trade in Scotland or Britain; not a better trade than others; a worse than several. We have often talked over that matter: high rents, low prices; a hungry set of Landlords (for I believe they too are sunk in debt), a population which, whatever Newspaper &#x201C;Prosperities of Trade&#x201D; and so forth may say, is (and even must be) struggling deeper and deeper into destitution, and inability to purchase anything but Potatoes;&#x2014;these, with the enormous competition, are fatal circumstances for farming. Farming in America were something,&#x2014;on your own land! For the Sky is bounteous there as here, and the Sky&#x2019;s bounty is not then whisked away, as by art magic, into hands that have not toiled for it. At the worst I always look to America.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The local press (particularly the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>) frequently carried advertisements in connection with emigration at about this time from shipping and banking companies and from land companies selling farming plots in Canada.</note> Perhaps, as to Scottish farming, it is well that you are rid of that.</p>
<p>Nothing else suggests itself to me as so likely for you as going down to Annan. There is always, and must always be, a good deal of trading in grain and farm-produce; in the management of which, a man that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> manage it with discretion, punctuality, energy, must find some sort of reward. What degree of reward it is at present, I know not at all, but you do or can learn; and as for your fitness to work in that way, I have always understood it to be very considerable, and that, if you would improve more and more in <hi rend="italic">Punctuality</hi> (which is the Soul of all Commerce) it might decidedly become superior, and I know not how much so. But the danger all over Annandale (perhaps less in Annan than elsewhere) is that miserable habit of <foreign><hi rend="italic">jaffling</hi></foreign> [overworking], in all senses of the word: you must guard sternly and continually against that. I have also noticed that you are too sanguine or vehement (which is also a fault of my own), and take in more work than you can accomplish: this is a great enemy to Punctuality (one so often fails, and gets into the habit of failing), an &#x201C;enemy to <foreign>verta</foreign> [virtue]&#x201D; in general. Lastly the whole breed of us have &#x201C;a dibble of a temper.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech: see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230326-TC-JBW-01"><sic>2:316</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1823-03-26">26 March 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> These, my dear Brother, are the things to be striven with, to be better and better subdued: it is really my opinion that you were then <hi rend="italic">well qualified</hi> for that kind of industry, and might find yourself more at home thereby in Annan than anywhere you have yet been. There are really some trustworthy and regular-working substantial characters there; with whom by degrees you would get into the proper footing, and find it profitable every <pb id="pg-08-60" n="08:60"/>way. I think they are the best people I know about in our county. The loose, the vague, irregular that have no rule or plan of conducting themselves, (of whom also there are plenty), you will naturally shun: there may be profit away from such; <hi rend="italic">with</hi> such it is not possible that profit can be.&#x2014; Think therefore what you might earn by trading in (say) corn and meal, no farther than you already see and understand such trade. If it would suffice to support you, I think you might go with no hesitation, with alacrity. A house and park (cow&#x2019;s grass, at any rate) cannot cost very much; and with no servant, and a wife faithfully disposed to do the best, and who will learn better and better to do it, you can be far more comfortable than heretofore (with such a set of <foreign><hi rend="italic">gillenyers</hi></foreign>);<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Great, lazy gluttons (this is the meaning attached to the word in Annandale).&#x201D; Mary Aitken Carlyle&#x2019;s note. Another meaning is &#x201C;cheats&#x201D; or &#x201C;swindlers.&#x201D;</note> you may live there in a still but assiduously industrious way, putting your hand no farther than the sleeve will let: I think there is a fair prospect, that <hi rend="italic">fitness</hi> for your employment would really bring recompense in it; better and better recompense as you grew fitter.&#x2014; You see, I have it all cut and dry for you, as if I knew it all. But you will not forget that I properly know nothing of it, as it practically, at the moment, <hi rend="italic">is:</hi> you will correct my theory where you find it and the reality part company. What says Ben Nelson?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210109-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:304</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-09">9 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> His advice is worth taking; tho&#x2019; nobody at bottom can <hi rend="italic">advise</hi> one. He will speak what he says with as much <hi rend="italic">conviction</hi> as most men: he is one whom I should like extremely to find you got as much intercourse with as circumstances would allow; I have met with very few men in the world of a clearer mind whether as regards understanding or moral character: a <hi rend="italic">well-made</hi> man, with more stuff in him than I have known famed men made of; nay not one famed man in five hundred is such as he. Give him my friendliest remembrances; say, if he were not the laziest of correspondents, he might write to me; but must not forget to think of me whether or not.&#x2014; One other thing I have a kind of notion of: that a house <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the town were better than one near it; you lie far readier both for things and for persons, and have advantages in that way greater than at first sight you would fancy. But doubtless you will lay all things together, and make the fittest choice you can. You spoke once of some little patch of a farm; at the Howes,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander&#x2019;s next home, about half a mile west of Annan.</note> for instance: but perhaps it were better if none such offered; I have observed, that <hi rend="italic">two</hi> strings to our bow (contrary to the Proverb, in one sense), are apt to be <hi rend="italic">both</hi> ill bent, to confuse one another, and <pb id="pg-08-61" n="08:61"/>prove worse than a single one.&#x2014; Finally my dear Brother, set your heart bravely to it; with deliberate, cheerful energy: make no league with what is evil; cast out the fault, the sin that you feel to be encumbering you (and make solemn self-examination to that end); take God for your help, and, with humble trust in Him, fear nothing earthly. I send you my blessing and best prayers: and make little doubt but I shall learn that you have resolved on something wise, and are deliberating and resolutely prosecuting it. &#x201C;Without haste but without rest&#x201D;: that is the way.</p>
<p>As I apprehend you will not get this at any rate at the Post-Office for a day or two (Newspaper-day being past), I will not seal tonight; but add a few words if I have leisure tomorrow night. There is still so much to say, for I have sent you no account of anything here. It is now past supper-time, Jane has left me, and I say: Good night!&#x2014; There is a wild <hi rend="italic">blustering</hi> wind; which I doubt is wilder at Catlinns&#x2014;Good night.</p>

<p><date when="1835-02-27">29<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> (at Night).&#x2014;Dear Alick,&#x2014;I was prevented putting pen to paper yesternight by a Radical Glasgow Editor, who came bouncing in; one Weir,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300405-TC-HI-01"><sic>5:88</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1830-04-05">5 April 1830</date></corr></ref> and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350313-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1835-03-13">13 March</date>]</ref>.</note> Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Argus</hi>, among the noisiest, <hi rend="italic">half-daftest</hi>, most boisterous (not ill-intentioned) characters I have met with in my life. He is from Dumfries originally; was an Advocate in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, without employment, where I used to see a little of him. He is here looking into the &#x201C;actual working&#x201D; of the new Parliament: a most thankless job, I should think. The poor fellow has no kinsman on Earth; lost all his money too, by a bankruptcy: in spite of his rude Radicalism, I cannot but be kindly <foreign>wae</foreign> for him and wish him well.&#x2014; I will finish you out however tonight: a frank may be got tomorrow.</p>
<p>What a wretched hand your poor <foreign>Laird</foreign> has made of himself: it is among the most distracted things ever seen; but natural enough; for the poor man had no head (or brain but mere vanity and <hi rend="italic">wind</hi>), and <hi rend="italic">without head</hi>, one flies strange courses. I doubt it will go ill with him: if his Egyptian helpmate begin to <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> his gear for him, the only principle he ever had will break down, and he in desperation may take to drinking for what I see. But perhaps she will not, being now <hi rend="italic">leddy</hi>. You cannot help him, nor no man can; but only pity him from afar.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had also mentioned the latest local scandal in his letter of <date when="1835-02-21">21 Feb.</date> about the &#x201C;<foreign>laird</foreign> of Dogslacks&#x201D; who had just married. His wife was &#x201C;from Buecastle and sprung from the antient gipsiys&#x2014;her mother a traveling basket-woman and notable breeder of bastardes.&#x201D; She had left his service at Whitsun, and, &#x201C;banished by the parish-authorities took up her abode with Dalston Roddick at Middlebie &#x2026; having an eye to wed with the poor <foreign>laird</foreign> &#x2026; at which insolent designing conduct&#x201D; he &#x201C;took great offence.&#x201D; There had been a legal wrangle, and then a sudden turn of events; since, directly the <foreign>laird</foreign> discovered that he had fathered a son and heir, he &#x201C;rushed off to Middlebie&#x201D; to marry his &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">clarty</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [dirty] bride!</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-62" n="08:62"/>I may say truly, Clow of Land&#x2019;s liking to <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> is a real satisfaction to me; among the more genuine I have had from that Book.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the same letter, Alexander Carlyle also mentioned that he was consulting Ben Nelson and William Graham, and that the latter was &#x201C;full to overflowing of Teufelsdrockhism nay, in some sence turned a sort of Teufelsdrockh himself&#x2014;boundless and lavish&#x201D; in praise of the piece about Irving that Carlyle had written for <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi>. Alick then suggested that it would be &#x201C;a deed of kindness,&#x201D; if he had a &#x201C;spare Teufelsdrockh,&#x201D; to send a copy to &#x201C;Clow of land who yields not even to Graham in high admiration of that same strange, misterious, unpretending personage&#x201D;; cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341224-TC-WG-01"><sic>7:349</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1834-12-24">24 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> That it comes home to an earnest mind, so far away from it in every sense, is proof that there is earnest stuff in it; and should and does please me much more than any flimsy Review-praise it could have got from any Critic now going. I unluckily have not one other copy, or the worthy neighbour should have it: perhaps it may be reprinted as a <supplied>[B]</supplied>ook one day, and then (if it be in our time) we may have another chance. I feel pret<supplied>[ty]</supplied> much inclined to believe that had it been published in that fashion at first, it might actually h<supplied>[ave]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. Several persons do more than like it. My last copy was solicited from me (thro&#x2019; the Bullers) very lat<supplied>[ely]</supplied> by a Sir W. Molesworth, a young Squire, of Radical-Utilitarian temper, but solid English material; much to my surprise; for of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> whole Philosophy <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is subversive. He is the man who has given (to Mill&#x2019;s charge) &#xa3;2,000 (for he is rich enough) to set agoing that <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> of theirs. The first N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>. of it is coming out soon.&#x2014;&#x2014; As for the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>, the worst fault of it is, it gets on so dreadfully <hi rend="italic">slowly</hi>. I think otherwise it is better than anything I have done; for it rests upon a <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>, upon truths; and if I had done <hi rend="italic">my best</hi> with it, I will very cheerfully tumble it forth to let the world do <hi rend="italic">its</hi> best or its worst. <supplied>[Fr]</supplied>aser has it advertised as &#x201C;getting ready&#x201D; in his next <hi rend="italic">Magazine</hi> N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>.</p>
<p>The party we had at the Taylors&#x2019;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At John and Harriet Taylor&#x2019;s on <date when="1835-02-18">18 Feb.</date>, &#x201C;a pleasant kind of night; for which however I have had to pay by a week&#x2019;s sickness.&#x2014; Today again, tho&#x2019; I did <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> yesternight but drink three cups of tea, I have awoke about five o&#x2019;clock; and have before me the prospect of a wrecked day.&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1835-02-26">26 Feb.</date>)</note> was most brisk, and the cleverest (best gifted) I have been at for years: Mill, Charles Buller (one of the gayest, highly-sparkling, loveable souls in the world), <hi rend="italic">Repository</hi> Fox (who <foreign><hi rend="italic">hotches</hi></foreign> [heaves] and laughs at least), Fonblanque the <pb id="pg-08-63" n="08:63"/><hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> Editor,&#x2014;were the main men. It does one good; tho&#x2019; I buy it dear, dining so late: towards eight o&#x2019;clock!&#x2014; I have also seen Southey the Poet (at another Taylor&#x2019;s,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle noted in the <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;<date when="1835-02-26">26<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Feby.</date>&#x2014; Went last night (in wet-bad weather) to Taylor&#x2019;s [Henry Taylor&#x2019;s] to meet Southey; who received me kindly. A lean grey-white-headed man, of dusky complexion, &#x26; unexpectedly tall when he rises, and still <hi rend="italic">leaner</hi> then. The shallowest chin, prominent snubbed-Roman nose; small care-lined brow, huge bush of white-grey hair on high crown, and projecting on all sides; the most <hi rend="italic">vehement</hi> pair of faint-hazel eyes I have ever seen. Our talk was of Dutch Poets (Vondel &#x26;c, whom he had read), of Orators, Colonies, Schools, Swift, Sterne, Berkeley, Burke: all in the touch-and-go way. A well-read, honest, limited (strait-laced even) kindly-hearted, most irritable man. We parted kindly; with no great purpose on either side, I imagine, to meet again. De Quincey was mentioned in answer to a question of mine: &#x2018;Yes, I do know him,&#x2019; answered Southey, &#x2018;and know him to be a great rascal: and if you have opportunity I will thank you to tell him so&#x2019;: his brown-dun face was overspread suddenly almost with black. I &#x2018;trusted&#x2019; in return that &#x2018;some other than I might be the bearer of that comfortable message, as I had no intercourse with De Q., and had not seen him for seven years.&#x2019; The fault was some stuff poor De Q. had been writing in <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> about Coleridge. I got the thing at last wound up with a hearty laugh.&#x2014; S. believes in the Church of England: this is notable; notable (and honourable) that he has made such belief serve him so well.&#x201D;</note>
where is one of the finest old women ever discovered: a Miss Fenwick from Northumberland):<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Fenwick (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), daughter of Nicholas and Dorothy Fenwick of Edlingham, Northumberland, who was a close friend of Henry Taylor, and also of the Wordsworths from about <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>. Mary Moorman writes of her as &#x201C;Well read without being a blue-stocking; religious without being sentimental or bigoted; vivacious, warm-hearted, and sensible&#x201D; (Mary Moorman, <hi rend="italic">William Wordsworth. The Later Years</hi> [Oxford, <date when="1965-00-00">1965</date>], pp. 541&#x2013;42).</note> Southey is lean as a harrow; <hi rend="italic">dun</hi> as a tobacco-<foreign><hi rend="italic">spluchan</hi></foreign> [pouch]; <hi rend="italic">no</hi> chin (I mean the smallest), <hi rend="italic">snubbed</hi> Roman nose, vehement brown eyes, huge <hi rend="italic">white</hi> head of hair; when he rises,&#x2014;all legs together. We had considerable talk together: he is a man positive in his own Tory Church of England way; well informed, rational; a good man; but perhaps so striking for nothing, as for his excitability and irritability, which I should judge to be preeminent even among Poets. We parted kindly; and might be ready to meet again. He lives at Keswick (in Cumberland there); thinks the world is sinking to ruin, and writes diligently. There are few sensible mortals anywhere: I suppose the best stock of them might be looked for here. We do not see many people; yet enough for our purposes; and could see more. The Bullers are very agreeable; <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Charles was down yesterday, and played a Game at Chess with Jane: I like him ever the better were he not so <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi>. But on the whole there is nothing I find more profitable than to be left alone with my <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi>. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">They</hi> can do&#x2019; tha naither ill na&#x2019; good&#x201D;!

The <hi rend="italic">noise</hi> long since has become indifferent to me: <hi rend="italic">here</hi> at any rate we have no noise; but at night are as still as you.&#x2014; One final fact I will mention: that we broke into the Catlinns <hi rend="italic">Ham</hi> yesterday, and found it genuine, of first rate quality, and mean to eat a fraction of it daily at breakfast.&#x2014; Jane will write a word of good-will tomorrow: I cannot afford you more than this other half-sheet; which, alas, is done! My &#x201C;Counsels&#x201D; seem all what they did to me yet: I shall wait very anxiously how you decide: but indeed you are not called to decide rashly. Good night, my dear Brother!

<salute>Dear James of Scotsbrig,</salute>
<p>I send you this <hi rend="italic">scrape of a Pen</hi> by way of memorial that I still love you; and as thanks for the like assurance sent by you some time ago. If it have no other value at all, you will not think it worthless.</p>
<p>I get no account of you as Head of a Family; for in your postscript you seemed not so much as to remember that you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> a better half: a sad forgetfulness, man; and far too early in date yet! For it is written, a man shall cleave unto his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 2:24.</note> that is the text, make of it what you will.&#x2014; But the serious truth is, I am very glad to believe you going on well at Scotsbrig, in your new relation; making diligent head against whatsoever evil may arise, and beating it down; living as a good husband, a good son; a good husband<hi rend="italic">man:</hi> it is one of the enviablest lots one could get in this vexed and vexing world. Make my renewed regards to your wife; whom I hope to know better yet. My Mother told Jean once that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> (your wife) seemed to <supplied>[be]</supplied> more careful about all being right up stairs than you were. Tell her I shall be doubly grateful to her for any kindness there. Peace and affection is very blessed: not to be had pure in this Earth; but if people all mean <hi rend="italic">honestly</hi>, I have noticed that temporary variations come always round again, and one gets along handsomely after all. My Mother says always that she is very comfortable: I believe, no child she has born would not cheerfully part his last resource with her, if she needed it. Ill would it become us: she never spared herself for us in the past season; but spent and was spent like the truest Mother. We have all reason to thank Heaven for her.</p>
<p>It is well for you that you can &#x201C;go on as usual&#x201D; this year; for it seems every where to be among the worst for Farmers. No trade is good. One <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> help it: there is no method but diligence and thriftiness; these two in your position, happily, one can hope, will still suffice.&#x2014; I suppose you are far on with ploughing; the winter has been so mild. We have rain now, and even spits of sleet; and winds by which I hear of panes broken. Hitherto it has been the driest country I ever saw: our rain-barrel was never full till lately. The people seem to me sluttish <hi rend="italic">weedy</hi> farmers; and trust mostly to <hi rend="italic">manure</hi>.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-66" n="08:66"/>What would you think of a man ploughing with from three to five horses all in a string, and a stout goadsman to help him?

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The miserablest accident (as we name such things) of my whole life has just befallen me; almost the only <hi rend="italic">accident</hi> of any magnitude I <pb id="pg-08-67" n="08:67"/>had ever to complain of. I learned last night that my whole First Volume, by the silliest oversight and mistake (not on my part or my wife&#x2019;s), had <hi rend="italic">been destroyed</hi>, except some three or four bits of leaves; and so the labour of five steadfast enough months had vanished irrecoverably; <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than if it had never been! I can be angry with no one; for they that were concerned in it have a far deeper sorrow than mine: it is purely the hand of Providence; and, by the blessing of Providence, I must struggle to take it as such,&#x2014;in which case (as I trust you too understand) it would not be loss but gain.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is hard to get at the truth of this famous story, though Carlyle&#x2019;s part in it is clear. He had lent the manuscript of the first volume of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> to Mill, which was almost all that he had written. Then, on <date when="1835-03-06">6 March</date>, &#x201C;Mill&#x2019;s rap was heard at the door: he entered pale, unable to speak; gasped out to my wife to go down and speak with Mrs. Taylor; and came forward (led by my hand, and astonished looks) the very picture of desperation. After various inarticulate and articulate utterances to merely the same effect, he informs me that my <hi rend="italic">First Volume</hi> (left out by him in too careless a manner, after or while reading it) was, except four or five bits of leaves, <hi rend="italic">irrevocably</hi> ANNIHILATED! I remembered and can still remember less of it than anything I ever wrote with such toil: <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is gone, the whole world and myself backed by it could not bring that back: nay the old spirit too is fled. I find that it took five months of steadfast occasionally excessive and always sickly and painful toil. <hi rend="italic">It is gone;</hi> and will not return.&#x2014; Mill very injudiciously staid with us till late; and I had to make an effort and speak as if indifferently about other common matters; he left us however in a <hi rend="italic">relapsed</hi> state; one of the pitiablest.&#x2014; My dear wife has been very kind, and become dearer to me. The night has been full of emotion; occasionally sharp pain (something cutting or hard&#x2014;grasping me round the heart) occasionally with sweet consolations. I dreamed of my Father and sister Margaret alive, yet all defaced with the sleepy stagnancy, swoln hebetude of the Grave,&#x2014;and again dying, as in some strange rude country: a horrid dream! The painfullest too when you wake first. But, on the whole, should I not thank the Unseen? For I was not driven out of composure, hardly for moments. &#x2018;Walk <hi rend="italic">humbly</hi> with thy God.&#x2019; How I longed for some Psalm or Prayer that I could have <hi rend="italic">uttered</hi>; that my loved ones would have joined me in! But there was none: Silence had to be my language.&#x2014; This morning I have determined so far that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> still write <hi rend="italic">a</hi> Book on the F.R., and will do it. Nay, our money will still suffice. It was my last throw, my <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> staked in the monstrosity of this Life (for too monstrous incomprehensible it has been to me): I will not <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> the game, while faculty is given me to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> playing. Have written to Fraser to buy me a <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle</hi> (a kind of <hi rend="italic">increasing</hi> of the Stake as on <hi rend="italic">loss</hi> some practice); and fresh paper: mean to huddle up the <hi rend="italic">F&#x26;circ;te des Piques;</hi> and look farther (back or forward <hi rend="italic">first</hi> is uncertain) what can be attempted&#x201D; (<date when="1835-03-07">7 March</date> <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>). The incident is also recalled in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> (intr. I. Campbell, <date when="1972-00-00">1972</date>, pp. 72&#x2013;73); and Froude notes that as soon as Mill had gone Carlyle remarked, &#x201C;Well, Mill, poor fellow, is terribly cut up; we must endeavour to hide from him how very serious this business is to us&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, III, 28).<lb/><lb/>
So considerate were the Carlyles that they did not press Mill, and he never gave them a clear account. Carlyle seems clear that the manuscript was burnt as he constantly refers to it as &#x201C;burnt&#x201D; in subsequent letters, but even Jane, who went down to see Harriet Taylor who was waiting, learned no more. It is natural that, as a result, there have been various attempts to account for what happened. On the one hand it has been assumed that Mill left the papers lying about at home, in Church St., Kensington, where he was living with his parents. On the other hand, it is supposed that he may have read them with Mrs. Taylor at the Taylors&#x2019; house in Kent Terrace, and that the carelessness may have been hers. There is the third possibility, that Mrs. Taylor and Mill may have read them together at a cottage she had somewhere outside London, and that this may have been the reason for Mill&#x2019;s embarrassed silence.<lb/><lb/>
Such evidence as there is, is slight. On Mill&#x2019;s death an anonymous obituary in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> (<date when="1873-05-10">10 May 1873</date>) attributed the accident to Mrs. Taylor. As a result Mill&#x2019;s sister Harriet wrote to Carlyle on <date when="1873-05-15">15 May 1873</date> because, she said, &#x201C;If I am right, I should much wish to have this published account corrected. I cannot think that my brother would have shewn your manuscript to anyone, without your permission.&#x201D; She also said that she could, &#x201C;perfectly well, remember our search&#x201D; at home. &#x2026; &#x201C;My brother would surely have told you exactly how the disaster had come about&#x201D; (NLS, MS, 666.109). Yet, in reply, Carlyle explained that on <date when="1835-03-06">6 March</date>, &#x201C;my impression really was &#x2026; that Mrs. Taylor&#x2019;s house &#x26; some trifling neglect there, had been the cause of the catastrophe;&#x2014;but in fact, to prevent him almost perishing with excess of misery, we had to forbear all questioning on the subject&#x201D; (NLS, MS, 1778.1).<lb/><lb/>
Then, on <date when="1881-02-07">7 Feb. 1881</date>, a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> obituary for Carlyle stated that the manuscript had been lost after Mill had &#x201C;handed it to &#x2026; his future wife. What became of it was never exactly known.&#x201D; A correspondent, signing himself F.W.R. put forward the story (<date when="1881-02-12">12 Feb.</date>) that it had got into the hands of &#x201C;Mr. Mill&#x2019;s cook&#x201D;; and Harriet Mill then wrote once more (<date when="1881-02-17">17 Feb.</date>) to say that &#x201C;Valuable papers were not left about in Mr. Mill&#x2019;s house, nor was the disaster owing to him, beyond the fact that he had lent the manuscript to the person at whose house it was destroyed.&#x201D; She added that, &#x201C;having heard Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s own account of all that passed between him and Mr. Mill &#x2026; I can safely say that none of the statements in the letter of &#x2018;F.W.R.&#x2019; agree with the facts of the case.&#x201D;<lb/><lb/>
As they grew older, none of them grew clearer. But when Charles Eliot Norton told Carlyle of Mill&#x2019;s death, Carlyle apparently said: &#x201C;She [Mrs. Taylor] had it at her house on the riverside at Kingston [Keston?], and I never shall forget the dismay on John Mill&#x2019;s face when he came to tell me that the housemaid had lighted the fire with it.&#x201D; It was &#x201C;a small house,&#x201D; Norton explained, &#x201C;where Mill was in the habit of going on Saturdays to spend the next day, and whither Carlyle had sometimes been in his company.&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, ed. Sara Norton and M. A. DeWolfe Howe, [London, <date when="1913-00-00">1913</date>] I, 496&#x2013;98, quoting Norton&#x2019;s journal of <date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>).<lb/><lb/>
Exactly where this country house or cottage was is another question, but the story has some weight. Harriet Mill was right to wonder how it could happen that, in a house such as the Mills&#x2019;, used to the ways of authors, any servant could destroy papers left lying about. Mrs. Taylor is known to have had a country place of her own, and the expression that it happened in &#x201C;her&#x201D; house, rather than specifically Kent Terrace where she lived with her husband, is ambiguous. Whatever happened, perhaps Friday evening was a suitable time for Mill to return to the manuscript; but if he had left it out of town at Mrs. Taylor&#x2019;s place, it would not only explain his discovering the loss at the beginning of a weekend, but the accident is more easily accounted for, and so is the oddity that Mrs. Taylor should have accompanied him on his breaking the news to the Carlyles.<lb/><lb/>
There is no further explanation in subsequent letters. There are a few surviving pages of this part of the Manuscript, on poor quality paper, at the Carlyle House, Chelsea.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-68" n="08:68"/><hi rend="italic">That</hi> first volume (which pleased me better than anything I had ever done) <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be written anew, for the spirit that animated it is <pb id="pg-08-69" n="08:69"/>past: but <hi rend="italic">another</hi> first volume I will try, and shall make it, if not better or equal, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that I can. This only is clear to me: that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write a Book on the French Revolution; and that, if I am spared long enough alive I will do it. Your Announcement<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had noted in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> for <date when="1835-02-26">26 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;The Book <hi rend="italic">announced</hi> yesterday. That is, Fraser sent me down for revisal the printed leaf he means to announce it by. Would that I were further on with it!&#x201D; The notice appeared in the <date when="1835-03-00">March</date> <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s:</hi> &#x201C;In 3 vols. small 8vo, / The French Revolution: / A History / In Three Books, / By Thomas Carlyle. / Book I. The Bastille. Book II. The Constitution. / Book III. The Guillotine.&#x201D;</note> (which several persons were just yesterday congratulating me on the hopeful look of) need not therefore be repeated for some months again? I <hi rend="italic">suppose</hi> this; but it is <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that are to judge and decide about that; with the knowledge that I, tooth and nail, am standing to the enterprise, and advancing daily, were it but at snail&#x2019;s pace, as fast as is in me, to the fulfilment of it. I think the whole Book (if the Unseen Powers be propitious to me) may be ready against next publishing season; not the <date when="1835-10-00">October</date> time, but the one which succeeds that. It may, as I said and do believe, be for <hi rend="italic">good</hi> yet to us all.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances will you put out your hand, and help me in some little things. In the first place, <hi rend="italic">do not mention</hi> the mischance to any one: it would give great pain to some whom I love were it ever talked of; and could do no good. In the second place you must get me a <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle</hi>;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle, ancienne et moderne</hi>, 52 vols., A to Z (Paris, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">28</date>). Carlyle&#x2019;s set with eight supplementary volumes, A to CHE (<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date>), was sold at Sotheby&#x2019;s, <date when="1937-06-13">13 June 1937</date>.</note> for like a bold gambler, having lost this throw, I am determined to <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> the stakes, before throwing again. Let the <hi rend="italic">Biog. Universelle</hi> therefore be bought, since I can get it no otherwise and have often felt the want of having it <hi rend="italic">close by</hi>: you, by your knowledge of <hi rend="italic">second-hand</hi> Booksellers &#x26;c will get it far cheaper than I can; let it be a bound copy or half-bound (easy to turn the leaves of); I care not for any other property:&#x2014;except indeed, which I think is not the case, there be more than one Edition; you would then of course ascertain which was best, and take that.&#x2014; In the third place, pray try to get me more <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> that were perfectly suitable: I was at one Hodge&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Spalding and John Hodge (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), stationers and papermakers, 147 Drury Lane.</note> (I think) in Drury Lane, where there was large choice and much cheaper but that too did not wholly answer. I inclose you a sheet the last of my old Dumfries stock (on which <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> was written): both in size and texture (<hi rend="italic">ink</hi>-taking &#x26;c) and every way, it is the best kind: if you could get it completely matched, I could take a <hi rend="italic">ream</hi> or so. It were better however (indeed <pb id="pg-08-70" n="08:70"/>indispensably prudent) to send me a sheet first by way of specimen. <hi rend="italic">Do not</hi> especially forget to return me the inclosed sheet; which you see has indications on it.&#x2014; Finally the sooner these two things can be done for me, it will be the kinder.</p>
<p>Your Boy at this moment has entered with the pretty-looking Prospectuses!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Prospectuses are untraced, and were perhaps much like the announcements of n. 2.</note> They make one sad to look upon them. Nevertheless, by God&#x2019;s blessing, they shall not be wholly useless one day, if not this day.</p>
<p>Now observe what I have spoken, and in what spirit towards you I speak it: the spirit of one who has faith in you not as a Tradesman only but as a man.</p>
<p>I hope to hear from you early in the week. Do not pity me; forward me rather as a runner that tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">tripped</hi> down, will not lie there, but rise and run again.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>How are you? You left me last night with a look which I shall not soon forget. Is there anything that I could do or suffer or say to alleviate you? For I feel that your sorrow must be far sharper than mine; yours bound to be a <hi rend="italic">passive</hi> one. How true is this of Richter: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">All</hi> Evil is like a Nightmare; the instant you begin to <hi rend="italic">stir</hi> under it, it is <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300211-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:72</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-02-11">11 Feb. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I have ordered a <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle</hi> this morning;&#x2014;and a better sort of paper. Thus, far from giving up the game, you see, I am risking another &#xa3;10 on it. Courage, my friend!</p>
<p>That I can never write <hi rend="italic">that</hi> Volume again is indubitable: singular enough, the whole Earth could not get <hi rend="italic">it</hi> back; but only a better or a worse one. There is the strangest dimness over it. A figure thrown into the melting-pot; but the metal (all that was golden or goldlike of that,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> can be gathered) is there; the model also <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, in <pb id="pg-08-71" n="08:71"/>my head. O my friend, how easily might the bursting of some puny ligament or filament have abolished all light <hi rend="italic">there</hi> too!</p>
<p>That I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write a Book on the French Revolution is (God be thanked for it) as clear to me as ever; also that, if life be given me so long, I will. To it again, therefore! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Andar con Dios</hi></foreign> [Go with God]!</p>
<p>I think you once said you could borrow me a <hi rend="italic">Campan?</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331028-TC-JSM-01"><sic>7:21</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-10-28">28 Oct. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> Have you any more of Lacretelle&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Charles Dominique de Lacretelle (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), historian and journalist, had been actively engaged in the revolution, author of the last five volumes of <hi rend="italic">Pr&#xE9;cis historique de la R&#xE9;volution Fran&#x26;ccedil;aise</hi> (Paris, <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">6</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Histoire de France pendant le dix-huiti&#xE8;me si&#xE8;cle</hi> (Paris, <date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826-00-00">26</date>).</note> things; his 18<hi rend="italic">me Siecle?</hi> (that is of almost no moment).

Had I been a <hi rend="italic">trained</hi> Compiler, I should not have wanted that. To make some search for it, I know, will be a kind of solace for you.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mrs Taylor for her kind sympathies. May God guide, and bless you both! That is my true prayer&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My friend,</salute>
<p>You shall do the thing you so earnestly entreat for: it is not unreasonable; <foreign><hi rend="italic">ungigmanic</hi></foreign> it may either be or not be. How lucky, in this as in other instances, that neither of us has money for the lifting; that neither of us is wealthy, and one of us poor! It has positively hereby become a case which money can remedy. For my own share I find that the thought of my having got day&#x2019;s wages for my labour will give a new face to the whole matter: what more do I ever expect (so often not finding it) but day&#x2019;s wages for my work? It is likely enough this may prove the only portion of the Book I may ever get so much for. I can attack the thing again, with unabated cheerfulness; and certainly, one may hope do it better and not worse.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-72" n="08:72"/>For you again, the smart of having in so simple a way, forfeited so much money (which you also had to work for) may well burn out the other smart; and so, the precious feeling of a satisfied conscience succeeding to great pain, the whole business be healed, and even made <hi rend="italic">wholer</hi> than ever. Let us believe firmly that, to those who take them wisely, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things whatsoever are <hi rend="italic">good</hi>.</p>
<p>I am to be out tonight, at tea with Allan Cunningham. The following nights we are at home: on Thursday night, I could even hope to give you the completed <hi rend="italic">F&#xEA;te des Piques</hi> [Feast of Pikes] (if I get on well),&#x2014;provided you <hi rend="italic">durst</hi> take it: with me it were no daring; for I think of all men living you are henceforth the least likely to commit such an oversight again. I mean also by the first good opportunity to let you see a little farther into my actual economic position here than you have yet done: these confusions, I feel, have thrown us still closer together than we were; and I hope in that sense too will be blessed.</p>
<p>One thing I forgot to mention on Saturday: that we will not <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> of the misfortune, to any new unconcerned person; at least not till it is made good again, or made better. I had to impart it in general terms to the Bookseller Fraser, but only in general; as &#x201C;an accident&#x201D; chargeable on no one; and he has promised me to maintain perfect silence. My Brother John and my Mother must know of it; but no other has right to do so.</p>
<p>Among the Books needful one of the needfullest, as I now bethink me, is on your own shelves: Condorcet&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Turgot</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas, Marquis de Condorcet, <hi rend="italic">Vie de Monsieur Turgot</hi> (London, <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>).</note> Pray bring it in your pocket. I will also have de Stael&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Considerations;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baroness Anne-Louise Germaine de Sta&#xEB;l Holstein, <hi rend="italic">Consid&#xE9;rations sur les principaux &#xE9;v&#xE9;nemens de la R&#xE9;volution Fran&#x26;ccedil;aise</hi>, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>).</note> but this I think I can procure perhaps more readily than you.&#x2014; The thing must be made <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than it was, or we shall never be able, not to forget it, but to laugh victorious in remembering it.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>If it is tomorrow-<hi rend="italic">night</hi>, we are unluckily to be out: to see Wordsworth at Taylor&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Henry Taylor&#x2019;s. For the meeting with Wordsworth see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350323-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-03-23">23 March</date></ref>.</note> which otherwise were not unlucky. After that, to be at home indefinitely.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No doubt Mill meant to see Carlyle to work out the details of their financial arrangement. On <date when="1835-03-10">10 March</date> Mill had written to him: &#x201C;Nothing which could have happened, could have been at this time so great a good to me as your note, received this morning. &#x2026; I never before felt so fully the whole amount of the good of having somewhat more than one actually needs for urgent wants. That which can buy peace of conscience is precious. &#xb6;You shall see or hear from me again almost immediately&#x2014;but I will not take the <hi rend="italic">F&#xEA;te de Piques</hi>&#x2014;not that I believe that such a thing could possibly happen again, but for the sake of retributive justice I would wear the badge of my untrustworthiness. If however you would give me the pleasure of reading it give it to Mrs Taylor&#x2014;in her custody no harm could come to it&#x2014;and I can read it aloud to her as I did much of the other&#x2014;for it had not only the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> reader you mention but a second as good.&#x201D; But Carlyle did not give Mrs. Taylor the chance to read the &#x201C;F&#xEA;te de Piques,&#x201D; and Mill read no more of Carlyle&#x2019;s manuscript.</note></p>
<p>Thanks for your brave cargoes of Books. If I do not manage well, no man can say it was for the want of encouragement. One mysterious <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle</hi> (said to be from Fraser, tho&#x2019; I countermanded <hi rend="italic">him</hi>,&#x2014;perhaps too late) has arrived: happily as yet only one. I have got Bookshelves; made better arrangements; hope to get along better. The <hi rend="italic">Federation</hi> was finished yesterday. Tonight I am for <hi rend="italic">Turgot</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (<date when="1727-00-00">1727</date>&#x2013;<date when="1781-00-00">81</date>), statesman. Carlyle was preparing the ground again for the beginning of volume I. Turgot appears in Book II (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, II, 30 ff.).</note></p>
<p>If you be about the Athenaeum, or otherwise among Hon. Members, my Dame begs you to get that frank for her Mother.</p>
<p>By the way, there is no answer from Glasgow; and now I think the thing had winded itself up satisfactorily without answer. There came here above a week ago one of the hirsutest Scotch Radicals going; one Weir, able Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Argus</hi> (once an Advocate in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>): from him, questioned in a distant way, I learned that the so-called Educational Society was a miserable Kirk-Session affair (propatronage, or antipatronage), and of a &#x201C;heaven no bigger than three ells.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> Fancy the shock that such a com<hi rend="italic">e</hi>tose body (franked by <pb id="pg-08-74" n="08:74"/>Roebuck too) must have given there!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Com<hi rend="italic">e</hi>tose&#x201D; is evidently a humorous misusage or private joke; Carlyle&#x2019;s application to the Glasgow Educational Society had evidently been franked by the radical Roebuck.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Aus dem wird Nichts</hi></foreign> [Out of this comes nothing].</p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>You are right in this matter, and yet also wrong; and have sent me just <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> the sum due. By the correctest computation I can institute, I find the writing of that thing to have cost me in money-wages not &#xa3;200 but &#xa3;100: more than the latter sum, accepted on such grounds, were a <hi rend="italic">defrauding of the revenue</hi>. It was among the <hi rend="italic">slowest</hi> feats of writing I ever executed; and tho&#x2019; the rewriting of it is new and very singular work (for I have been at it these two days), it surely cannot prove slower.</p>
<p>Will you therefore cancel this little Document, and make out another for half the amount.</p>
<p>One hundred Pounds thrown away as in a whiff of smoke is damage enough! It is a distracted wasteful world,&#x2014;where the Devil is busy.&#x2014; But we are not to speak of it, till the whole is made good again.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle found it hard to return to writing, and records in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<date when="1835-03-17">17 March</date>): &#x201C;Have been two days at that <hi rend="italic">Death of Louis XV</hi> again, which threatens much not to prosper with me. &#x2026; Mill passionately entreated to pay me day&#x2019;s wages for my toil; I without difficulty consented: nay it seemed to me at first as if the fact of getting wages would be a complete consolation. Alas it proves not so. &#x2026; Yesterday Mill accordingly sent me a draught for &#xa3;200: I had already computed that my expenditure during the time spent writing that piece was not above &#xa3;100; whereupon I have returned Mill&#x2019;s draught and directed him to make me another of half the amount. And so in some handsome manner <hi rend="italic">this</hi> part of it will be winded up.&#x201D; When he came to write the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> he noted: &#x201C;Wish I could find a way of getting the now much macerated, changed and fanaticised &#x2018;John Stuart Mill&#x2019; to take that &#xa3;100 back; but I fear there is no way!&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> came in this morning (after 16 days from Rome); and, tomorrow being post-day, I have shoved my writing-table into the corner, and sit (with my back to the fire and Jane, who is busy sewing at my old jupe of a Dressing-gown) forthwith making answer. It was somewhat longed for; yet I felt, in other respects, that it was better you had not written sooner; for I had a thing to dilate upon, of a most ravelled character, that was better to be knit up a little first.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, II, ii.</note> You shall hear. But do not be alarmed; for it is &#x201C;neither death nor men&#x2019;s lives&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Rom. 8:38.</note> we are all well, and I heard out of Annandale within these three weeks, nay Jane&#x2019;s Newspaper came with the customary &#x201C;two strokes,&#x201D; only five days ago. I meant to write to our Mother last night; but shall now do it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Mill had borrowed that first Volume of my poor <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> (pieces of it more than <hi rend="italic">once</hi>) that he might have it all before him, and write down some observations on it, which perhaps I might print as Notes. I was busy meanwhile with Volume Second; toiling along like a <hi rend="italic">Nigger</hi>, but with the heart of a free Roman: indeed, I know not how it was, I had not felt so clear and independent, sure of myself and of my task for many long years. Well, one night about three weeks ago,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1835-03-06">6 March</date>.</note> we sat at tea, and Mill&#x2019;s short rap was heard at the door. Jane rose to welcome him; but he stood there unresponsive, pale, the very picture of despair; said, half articulately gasping, that she must go down and speak to &#x201C;Mrs Taylor&#x201D; (his Platonic <foreign>inamorata</foreign>); with whom Jane fancied he must have at length <hi rend="italic">run off</hi>, and so was come, before setting out for the Devil, to take solemn <pb id="pg-08-76" n="08:76"/>leave of us. Happily, no;&#x2014;and yet unhappily!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton omits from &#x201C;(his Platonic <foreign>inamorata</foreign>&#x201D; to this point.</note> After some considerable additional gasping, I learned from Mill this fact: that my poor Manuscript, all except some four tattered leaves, was <hi rend="italic">annihilated!</hi> He had left it out (too carelessly); it had been taken for wastepaper: and so five months of as tough labour as I could remember of, were as good as vanished, gone like a whiff of smoke.&#x2014; There never in my life had come upon me any other <hi rend="italic">accident</hi> of much moment; but this I could not but feel to be a sore one. The thing was <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>, and perhaps worse; for I had not only forgotten all the structure of it, but the spirit it was written with was past; only the general impression seemed to remain, and the recollection that I was on the whole well satisfied with that, and could now hardly hope to equal it. Mill whom I had to comfort and speak peace to remained injudiciously enough till almost midnight, and my poor Dame and I had to sit talking of indifferent matters; and could not till then get our lament freely uttered. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> was very good to me; and the thing did not beat us. I felt in general that I was as a little Schoolboy, who had laboriously written out his <hi rend="italic">Copy</hi> as he could, and was shewing it not without satisfaction to the Master: but lo! the Master had suddenly torn it, saying: &#x201C;No, boy, thou must go and write it <hi rend="italic">better</hi>.&#x201D; What could I do but sorrowing go and try to obey. That night was a hard one; something from time to time tying me tight as it were all round the region of the heart, and strange dreams haunting me: however, I was not without good thoughts too that came like healing life into me; and I got it somewhat reasonably crushed down, not abolished, yet subjected to me with the resolution and prophecy of abolishing. Next morning accordingly I wrote to Fraser (who had <hi rend="italic">advertised</hi> the Book as &#x201C;preparing for publication&#x201D;) that it was all gone back; that he must not <hi rend="italic">speak of it</hi> to any one (till it was made good again); finally that he must send me some <hi rend="italic">better paper</hi>, and also a <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle</hi>, for I was determined to risk ten pounds more upon it. Poor Fraser was very assiduous: I got Bookshelves put up (for the whole House was <hi rend="italic">flowing</hi> with Books), where the <hi rend="italic">Biographie</hi> (not Fraser&#x2019;s, however, who was countermanded, but Mill&#x2019;s), with much else stands all ready, much readier than before: and so, having first finished out the Piece I was actually upon, I began <hi rend="italic">again</hi> at the beginning. Early the day after tomorrow (after a hard and quite novel kind of battle) I count on having the First Chapter on paper a second time, no worse than it was, tho&#x2019; considerably different. The bitterness of the business is <pb id="pg-08-77" n="08:77"/>past therefore; and you must conceive me toiling along in that new way for many weeks to come. As for Mill I must yet tell you the best side of him. Next day after the accident he writes me a passionate Letter requesting with boundless earnestness to be allowed to make the loss good as far as <hi rend="italic">money</hi> was concerned in it. I answered: Yes, since he so desired it; for in our circumstances it was not unreasonable: in about a week he accordingly transmits me a draft for &#xa3;200; I had computed that my five month&#x2019;s housekeeping &#x26;c had cost me &#xa3;100; which sum therefore and not two hundred was the one, I told him, I could take. He has been here since then; but has not sent the &#xa3;100, tho&#x2019; I suppose he will soon do it, and so the thing will end,&#x2014;more handsomely than one could have expected. I ought to draw from it various practical &#x201C;uses of improvement&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a religious term of the &#x201C;improving&#x201D; kind.</note> (among others not to lend manuscripts again); and above all things try to do the work <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than it was; in which case I shall never grudge the labour, but reckon it a goodhap.&#x2014; It really seemed to me a Book of considerable significance; and not unlikely even to be of some interest at present: but that latter, and indeed all economical and other the like considerations had become profoundly indifferent to me; I felt that I was honestly writing down and delineating a World-Fact (which the Almighty had brought to pass in the world); that it was an <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> work for me, and all men might do or say of it simply what seemed good to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>.&#x2014; Nay I have got back my spirits again (after this first Chapter), and hope I shall go on tolerably. I will struggle assiduously to be done with it by the time you are to be looked for (which meeting may God bring happily to pass); and in that case I will cheerfully throw the business down a while, and walk off with you to Scotland hoping to be ready for the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> publishing season.&#x2014; This is my ravelled concern, dear Jack; which you see is in the way to knit itself up again, before I am called to tell you of it. And now for something else. I was for writing to you of it next day after it happened: but Jane suggested it would only grieve you, till I could say it was in the way towards adjustment; which counsel I saw to be right. Let us hope assuredly that the whole will be for <hi rend="italic">good</hi>.</p>
<p>I told you there had been a Letter from Dumfriesshire. Mrs Welsh writes to us oftener, with full news of everything (our Mother <hi rend="italic">was</hi> at Templand, did I tell you?): but she<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Welsh.</note> is still in Edinburgh, tho&#x2019; soon returning now. Alick on this occasion was the correspondent: I had <pb id="pg-08-78" n="08:78"/>written to him just three days before, so that his Letter would be put into the Post Office and mine taken <hi rend="italic">out</hi> by the same messenger; I wrote again very soon after. He has actually done with Catlinns. It was let by auction on the day advertised; to somebody for &#xa3;12 less than his rent: that somebody I suppose is <foreign><hi rend="italic">glarring</hi></foreign> [wading in the mud] and ploughing over it (poor fellow) in these very days; and Alick marches at Whitsunday <hi rend="italic">first</hi>. He wanted much to have counsel: I could give him little except in general; farming seemed to me also a thing he was probably as well done with; Annan and some kind of graindealing there looked the likeliest. It seems to me not improbable that he will try himself there: he was to see Ben Nelson<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210109-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:304</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-09">9 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> about it, he said; his tone of temper was good; cheerful, and <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> to have another fly at it. He will perhaps find himself much better situated in that way of life; there is better society to be had there; more of interest; a freer field in several respects. He seemed very grateful for your Letter; charged me to send you his thanks over and over again. I hope we shall see him in Summer, doing better.&#x2014; Our good Mother added a little postscript; in the same meek cheery temper they are all in: Jean was to get her some ruled paper at Dumfries; with the aid of which she might really write a very reasonable Letter.&#x2014; I get a daily <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> Newspaper from Mill (he leaves it in masses, every two or three days, at a shop in Knightsbridge): copies of this I circulate among them far and wide: one or two weekly to my Mother; who also pretty regularly gets the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, furnished me by Hunt (whom for the rest I do not <hi rend="italic">see</hi> once in the month), tho&#x2019; I myself sometimes <hi rend="italic">omit</hi> to send it. The aspect of Politics seems to me the wretchedest; and happily there are several people here who never open their mouths on that subject. I have sent a Newspaper or two to poor Johnston at Haddington; to Arbuckle, to Glen,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston, Dr. Robert Arbuckle, and William Glen.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c. There is little other good in them: only we felt rather ashamed that Whiggism was all out a week before we knew it, down here in our village stilness!&#x2014; Peel apparently will be out soon too:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peel had been unable to secure a majority in the <date when="1835-01-00">January</date> elections, and was about to be forced out on the question of the Irish Church; so the Tory ministry, under the leadership of Peel and Wellington, was dissolved on <date when="1835-04-08">8 April</date>. A new ministry, under the Whig Lord Melbourne, was formed on <date when="1835-04-18">18 April</date>.</note> and then? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Des Sottises</hi></foreign> [some stupidities]!</p>
<p>Your practice at Rome is literally of the profitableness that all good work is of: for this world, Nothing. Never mind, my boy; take more <pb id="pg-08-79" n="08:79"/>of it, if it offer; a nervous Dowager is one of God&#x2019;s creatures too; and worth relieving if one can do it. The shabbiness of taking a man&#x2019;s time and labour from him for nothing is great but I fear, not unexampled. These people in all ways are seeking <hi rend="italic">another</hi> than wisdom, and will find it. As for your place with the Countess I very much incline to think with you that after September you should be <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> to deal with as to any new engagement there. Subsistence for some years you have laid up: free toil, if it brought only a morsel of bread, were <hi rend="italic">more</hi> blessed; and one thing is always true, there <hi rend="italic">are</hi> more sick. Decide on nothing however; but keep yourself busy inquiring, preparing to decide. I believe Doctorship here to be at as miserable a pass as well could be: &#x201C;Homoeopathy&#x201D; the ready road to fortune in it; <hi rend="italic">quackery</hi> as from old abounding. There are two grand Homoeopathists I find: Doctor Quin,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Hervey Quin (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>), first homeopathic physician in England; M.D. Edinburgh University, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>; converted to a belief in homeopathic medicine during practice in Naples, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>; founded Hom&#x9c;opathic Society, <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>. A noted wit, he was socially popular, and counted Dickens, Thackeray, Bulwer, Macready, etc., among his friends.</note> and Doctor Bel&#x2019;uomo (Beautiful Man!) an Italian.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Giuseppe Belluomini (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>) was trained in medicine in Pisa and Vienna. He had a diplomatic and political career in the Republic of Lucca from <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date> to <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date> when he was exiled from Vienna.

<p>There has no answer come from the Glasgow people: on this good ground, that they have none to send. They are a <hi rend="italic">chimera</hi>, or nearly so. Weir (once of Edinburgh, now able Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Argus</hi>) was here lately, and I inquired about them: Collins the Chalmerian Bookseller<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Collins; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240720-TC-MAC-01"><sic>3:111</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1824-07-20">20 July 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> and such like, with views of putting down the Voluntary Church Association, or some despicability of that kind; a Letter from <pb id="pg-08-80" n="08:80"/>me must have gone to their heart like a knife. The Government will perhaps one day need such a person; in which case I will actually try: Mill thought it not unreasonable the other night.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Glasgow Association see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref>; for ideas discussed with Mill see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350203-TC-NE-01">&#x201C;National Education&#x201D; [ca. <date when="1835-02-03">3 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> But for the present I have work, work!&#x2014; Our visitors and visitings are what I cannot give you account of this time: not that they are many; but that the sheet is so near full. One Taylor (Henry Taylor, who has written a <hi rend="italic">Philip van Artevelde</hi>, a good man, whose <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi> reminds me of poor Irving&#x2019;s) invited me to meet Southey some weeks ago. I went and met Southey. A man of clear brown complexion, large nose, <hi rend="italic">no</hi> chin, or next to none; care-lined and thought-lined brow, vehement hazel eyes; huge mass of white hair surmounting it: a strait-laced, limited, well-instructed, well-conditioned, excessively sensitive even irritable-looking man. His irritability I think is his grand spiritual feature; as his grand bodily is perhaps leanness and long legs: a nervous female might shriek when he rises for the first time, and stretches to such unexpected length&#x2014;like a lean pair of tongs! We parted good friends; and may meet again, or not meet, as Destiny orders. At the same house since that Jane and I went to meet Wordsworth.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 299, Carlyle says that he did not have any &#x201C;decisive meeting&#x201D; with Wordsworth until <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, but that he &#x201C;may have seen him before&#x201D; at Taylor&#x2019;s; but Norton notes there that Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> for <date when="1836-06-01">1 June 1836</date> records &#x201C;seen Wordsworth again.&#x201D; Yet the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> shows that Carlyle not only met Wordsworth at the present time, but that he observed him closely: &#x201C;An old very loquacious, indeed quite prosing man; with a tint of naturalness, of sincere insight nevertheless. He has been much spoiled: King of his company; unrecognised and then adulated &#x26;c &#x26;c; worth little now. A genuine kind of man, but intrinsically and extrinsically a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> one, let them sing or say what they will. I rather think he loves hardly anything, but himself and his own reputation. The languid way in which he gives you a handful of numb unresponsive fingers, is very significant. It seems also rather to grieve him that you have any admiration for any body (but him). &#x2026; His wife is the oldest looking woman I ever saw; winking, withered, sleepy-fidgetting, as if she were all dried to a <hi rend="italic">Kipper</hi> without and within. A silly woman (probably) from the first. <hi rend="italic">Mem</hi>. It was at Henry Taylor&#x2019;s.&#x201D; Evidently Carlyle did not refer back to the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, on this occasion, when writing the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, but confused his memories of this meeting with later meetings, since he repeats the substance of what he noted about Wordsworth&#x2019;s egotism and of Mrs. Wordsworth (which Taylor told Norton was probably a case of mistaken identity).</note> I did not expect much; but got mostly what I expected. The old man has a fine shrewdness and naturalness in his expression of face (a long Cumberland figure); one finds also a kind of <hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi> in his speech: but for prolixity, thinness, endless dilution it excels all the other speech I had heard from mortal. A genuine man (which is much) but also essentially a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> genuine man: nothing perhaps is <pb id="pg-08-81" n="08:81"/>sadder (of the glad kind) than the <hi rend="italic">unbounded</hi> laudation of such a man; sad proof of the <hi rend="italic">rarity</hi> of such. I fancy however he has fallen into the garrulity of age, and is not what he was: also that his environment (and rural Prophethood) has hurt him much. He seems impatient that even Shakspear should be admired: &#x201C;so much out of my own pocket&#x201D;! The shake of hand he gives you is <foreign>feckless</foreign>, egoistical; I rather fancy he <hi rend="italic">loves</hi> nothing in the world so much as one could wish. When I compare that man with a great man,&#x2014;alas, he is like dwindling into a contemptibility. Jean Paul (for example), neither was he <hi rend="italic">great</hi>, could have worn him as a finger-ring. However, when &#x201C;I go to Cumberland,&#x201D; Wordsworth will still be a glad sight.&#x2014; I have not been fortunate in my Pen tonight; indeed for the last page, I have been writing with the back of it. This and my speed will account for the confusion. Porridge has just come in. I will to bed without writing more; and finish tomorrow.

I will now walk with this up to Charing Cross after dinner; which will still do.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I purposed writing to you two nights ago, as you might perhaps notice on the Newspaper; but a little man came in, and occupied the whole evening I designed for you. It turned out, however, to be &#x201C;probably just as well&#x201D;: for next day there arrived Jack&#x2019;s Roman <pb id="pg-08-83" n="08:83"/>Letter; which now can go along with mine to make the bargain better. We are, as Jack says, very lucky; and should be thankful that we hear from one another so regularly. I will only wish now, since <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have delayed so long, that our Letters may not again <hi rend="italic">run into one another&#x2019;s mouth:</hi> however, in that case too, I will send you an answer the sooner, and make matters straight again.</p>
<p>Jack, as you will see, has nothing but good news for us: the best is that he is (we can hope) on the way to see us all again, &#x201C;by the end of <date when="1835-06-00">June</date>.&#x201D; I answered him last night;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Begun <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350323-TC-JAC-01"><date when="1835-03-23">23</date>, finished <date when="1835-03-24">24 March</date></ref>.</note> and could not but, among other things, agree with him that it were as well if his Travels ceased after that: he will have funds for attempting a settlement somewhere; and, if he see any feasibility, ought to do it. The money he speaks of will be sent forward as the last was; I will give you notice of it, and you will have to go to Dumfries; which, if Harry be in any condition, will perhaps do you no harm. As for that question about whether you got the <hi rend="italic">annual</hi> (or interest) regularly, I could make no answer; but hope you do. If you do not, pray apply, and make the people pay up. I never learned either whether the Houses at Ecclefechan were got satisfactorily repaired, or how the rents come in: you complain of nothing; but have doubtless complaints that you <hi rend="italic">might</hi> make;&#x2014;and which I ought to know of. In the meanwhile, dear Mother, what a satisfaction for me is it to know that you are one of those that look not either to Houses in Ecclefechan, or any House or Possession on this poor Earth for your comfort and stronghold! I know well that there is nothing but <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a faith that can render this Earth and her stinted allowances endurable, nay matters of thankfulness for one. The cheerful wise way in which you adjust yourself to so many vicissitudes, and are always seen to be yourself in the midst of them, should be a lesson to me and all of us.</p>
<p>I had some occasion lately for a portion of your faith; in a most unexpected <hi rend="italic">accident</hi> (what we call <hi rend="italic">accident</hi>) that befel me; of which I delayed writing till I could not only say that I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> get over it, but that I had got over it. Be of good cheer, therefore, as to that: it is all right (and for the best, I am persuaded); and you shall now hear about it fully. To sum up all in a word: the <hi rend="italic">First Volume</hi> of my poor Book is utterly destroyed! Mill, to whom I had lent it to read, and write Notes on (for he is skilled in that subject), and who was full of admiration for the bit of work, had left it carelessly out in his house: some of the people saw it lying; tore it up as waste paper; <pb id="pg-08-84" n="08:84"/>and when he noticed it, there were only some three or four fractions of leaves remaining. He came hither to me, in a state looking not unlike insanity; and gasped out (for he could hardly speak) his Job&#x2019;s-news. I am very glad that I got it borne so well; for it was a hard thing. It never got the better of me; and by next morning the bitterness of it was all over; and I had determined that there must be a finger of Providence in it; that it meant simply I was to write the thing over again <hi rend="italic">truer</hi> than it was. My little Dame stood faithfully by me too, and was very good and brave. Having finished out the new Chapter I was upon therefore, I resolutely turned back to the beginning again; and have this day finished the First Chapter of all a second time, certainly no <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than it was; a thing that gives me great comfort, for I now find that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do it; of which, before trial (so <hi rend="italic">irksome</hi> was the business), I had no certainty, except in the determination to &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">gar</hi></foreign> [make] myself do it.&#x201D; &#x201C;Dinna <foreign>tine</foreign> [lose] heart, therefore; if thou <foreign>tine</foreign> heart, thou <foreign>tines</foreign> a&#x2019;!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340530-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:195</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-30">30 May 1834</date></corr></ref></note> I do really believe the Book will be the better for it, and we shall all be the better.&#x2014; I must not forget to say that poor Mill next day sent a passionate entreaty to be allowed to pay me, what money could pay; to which I, as to a reasonable thing, acceded; and so he sent me soon after a Draught for &#xa3;200,&#x2014;which however I returned that same day saying it was just <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> the sum due. I have seen Mill since, and we talked of it; he this day sends me another Letter still wishing I would stand by the original sum or some intermediate one: but I had explained to him that &#xa3;100 was fully my expenses during the time of writing the thing; and so I fancy we will still adhere to that computation; for if any one had asked me to throw the writing into the fire, and said, What would I take? I could have given him no definite answer&#x2014;except that I would be <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>, ill <hi rend="italic">indeed</hi> to deal with. In this rather handsome way, has the matter been brought to a bearing. One other thing I proposed that it should never <hi rend="italic">be spoken of</hi> (except to you and Jack and the Kindred) till it was all made good again.</p>
<p>So that you see, dear Mother, I have no chance to <hi rend="italic">earn</hi> my Dressing-gown this Summer: but you will give it me on trust I daresay? My whole object now is to get the lost part made up again by the time Jack may be expected: I will then throw it by for a while, and take it up afterwards; perhaps write some part of it beside <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. It really was going to be what I reckoned a reasonably good Book (and a Part of it I still have); neither will it, one may think, the <pb id="pg-08-85" n="08:85"/><hi rend="italic">rebellious heart</hi> being once subdued to work quietly at it, be <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than it was; but <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, for I know it better. You cannot think what a comfort the feeling that I am doing an honest work in God&#x2019;s Creation, whether I be ever paid for it or not, gives me: I have not been as contented for many years. The great uproar of London is a great beautiful moving Picture for me: I say to it, with the greatest good-nature, &#x201C;Go thou thy way, I am going mine.&#x201D; There is no blessedness in the world equal to that.</p>
<p>Besides, I ought to say, we are not ill off, or ill used in any way, but really <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. I suppose we have a little circle of society here, considerably better than his Majesty&#x2019;s, or his Grace of Wellington&#x2019;s; for it consists of really superior honest-minded men and women (most rare, as the world goes); and the respect we are held in there could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be procured by running the brightest Gig in nature, or spending daily &#x201C;a Mill and a Mains.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The value of a small estate.</note> One ought to be really glad of <hi rend="italic">this;</hi>&#x2014;but glad above all things that one <hi rend="italic">could do without it too</hi>. &#x201C;Mind thy own Trade!&#x201D; That is the great secret: the others can &#x201C;di&#x2019;tha naither ill na guid.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:50</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; When we meet (as I trust the good Providence will permit) I will tell you all about our people: we have made acquaintance with a very excellent woman, since I wrote; a Miss Fenwick (from the North Country, Durham or Northumberland originally); an oldish woman, with a deformity in the Spine, but otherwise really rather good-looking; I often say that she is the wisest person male or female I have fallen in with in London: I am very sorry that she is but a kind of visitor here (in the house of one Henry Taylor, also a very worthy person), and is going off to Devonshire or some whither in <date when="1835-04-00">April</date>. At that house, Jane and I lately saw Wordsworth; reputed the greatest Literary character at present in England: a good kind of man; but &#x201C;alas, gudewife, nothing <hi rend="italic">but a fluff o&#x2019; feathers</hi>&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;An eccentric old minister in Dumfries, buying a live fowl, weighed it in his hand, and used this expression&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;when you come to <hi rend="italic">weigh</hi> him! We were very glad, however, if not to see him, yet to <hi rend="italic">have seen</hi> him; and so returned content.&#x2014; But in truth, we have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> much society; very nearly I think what is about the right stock. Night after night we can sit here quite still, over our Books or Papers, and find it a not unprofitable night; and then when a rap comes, one can with the better conscience prepare to welcome it. Besides at any time one can <hi rend="italic">go</hi> out and see somebody. It is very different from Puttoch; which indeed I never think of without feeling that we did well to <pb id="pg-08-86" n="08:86"/>leave it.&#x2014; For the rest, you must not think, dear Mother, that I am overworking myself: I assure you, no; I walk as regularly as possible, disregarding the foul weather, and all the rest of it: the birds are singing in the Parks, or I have people to call on; it is all very pleasant even if one do nothing but look at it. My health is surely not worse than it was but better.</p>
<p>This afternoon I went to Charing-Cross Post-office (which keeps longer open) with Jack&#x2019;s Letter: whom should I meet tripping along in Pall Mall? My Lord Jeffrey; just arrived two hours ago! I was heartily glad to see the little man; gladder I think than he to see me (for that Astronomy Professorship sticks with <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, not me): however, he got my card, and will be down before returning Northward to his Judgeship again. He was looking grey and dusty: &#x201C;ye may depend on&#x2019;t,&#x201D; as an old Roxburghshire woman said, &#x201C;forty years maks a great odds of <hi rend="italic">a girl</hi>,&#x201D;&#x2014;or boy either.&#x2014; Another still queerer fellow I saw not long ago in Hyde Park. It was a bright day, and the quality were all out driving and coursing; as I came down thro&#x2019; the thing, one figure struck me: a lean rib of a creature buttoned in white great coat, his head and even his hat <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> within the collar of it (which stood out a foot or more from his neck); eyes winking, under-jaw projected, whole face puckered into wrinkles; the whole going on at a kind of ineffectual high-trot: it was &#x201C;our ain Hoddam, Sir&#x201D;; General Sharpe Member for those Burghs! I actually burst into laughing, tho&#x2019; grave enough before.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For General Matthew Sharpe, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210324-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:346</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-03-24">24 March 1821</date></corr></ref>. &#x201C;The minister of Hoddam, out catechising, asked a boy, &#x2018;Who was the first man?&#x2019; and received an unhesitating reply, &#x2018;Our ain <hi rend="italic">Hoddam</hi>, Sir!&#x2019; (meaning the <foreign>Laird</foreign> of Hoddam, General Sharpe. &#x2026;)&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note></p>
<p>Alas, my dear Mother, the Paper is done; and this wretched Pen has been so thriftless!&#x2014; I wrote to Alick; Jamie would get a Note, and for you only a piece of paper. I long to hear what Alick is deciding on. Tell him to keep up his heart; for better days are coming: also to write to me by his earliest convenience, whether he have decided or not. My love to Jean, Mary, to Jenny whom I fancy still with you. Have you got the ruled paper? I did expect a Letter; and of course now do more than ever. Tell me all that you are doing: how you stand this wild Spring weather. I have nothing for it but to believe in Jean&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi>, which are most welcome weekly. If your weather is no better than ours, the ploughers must be at a bad pass: everything is drenched here (only our subsoil is all <hi rend="italic">sand</hi>); and March <hi rend="italic">dust</hi> is none, only March <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud] what you like. It is among the rainiest springs <pb id="pg-08-87" n="08:87"/>I remember. Do you care about the <hi rend="italic">Globes?</hi> I can easily send you a better share of them; but I doubt whether you would get them oftener than weekly, and then they are so old. Charlie Buller often writes the <hi rend="italic">big print</hi> part: all that has any <hi rend="italic">fun</hi> in it is by him. It is thought these poor Ministers will soon be thrown out; a thing which I for one neither pray much for nor against.

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>That day at the India House I meant to settle with you about our little cash account, had not Sterling come in: yesterday I ought to have written; but was sickly, <hi rend="italic">busy</hi> and incapable of being busy.</p>
<p>I am very loath to decline anything that would gratify you: but I find on the whole, and with all anxiety to avoid anything <hi rend="italic">superfine</hi> in the matter, that I must abide by the original scheme. It is definite, gives me no doubt or reluctance; all beyond that is vague, <hi rend="italic">in</hi>calculable, and hovers upon regions one would not wish to have any trade in. By <hi rend="italic">it</hi> not only is the burden <hi rend="italic">equalized</hi> among us, but diminished in absolute quantity; by the other scheme <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would have a heavier share of it, but the whole were augmented rather, and my share not lightened. Let us be content then with the best we can do.</p>
<p>We are to be out on Sunday night and Tuesday night; not otherwise that I know of.</p>
<p>I have seen Wordsworth again, and find my former interpretation of him strengthened. He seems to me a most <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> man (a mighty point in these days); and flows on there, delivering what is really in him, platitudes or wisdoms as the case may be. A really <hi rend="italic">earth</hi>born <pb id="pg-08-88" n="08:88"/><hi rend="italic">well</hi>, not an artificial <foreign><hi rend="italic">jet d&#x2019;eau</hi></foreign> [fountain]: let us be satisfied with the &#x201C;day of small things.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Zech. 4:10.</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1835-04-04">4 April</date>. Jean reported two recent births in the family: James Carlyle was now father of another James, and Alick had a daughter Margaret. She added that the two sisters of her husband, James Aitken, had been married recently: Mary to Rob Green and Jennie to &#x201C;a young man of the name Dickie from Mouswald.&#x201D; She also said, &#x201C;What a strange piece of ill luck the destruction [&#x201C;burning&#x201D; has been deleted] of the volume I hope you will not run yourself too far on in the season before you make out your journeys.&#x201D; No doubt she had heard the news from her mother.</note> arrived the day before yesterday; and today comes the Newspaper, with James&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi>, always welcome. There is a frank going off to Mrs Welsh, which will carry so light a sheet as this: so I, having <hi rend="italic">slurred-over</hi> rather than done my day&#x2019;s task, will answer you; preferring that to my due daily walk;&#x2014;for indeed I have to walk some five miles into the Town, to Tea, this evening, at any rate; and that ought to suffice. You shall hear what I on the spur of the moment can tell you; and in the first place that all goes in the old way &#x201C;tolerably well,&#x201D; which we ought rather to account &#x201C;very well,&#x201D; as the world wags now.</p>
<p>There is none of my Scotch Correspondents that gives me so authentic a picture of things as you do; wherein I can see the <hi rend="italic">wrong-side</hi> too, with its seams and <foreign>thrums</foreign> [tangled threads] (as every earthly thing has a wrong-side), and know that it is all authentic. If you wrote a smaller hand and wrote oftener, I should have no quarrel with you. Our dear Mother seems to be going on in moderate health at least, and moderately well every way: I hope <supplied>[to]</supplied> see more minutely <hi rend="italic">how</hi>, in the course of this present summer. What Jenny and she <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, or how they get along in that new Scotsbrig world, I still very imperfectly make out. The &#x201C;new relatives,&#x201D; poor little things, are right welcome into this evil Earth: may they find it a place if not to be at ease in, to be busy in <hi rend="italic">wisely!</hi> That is always possible for all men. I can see &#x201C;James of Scotsbrig&#x201D; tolerably from what you say; and reckon <pb id="pg-08-90" n="08:90"/>that the Opposition Parties are arranged there on the <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> footing.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had described some friction in the family centered on James (married to Isabella) with whom Carlyle&#x2019;s mother and sister Janet were living at Scotsbrig: &#x201C;Isabella and them seem to do quite well; they seem to say that Jamie has <hi rend="italic">gone over to the other side of the house</hi> . . &#x2026; anything that miscarries with Alick or any of us he counts simply want of proper management, this is particularly offencive for Alick.&#x201D;</note> So Alick has about engaged with the Howes!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350227-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1835-02-27">27 Feb.</date></ref></note> I do fancy it may be the best thing he could do. He must write to me soon, and tell me how it is arranged. Say to him from me that all will yet be well; that the faithful man was <hi rend="italic">never</hi> yet beaten; if he stand to himself the Heavens stand by him; the troubles they afflict him with are actually but <hi rend="italic">trials</hi>, to try what stuff is in him, and bring it out.</p>
<p>Of James and you nothing but good accounts come to me. Know this always, my dear friends, for a very truth, even as it stands written in your Bible: &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">fear of God</hi> is the beginning of wisdom.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 111:10.</note> Let a man reverence that Unseen Highest; feel that &#x201C;he is ever in the eye of his Great Taskmaster,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milton&#x2019;s sonnet, &#x201C;How soon hath Time.&#x201D;</note> and it shall be well with him.&#x2014; You are perhaps no worse for the present that you have little society; unless your neighbours can teach you something, or strengthen you or be strengthened by you in some useful way, you are as well to let them go their <foreign><hi rend="italic">gates</hi></foreign> [ways], with your good wishes. Have <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to do at any time with malicious, false, idle or god-forgetting people! Good is the company of four bare walls compared with that of these. By degrees, however, you will find more or less of real worth in several that you must be thrown in contact with. One never gets much good of society, or even much favour from it, I think, till once one have learned how easily it can be <hi rend="italic">done without:</hi> as for him that <hi rend="italic">leans</hi> any of his weight on it, he leans on a broken reed. Mind thy work, honest man; and let the world mind <hi rend="italic">its</hi>,&#x2014;or neglect it.&#x2014; I suppose you go into that new house at whitsunday: I shall fancy you as more comfortably situated there. Be &#x201C;busy,&#x201D; whether &#x201C;bare&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had said in her letter that she would be moving, &#x201C;but this house buying will as my mother says keep us &#x2018;bare &#x26; busy&#x2019; for some time to come.&#x201D; Cf. Kelly, <hi rend="italic">Scottish Proverbs</hi>, &#x201C;Ever busy, ever bare.&#x201D;</note> or not; and there is no fear of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Did you send out my Mother the &#x201C;ruled sheets&#x201D;? I rather fancy not; for she has never filled one of them yet.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her next letter, <date when="1835-04-13">13 April</date>, <hi rend="italic">was</hi> on &#x201C;ruled&#x201D; sheets.</note> But indeed perhaps she still expects some notice about Jack&#x2019;s money; of which I have still <pb id="pg-08-91" n="08:91"/>none to send: so soon as I get any, I will put the matter under way, and send word; you will likely get your Visitor then. In the meantime send word that you have heard from me, that we are all well. I fear my Mother is too much vexed about that Manuscript mischance. Tell her, the thing shall be for good: I will actually make it better than it was, if I can; nay I think it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be better, tho&#x2019; I get along very toilsomely. Do not speak of it to any body till I am fairly done; then we will speak. I hope Jack will come safe, in good time, and that I shall be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> when he comes. I never had as long a spell of writing; and could like well enough to take my ease a while: but alas, <foreign>bairn</foreign>, I have &#x201C;the Bastille to take&#x201D; a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> time, so unlucky am I! For the rest, my health &#x26;c is not to be despised. I am never yet in the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> way I used to be in: our water, our climate, all sorts of things are different. The water I fancied at first must have something to do with it; I now find there is &#x201C;epsom salt&#x201D; and other dainties dissolved in all the spring water hereabouts: the river-water carries a solution of dead dogs, <foreign>glar</foreign> (the most infamous): such a thing as a cup of genuine water in this &#x201C;large and populous city&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350130-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-30">30 Jan.</date></ref></note> I have not yet fallen in with. In return we have &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Beea</hi>&#x201D; (Porter, or &#x201C;Heavy wet&#x201D;);<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Beea</hi>,&#x201D; as pronounced in England without the Scots &#x201C;r&#x201D;; &#x201C;heavy wet,&#x201D; slang for dark malt liquor, which porter was.</note> of which Jane drinks one tumbler (value 3 farthings) every day at dinner; I sometimes only, and wish I could do it always. One [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the whole however my health is certainly not <hi rend="italic">worse;</hi> perhaps it is considerably better; nay at times I almost fancy I shall get well again some day!&#x2014; There is one thing James must do for me&#x2014;go and inquire till he satisfy himself about the capabilities of your Dumfries Shoe-last Maker. Can one get a <hi rend="italic">plaster cast</hi> of his foot taken in Dumfries; and will the Lastmaker construct a wooden model in the similitude of that? I am quite serious. For the last fifteen years I have absolutely lost (given away &#x26;c) some considerable proportion of my new shoes (Shaw&#x2019;s last pair, for instance, I wore just one day,&#x2014;with toes bleeding); and nevertheless I find my feet getting more and more lamed, tho&#x2019; perfectly unexceptionable feet; nay I have been hopping about for the last 8 weeks really often in considerable uneasiness with quite a new injury there. Wherefore I have determined one good time for all that I will have a pair of unmistakeable lasts made; actually <hi rend="italic">made</hi>, in the shape of my feet, should I even take a knife and <foreign>whet</foreign> [cut] them out myself. It is a thing sometimes tried here; but by the inquiries I make there seems great danger they might only make you <hi rend="italic">fashionable</hi> lasts, not <pb id="pg-08-92" n="08:92"/><hi rend="italic">fitting</hi> ones; which latter are the kind I want. It is due to Shaw&#x2019;s Lastmaker,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Shaw, Shoemaker, Queensberry St., Dumfries. His lastmaker was apparently Samuel Spence, Boot and Shoe Maker, 23 New Flesh Market St., (JCA to TC, <date when="1835-05-01">1 May</date>).</note> whoever he be, to say that his Lasts are greatly more like a foot than any going here; I think were I beside him, <hi rend="italic">there</hi> were m<supplied>[y]</supplied> best chance. I have tried various places here with my bruised toe; but not succeeded yet: Shaws l<supplied>[ast]</supplied> boots however I can wear with it perfectly easily; and so having thrown away the villainous <supplied>[Cock]</supplied>ney shoes (for they shall never cross my instep again) I can, at worst, hold out till I return. Le<supplied>[t James]</supplied> satisfy himself, and tell me next letter.</p>
<p>There were great quantities of things to write about tea-parties, and societies and people: but the sheet is so near done! A small circle of good people seems to be gathering about us here: we might have a much wider one, if we wanted to get <hi rend="italic">people</hi> merely. We are to lose Mrs Austin: her husband is in perpetual ill-health and depression here; so determines to go to Boulogne in France, where he was once better, and leave all: employment, society, and what not. I feel she will be a loss to us: for herself perhaps it may turn out a gain; she had got to be that unfortunatest thing in nature, a &#x201C;London distinguished female,&#x201D; and this is the handsomest chance she could ever have of walking <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of such froth-element; which otherwise would have <hi rend="italic">cast</hi> her out, when her day came. She is a good woman; and will be far better when she becomes <hi rend="italic">un</hi>distinguished again.&#x2014; My little Lord Jeffrey interrupted me since I began this Letter; coming down to inquire if we were &#x201C;happy.&#x201D; He is here for some weeks, enjoying his vacation: a nimble little individual, whom I wish heartily well to, but have no farther trade with, I apprehend, except in the &#x201C;Fine-day, Sir&#x201D; manner. His ladies are with him; but their way is not our way.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle writes in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<date when="1835-04-10">10 April</date>): &#x201C;Poor little Jeffrey here; trivial, unsatisfactory, not to be heeded, not to be offended at; how happy that I did not let that poor man oblige me! None but my poor Jack is worthy to stand in such relation to me.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; Allan Cunningham&#x2019;s Brother was here last night: he wrote a Book about New South Wales; is a most modest, intelligent man, with much simplicity and a kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">blateness</hi></foreign> [bashfulness]; we gave him a bowl of porridge, friendly greeting, and he goes his peaceful way. I have had much &#x201C;going out&#x201D; with other people for the last fortnight; but am as good as determined not to go out again for six weeks; but stand by my work, which is the only thing that turns to aught.&#x2014; <pb id="pg-08-93" n="08:93"/>&#x201C;Sandy Donaldson&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Welsh family lawyer.</note> is here from Haddington; but I was out when he called yesterday: Jane is going to dine at his Brother&#x2019;s some day; I &#x201C;decline from eet.&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. &#x201C;The phrase of a rustic cousin of ours, kind of solemn pedant in his way&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).

<p>Thanks for the Review; which I looked into not without interest; tho&#x2019;, as you anticipated, with but stinted edification. The Paper on Sedgwick is good and very good: distinguished by perfect precision; and set forth with a cold emphasis,&#x2014;satisfactory to look upon.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to Mill&#x2019;s review of the third edition of Professor Adam Sedgwick&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Discourse on the Studies of the University</hi> (Cambridge, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), in the <hi rend="italic">London Review</hi>, I (<date when="1835-04-00">April</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-07-00">July, 1835</date>), 94&#x2013;135; Mill&#x2019;s first important work on moral philosophy in which, as he said in his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> (London, <date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>), p. 200, he put into practice &#x201C;my scheme of conciliation between the old and the new &#x2018;philosophic radicalism.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> Sedgwick&#x2019;s title to <hi rend="italic">judge</hi> of the Utilitarians must be regarded as annihilated; he can only still have his feeling about them, and condemn their creed on the old principle of &#x201C;I do not like thee Dr Fell&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the jingle or epigram, &#x201C;I do not like thee, Dr. Fell, / The reason why I cannot tell,&#x201D; said to be by Thomas Brown about Dr. John Fell (<date when="1625-00-00">1625</date>&#x2013;<date when="1686-00-00">86</date>), Dean of Christ Church, Oxford.</note>&#x2014;which, after all, has its weight too.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I had been thinking, for some two days, of writing to you, when your Letter came.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A letter of <date when="1835-04-13">13 April</date> from his mother, his sister Janet (&#x201C;Jenny&#x201D;), and his brother James. Jenny explained in it that his mother was waiting for a draft or payment from Jack, and that she then meant to visit Dumfries and stay for two or three weeks to &#x201C;get her visitation over before you come home.&#x201D; His mother wrote, &#x201C;I have got no word from the DR but what I have got from you my faithfull corrospondent.&#x201D;</note> I was beginning to weary not a little for the first of the ruled sheets, to fancy that you had got some Spring Influenza, or other the like dainty of the season; tho&#x2019; Jane&#x2019;s Letter which went as you had calculated, did still me a little. Let me be thankful once more that you and the rest of them are well; that I can still send you the like tidings.</p>
<p>There is no order about Money here: for none has yet come to hand. Till it do come there can be no money drawn by any body; so that if the Order were even lost on the way hither, there were no harm done. But I think you had better not put off your Dumfries visit any longer waiting for this: go over to them as you propose; let James indicate by a word on the Newspaper that you are with him, and I can direct the Order if it arrive to Dumfries as well as Ecclefechan. From Jean&#x2019;s account, they seemed to be wearying very considerably for you. I sent Jean a Letter in a frank that was going to Templand: but on calculating I find she would not get it till the day before yesterday; and the news (which she is charged to send out to you) <pb id="pg-08-96" n="08:96"/>will scarcely be well perused till this fresh dispatch comes in the rear. Do not blame Jean, nor even me; for both of us did what we could. An old Letter and a new Letter are always two Letters; which I know my good Mother reckons two &#x201C;blessings.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I am struggling along with my second-edition Manuscript, in the best spirit I can. The second Chapter is done again; after a really tough battle; and the Third goes along much more sweetly. I was seized with some kind of bilious humour, which exhibited itself mainly in the shape of <hi rend="italic">Stupidity</hi>, the most inconvenient shape of all for me; so that I had my own <foreign><hi rend="italic">ados</hi></foreign> [difficulties]; and would have run over into Annandale (and given it up for a while),&#x2014;had I been near enough! There came farther a most extraordinary succession of <hi rend="italic">Parties</hi>, which with the talk and tea of them wore me quite down; till at last I stuck up, and refused to go out <hi rend="italic">anywhere</hi>, even to the simplest cup of tea; and lay at home, resting in the evenings, with the full conviction that to get on with my work was the only good for me, and better than tea-ing with Queen Adelaide (poor old <foreign><hi rend="italic">touchan</hi></foreign>),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Queen Adelaide (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>) had married William IV in <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date> when he was Duke of Clarence. A &#x201C;Tulchan&#x201D; is a calf&#x2019;s skin, stuffed merely with straw, set beside a cow to encourage her to milk: with the suggestion that she is a kind of dummy-queen, in view of the King&#x2019;s notorious infidelities.</note> had even she condescended to invite me. So I got thro&#x2019; the business; and am now afloat again, and going on, as I said, far more prosperously. It requires really great Christian virtue to hold patiently by this sad work: but I shall get thro&#x2019; it before long, and be all the better for such trial of my patience. Sometimes I think it will be better (as surely on the whole it must be); but sometimes too I think it <hi rend="italic">worse:</hi> and then what a thought is that! Every one of us is buckled into his harness, and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> on, be the road smooth or rough. You need not, my dear Mother, let it &#x201C;come into your mind like fire&#x201D; that I am working too hard!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His mother had written: &#x201C;I was vext for your misfortone of the Book but I hope it will be for good. all yea all things are of God He often brings good out of evil. therefor let us cast all our cares on him &#x2026; whatever our burding is let us cast it on him and He will sustain us and caus the Rightius man to remain unmoved. I will be glad to have you write a portion of it beside me. &#x2026; now Son it is come in my mind like fier that you are working too quick I beg you to take it easy and not to hurt yourself it is said there is luck o leasure.&#x201D;</note> I assure you, no; I take it very deliberately; even on a principle of <hi rend="italic">thrift;</hi> for always <hi rend="italic">Too-much</hi> today produces an overbalancing <hi rend="italic">Too-little</hi> tomorrow. But I have stood long to it, and shall be glad enough to have a little rest in Annandale.</p>
<p>For the rest, we are very content here, and have reason to be so. There are really some worthy people about us; we have <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in hand, <pb id="pg-08-97" n="08:97"/>and endeavour to hold by it faithfully, not heeding the future over much. It is a good while since I have, with wonderful good humour, desired it to do its worst against me: &#x201C;They <hi rend="small-caps">canna</hi> hinder thee of God&#x2019;s providence&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His mother had used this phrase on hearing of Jeffrey&#x2019;s refusal to support Carlyle for the Chair of Practical Astronomy; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340121-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:79</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> that is a great and proud truth, which ough<supplied>[t]</supplied> to keep one&#x2019;s heart easy at all times. If one can say to the world, as it runs there all on wheels, in new-gilt coaches or otherwise: &#x201C;Good world, I do in some measure know what ground I stand on; <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> probably dost the like?&#x201D;&#x2014;it is verily a blessing beyond price for one. Poor world! It is a wretched Phantasm, flickering like a cobweb on the bosom of Eternity; and too forgetful of that. The <hi rend="italic">dust</hi> it raises here and elsewhere will be all laid one day; and the <hi rend="italic">work</hi> it was doing in the inside of that be inquired into. We will not quarrel with it, but love it, pity it, and live not as it liveth.</p>
<p>I think I told you, last time, that I met my Lord Jeffrey on the street. He came down soon after, and has been here often since, tho&#x2019; he gets &#x201C;naa encooragement,&#x201D; or very little. I have sedulously abstained from speech whenever he alluded to that Promotion of ours; and have no other that I can do. The worthy Lord dreads that one almost may despise him; which really is not so impossible, tho&#x2019; to show it were thriftless. He even started the subject to Jane the other day, spoke of Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;never applying himself to any profession,&#x201D; never &#x201C;taking the way for promotion,&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c: but got only a scorching (of hot language) for his pains; and notice that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was not the man who knew best about Carlyle, who by the blessing of God trusted to get along without either profession or promotion&#x2014;of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> giving at least. I feel a real forgiveness of his poor Lordship, and pity for him; and remember always with quite another feeling my Mother&#x2019;s commentary on his work. He is grown <hi rend="italic">wizzened</hi> and old, body and mind, and gives one another mournful proof of what grey hairs with frivolity lead to.&#x2014; He goes this week; we are to see him only one other time.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sandy Donaldson&#x201D; of Haddington is also here: Jane went with him one day to a place called Wandsworth, and there met with a whole &#x201C;Haddington Colony&#x201D;; an old acquaintance of hers wife of Dunlop the Distiller,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Archibald Dunlop; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:89</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> who has just come to settle there. Dunlop is Walter&#x2019;s brother; was a mighty Distiller in Haddington; but became Bankrupt, and has now got some overseership in a &#x201C;Still-house&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Stillus</hi>) here; distills gin (called also <hi rend="italic">blue ruin</hi>), and may easily come to make a figure again, for he is really a clever fellow.&#x2014; Allan Cunningham <pb id="pg-08-98" n="08:98"/>is coming over to us tomorrow night; he has a Brother a Dr Cunningham (author of a very good Book about New Holland), who comes pretty often to us, and takes a bowl of porridge; a most innocent intelligent man, of singular <foreign><hi rend="italic">blateness</hi></foreign> [shyness], but very amusing when you get him to tell you of the things he has seen, for his sailings have extended round and round the world. I see the Bullers sometimes, who are always very kind: Charlie tells me about Political things, and is a very agreeable fellow, and getting on <hi rend="italic">well so far</hi>. He had some expectation of a kind of place in this New Ministry, but has got none, and contents himself. What is to come out of him ultimately I can never guess: he seems too <hi rend="italic">loose-made</hi> for mastering much, but has great cheerfulness and lightness of heart; far worse men are wafted along to considerable lengths.&#x2014;&#x2014; Mill&#x2019;s new Review is out: but it is really a very infirm thing; and must mend, or go to the wall. I have no hand in it hitherto; but they seem to have much need of me, or the like of me.</p>
<p>It is getting close upon supper-time, and I am weary of stooping and driving this assiduous Pen. How much more convenient were it, had we word of mouth! But we should be right grateful for the Pen too.&#x2014; I will give it up for this night, while the <foreign>ply</foreign> [state of mind, <foreign>fettle</foreign>] is good, I think. Except Supper <foreign><hi rend="italic">starken</hi></foreign> [strengthen] me a little, and I be tempted to resume. Good night, my dear Mother; may all that is Good be round you always.&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Tuesday <date when="1835-04-21">21st April</date></hi> (2 o&#x2019;clock P.M.).&#x2014;My dear Mother, having got over my day&#x2019;s task, better or worse, I will now before walking out, dash you off another word or two.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Wednesday,</hi> <date when="1835-04-22"><hi rend="italic">22</hi>nd <hi rend="italic">April</hi></date>.&#x2014;Alas, dear Mother, there is much comes between the cup and the lip. I had just got these words written down, when there came, <hi rend="italic">tit-tit-tat</hi>, a knock to the door; and two lady visiters [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] announced themselves (one of them Miss Fenwick, whom I think I mentioned to you), who sat talking till it was absolutely time to go out, if one meant to have a breath of free air at all; and then before dinner was well over, came the Cunninghams, with a certain Dr Willis (a good Edinburgh man) and his Wife, nay at last, John Mill with an English Radical friend of his, and so they sat talking, and keeping me on the stretch, till towards midnight, and with the trouble of it I was quite <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. This morning however I determine not to be baulked; and so set to work and finish this first, let my task prosper afterwards as it can. The outlook for that is not <hi rend="italic">good;</hi> so stupid do I feel today, with the over-much of talk last night; but we will be patient, and hope the next day may prove more productive.&#x2014; Yesterday, as we walked out (for Jane went with <pb id="pg-08-99" n="08:99"/>me), we saw on Sloane-Street a very sad sight: a poor but decent-looking middle-aged woman, fallen down dead! She seemed to have dropt instantaneously by some stroke of apoplexy; a Policeman and a quick-shifting crowd were round the spot; and there the poor woman lay, nobody knowing who she was: as we came back, four other Policemen were bearing the body to their Watch-house to lie there till it should be claimed.&#x2014; You will likely see a coroner&#x2019;s inquest about it in the Newspaper. Life is always &#x201C;fearful and wonderful&#x201D;;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 139:14.</note> Death always hovering nigh.</p>
<p>I learnt from Jane (Jean), what you mention in your Letter, that Alick is going to the Howes. So far as I can judge from this distance,it seems the reasonablest thing he could do: he will see what Annan <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, there; and whether there is not something in it which he could hopefully put out hand to. Give my brotherly love to him, and best encouragements: he has had a rough struggle hitherto, with no great return in money or in comfort; but tell him, there are better returns than that. If he keep his eyes open and his heart free and clear, there is no ultimate defeat to be apprehended. I hope he will write soon, and tell me freely all that he fears, hopes, purposes.&#x2014; I am sorry to hear they did not get the Houses at Ecclefechan repaired last year; it is a thing that <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be done, and will only be so much the worse to do this year. Oh I have many things to ask you about, and see into; but by and by I hope to be there with my own eyes. If this sorrowful <hi rend="italic">Manuscript</hi> would only get on a little faster! But I must not fret myself with that either; the <hi rend="italic">softlier</hi> I go to work, in <hi rend="italic">such</hi> business, I find it the better.</p>
<p>I hope the two little Newcomers are taking kindly to the singular new quarters they have got into. May the Author of all Being be good to them! Life is made up of black and white for us all; and yet it is a Gift the highest we know of in this universe.&#x2014; I am sorry to hear that poor Mary&#x2019;s <foreign>lassie</foreign> has been out of order, but hope matters have now taken a favourable turn. Jean tells me that James Austin gets plenty of work; in which case, I cannot but think they have reason to feel rather snug in their <hi rend="italic">upputting</hi>, a much quieter one than most people have in these times. I look upon it as wise in them not to think of Farming, as matters go at present: every trade has its sorrows; but none is so bad as that of a man who must work and not only get no wages, but be thrown into jail over and above; which is the case with many a Farmer at present.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-100" n="08:100"/>My good little Jenny must be thanked very heartily for her portion of a Letter. I would answer it by a Letter in full; but she sees how I am situated! James also you must greet <supplied>[for]</supplied> me with brotherly salutation; and the like excuse. Tell him however to bestir himself, and get the Houses repaired: I shall be <hi rend="italic">very sorry</hi> to see them still un-repaired when I come to you. Our friendliest regards to the young Mother and her son.&#x2014; Do you ever see Grahame of Burnswark? He sent me a very kind Letter not long since; says he called, with the Hoddam Minister, but found you out. If I can scrape together <hi rend="italic">any</hi> time today, I ought to send him a word of answer. He is a good friendly man.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 78&#x2013;84, Carlyle writes of Graham and mentions that he was &#x201C;ever attentive&#x201D; to old Mrs. Carlyle, and that he wrote &#x201C;long <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, not unpleasant to &#x2018;read and <hi rend="italic">burn</hi>.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; I have wrapped you up the last <hi rend="italic">Globe:</hi> if Buller prove to be at home, you may get them both on the same day: at <supplied>[s]</supplied>lowest you will get this with the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, on Sabbath. Our old Melbourne Ministry, you will see, is in again: they will not continue long unchanged; nor can any ministry in these times: the poor King is by some said not to be quite <hi rend="italic">right in the head;</hi> and the Country is all at sixes and sevens.

She is in general decidedly better than she used to be, and happier; a very resolute, true, little dame.&#x2014; I will not turn the leaf. May God bless you, dear Mother!

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> came on Monday; right welcome as all your Letters are; and with the best news it could bring us: that you are well, and almost on your way homeward. Would you were but safe arrived! It is among the liveliest prayers I form at present; one with which more <pb id="pg-08-101" n="08:101"/>of my hopes lie connected than with any other. Let us trust that this blessing also will be vouchsafed us, by the kind Power to whom we owe many.&#x2014; I would have answered you in time for Tuesday&#x2019;s post; had I not, calculating your probabilities of movement, judged that there was no haste; that, of course the <hi rend="italic">newer</hi> your news at Bologna were the better they would suit you.</p>
<p>To begin as usual with Scotland. I had a <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> today with the <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> on it; I have heard from our Mother herself since I wrote to you; and have nothing that is not favourable to report. Jean too has sent me a Letter; later I think than my last to you. The chief article of tidings is that you have a new Nephew and Niece; belonging more immediately to Alick and Jamie; the Nephew is Jamie&#x2019;s: both the Mothers were well; the poor (&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03B1; &#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B7;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;) &#x201C;unspeaking infants&#x201D; are to be named, or most probably are named, James and Margaret, in memory of whom you know.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After Carlyle&#x2019;s father, who had died <date when="1832-01-21">21 Jan. 1832</date>, his mother, Margaret, and his sister who had died in <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>.</note> One generation passeth away, and another cometh!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccl. 1:4.</note> It is the <hi rend="italic">Law</hi> of our Being here; and all men <hi rend="italic">must</hi> obey it.&#x2014; Our good Mother writes cheerfully as ever; has &#x201C;nothing to complain of&#x201D;; lives, I daresay, just now in one hope more than any other that of seeing us both beside her again once more, were it only for a time. Alick seems to have finished a bargain for some House at the <hi rend="italic">Howes</hi> (beside Annan): no particulars are yet given; but I suppose there is some park or parks attached to the House; and that Alick means to stand on the outlook there, and see whether there is nothing in the Dealing way that he can profitably strike into. I mean to write to him soon, tho&#x2019; he is in my debt; and expect to get more special intelligence. So far as will appear at this distance, there seemed nothing likelier among his capabilities at this time. We shall pray and even hope that it may be a favourable change for him; the beginning of a much more genial way of life. He has struggled as toughly and with as poor result, in his line, as many of us have in ours: a hard little button, that will not let himself be beaten; which indeed is properly the only victory one can gain in this world.&#x2014; I had a Letter from Burnswark<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From William Graham, not found, but mentioned in <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350409-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1835-04-09">9 April</date></ref>.</note> also; full of kindness, praises, friendliness: of the hope that we three were to wander one other day on the sides of that old Roman Hill, under bright weather. Poor Graham seems to have dark clouds lying in the distance; but he does not dwell on them: there is <hi rend="italic">much</hi> in such a man; so full of brotherliness, of heart and <pb id="pg-08-102" n="08:102"/>health, and right temper towards all things.&#x2014; We often hear from Mrs Welsh, who is most minute in sending us word, and even writes previously to Dumfries for Annandale news. Poor George Welsh (of Boreland, Jane&#x2019;s Uncle)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane&#x2019;s paternal uncle, &#x201C;a spirited and clever man&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-04/lt-18261001-JBW-MW-01"><sic>4:144</sic><corr>JBW to MW, <date when="1826-10-01">1 Oct. 1826</date></corr></ref>), who did not die until the summer (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350920-JWC-MW-01">JWC to <sic>Mrs GW</sic><corr>MW</corr>, <date when="1835-09-20">20 Sept.</date></ref>). Boreland was near Southwick, Galloway.</note> is not expected to live many days: he has been wasting (with dyspepsia, and inflammatory tendencies and habits) these several years. Old Carlyle of Sandbed, I noticed in this day&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, is gone: aged 93. He was the oldest human figure of my world: our Father&#x2019;s first Father-in-law. I remember riding past his house (from Hoddam Hill) one dewy May night, ten years ago; and hearing the sound of his Evening Psalm ascend amid the whispers of the Brownmoor Wood,&#x2014;towards Eternity.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> of <date when="1835-04-29">29 April 1835</date> reported: &#x201C;John Carlyle (aged 93) died Sandbed, Middlebie parish, on <date when="1835-04-20">20 April</date>.&#x201D; See also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, intro. Ian Campbell (London, <date when="1972-00-00">1972</date>) p. 27, &#x201C;a professor of Religion, but long since suspected to be none of the most perfect, though not without his worth.&#x201D;</note> Man&#x2019;s Life is as a Shadow;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccl. 8:13.</note> but there is a Spirit in Man that dies <hi rend="italic">not;</hi> also in what Man <hi rend="italic">does</hi>, if he take heed to it.&#x2014; And now I must take you Southward, as far as Cheyne Row here; and the desk I now write at.</p>
<p>You are very brotherly and considerate with your care about my health. I believe every word of the precepts you send: it is a melancholy truth that toil and effort in this task of mine often defeat their own object. There are days of the dreariest dogged wretchedness and ineffectual endeavour, when in four and twenty hours one does not accomplish the work of one. I do believe, it were better to give it up wholly; and go out, and run the country: however, I cannot hitherto at any time determine on that. It seems to me as if I had no chance in the race, except the tortoise&#x2019;s chance: stubborn perseverance, were it at the rate of an inch per day. My whole wishes are bent to be done with this <hi rend="italic">re</hi>-writing; surely the most leaden, discouraging, all but intolerable task I ever had to do; in which there is this only that spirits me on: the feeling that I ought to do it, that I can do it, at least and lowest that I <hi rend="italic">will</hi>. O were I thro&#x2019; it! I fancy I should fly then, as on wings, thro&#x2019; the free <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> portion of my enterprise. Courage! I still hope to have it over, by the time you appoint for arriving; and so a great <hi rend="italic">double</hi> happiness (negative and positive) shall fall to me at once. Now you fancy that I am working myself down: but I assure you, my health is not bad, nor worsening; I am yellow indeed and thin, and feel that a rest will be very welcome and beneficial; nevertheless <pb id="pg-08-103" n="08:103"/>I repeat, my health tho&#x2019; changed, seems to me decidedly not <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than it was. I can walk farther than I used to do: my spirits if never high are in general quiet, contented even (<foreign><hi rend="italic">zufrieden, aber mir ist nicht wohl dabey</hi></foreign> [Content, but I don&#x2019;t feel good about it]!): I have more and more a kind of hope that I shall get <hi rend="italic">well</hi> again yet before my Life end. With health and peace for one year, it seems to me often as if I could write a better Book than any there has been in this Country for generations: if it be God&#x2019;s ordering, I shall <hi rend="italic">get</hi> well; if not, I hope I shall work on indomitably as I am. Beautiful is that of brave old Voss, and often comes in my mind: &#x201C;As the Earth, now in azure sunshine seen of all the stars, now in dark tempests hidden, <hi rend="italic">holds on</hi> her journey round the sun&#x201D;!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lines 70&#x2013;74 of J. H. Voss&#x2019;s &#x201C;Die Weihe&#x201D; to his translation of <hi rend="italic">Homers Werke</hi>, 2 vols. (Stuttgart und T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>), I, 9; cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360429-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1836-04-29">29 April 1836</date></ref>.</note> Good also is this that you give me: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lass es um Dich wettern</hi></foreign> [Let it storm about you]. I really try to do so, and succeed.&#x2014; I am pretty well on with my Third Chapter; and have been doing much better for the last ten days; both because the work is more towardly, and my wits are more about me. For three weeks previously I had a sad time of it: there came like a dark thick veil over my poor head, so that I could <hi rend="italic">see</hi> nothing, but sat there piecing the incoherent that would not cohere; miserable enough! It was partly the spring weather too; for all the world had its <hi rend="italic">influenza;</hi> my little Dame here has hardly done yet with the Cold she had. I refused to go out to any party, even to tea; struggled on, and am here, under better omens. Mill and I settled: he pleaded for the &#xa3;200 or some intermediate sum; but I found we must stick by the rigorous calculation of it, and I took &#xa3;100. Since then, I have seen almost rather less of Mill than before; nor am I sorry at it, <hi rend="italic">till this work be done;</hi> there is an express agreement that we are not to mention it till then. He is a pure-minded clear man every way; but with the strangest, unluckiest Utilitarian husk round him, which he will never cast off: it strikes me very much how all these people look forever at some <hi rend="italic">theory of a thing</hi>, never at any <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>. Poor Mill&#x2019;s Platonica is, as you judge, little likely to help him: indeed all his friends are very anxious about it; I for my share can see no wholesomeness in the witchery of the woman; nothing but passionate <hi rend="italic">revolt</hi> (against much that will not be revolted against), exaggerated <foreign><hi rend="italic">apper&#x26;ccedil;us</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>, insights], rather than calm thoughts; petulant sparkling, no wise shining: a bad connexion, consider it as one will! Mill has out No 1 of his &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">London Review</hi>,&#x201D; and an Article of his own in it <pb id="pg-08-104" n="08:104"/>(against some Anti-utilitarian Cambridge Professor), which the Radicals exceedingly admire: it has precision, closeness, coldness,&#x2014;barrenness. Barren, indeed, as Saha<supplied>[ra]</supplied> is the whole Review; as soft to lie down on, as green and productive, as the Pavement of Bond-S<supplied>[treet]</supplied> one&#x2019;s soul <foreign><hi rend="italic">scunners</hi></foreign> [shudders] at the thought that this is for the present the truest thing going in Eng<supplied>[land. I]</supplied> believe I might have plenty of work (for a time) in this new Enterprise; but they shall not tempt me from the other duty. We shall be provided for, one way or other,&#x2014;independently of the Devil. Indeed it often strikes me as strange what an &#x201C;unspeakable composure&#x201D; I have got into about Economics and money. It seems to me I should not mind a jot if hard <hi rend="italic">had</hi> come to hard, and they had <foreign><hi rend="italic">rouped</hi></foreign> me [sold me up] out of house and hold [refuge], and the very shirt off my back: I should say, Be it so; our course lies <hi rend="italic">elsewhither</hi> then. Thou, my brave Doil, shalt share thy poor purse with me, if I need it: as yet I know no other mortal that shall. So forward, my Boy; let us &#x201C;go with God&#x201D;; towards what God has chosen us for! We have struggled on hitherto, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> taking the Devil into partnership; the time that remains is short, the <hi rend="italic">Eternity</hi> is long. My little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Heldinn</hi></foreign> [heroic wife] is ready to share any fortune with me; we will fear nothing but falling into the hands of the Destroyer.&#x2014;&#x2014; I find I shall have no space to say a word about our Company-keeping and many <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> this time. Be content; and hope that we shall soon have faculty to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> of it together. We have seen Mrs Somerville (an unblameable, unpraisable <foreign><hi rend="italic">canny</hi></foreign> Scotch lady, of intellect enough to study Euclid, and not more than enough); Taylor (<hi rend="italic">von Artevelde</hi>, a man who grows on me, slowly), Sandy Donaldson (from Haddington) &#x26;c &#x26;c: plenty of people, and really rather good people, beyond the average. The Austins are gone: to Hastings; thence to Boulogne: no mortal seems to remember that they ever existed here, tho&#x2019; their door was like a <hi rend="italic">winning-post</hi> on a race-ground&#x2014;for (aimless) carriages, and carriage-ladies. <foreign><hi rend="small-caps">das</hi> <hi rend="italic">hole der Teufel</hi></foreign> [Let the devil take that]!&#x2014;While I went with your last Epistle (<hi rend="italic">mine</hi> I mean) to Charing Cross, I <hi rend="italic">met</hi> Lord Jeffrey in Pall Mall; grey dusty, &#x201C;just two hours in Town.&#x201D; I saluted the little man and lord with real heartiness: he has come fiddling about us ever since till last Sunday, when he took leave for the North. He is dimmed and wizzened; a man grown old without the dignity of age, one pities and rather likes him. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Valeat</hi></foreign> [Let him flourish]!&#x2014; By the bye, your money never came, nor no hint of it yet. Did a Letter from the Lady to her Banker miscarry? Of the sum itself there can I suppose be no risk; yet I wish you had chanced to say something of it in your <pb id="pg-08-105" n="08:105"/>letter. Our good Mother has been waiting ever since your Letter came, to pay her visit to Jean when I should &#x201C;remit the bill&#x201D;: I wrote last week that she was to wait no longer.</p>
<p>Surely somehow this sheet has been wasted: it is so soon done; gone one knows not how. May it find you well in bright Lombardy, happy on your way hither. Whither shall I write next to you? At Paris I shall perhaps have some commissions. Do you go by Venice again; by Innsbr&#xfc;ck? In Lombardy I know nothing to remind you of but Palladio&#x2019;s<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrea Palladio (<date when="1508-00-00">1508</date>&#x2013;<date when="1580-00-00">80</date>) Italian architect, author of <hi rend="italic">I Quattra Libri Architettura</hi> (Venice, <date when="1570-00-00">1570</date>), which was translated into English, with notes by Inigo Jones (London, <date when="1715-00-00">1715</date>). His Palladian style was influential in eighteenth century English architecture.</note> Buildings: they are in Padua, Verona, I suppose in Bologna, and worth asking after. It will be interesting enough to revisit your old M&#xfc;nchen; it changed, and you still more! Remember me to Lichtenthaler;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Director of the Royal Library, Munich, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280416-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:361</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-04-16">16 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> I hardly recollect any other. Will you go some evening to your old Coffee-house? Your description of it was the original of Teufel&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">zum Gr&#xfc;nen Ganse</hi></foreign> [Green Goose].<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 15, 19, 296, etc.</note> I will write no more tonight. A foolish scatterbrain German Bookseller came in after tea (to talk about an unfeasible project), and dispersed all my notions; in time, would have driven me <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>. He speaks, rapidly, and in the way a man might run <hi rend="italic">in a sack;</hi> such a futile chattering and chewing, and toiling, <hi rend="italic">syringing</hi> out boundless ineffectual froth-jets would either make you kill him (figuratively speaking), or yourself die of laughter.&#x2014; Tomorrow I hope Jane will add a Postscript; I fill the margins&#x2014; Good night my dear Jack! If wishes can travel so far, you are <hi rend="italic">well</hi>.</p>
<p>[JWC&#x2019;s postscript:]</p>
<p><salute>Dearest John&#x2014;</salute> Your letter not only raised our spirits at the time, but has kept them raised ever since&#x2014;its good influence is traceable even in the diminished yellow of my Husbands face, and in the accelerated speed of his writing. Bless you for it and for the kind feelings which make you a Brother well worth having, a Man well worth loving. Surely we shall not quarrel any more after having ascertained in absence how well we like one another! Alas surely we shall!&#x2014;for one of us at least is <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;only a plain human creature&#x201D;</hi><note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained coterie speech.</note> liable to quarrel and to do every thing that is unwise&#x2014; But we will do it as little as possible&#x2014;and be good friends all the while at heart&#x2014; The book is going <pb id="pg-08-106" n="08:106"/>to be a good book in spite of bad fortune&#x2014;and what is lost is by no means to be looked upon as wasted&#x2014;what he faithful <hi rend="italic">did</hi> in it and also what he magnaimously [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <hi rend="italic">endured</hi> remains for him and us&#x2014;not to be annihilated <supplied>[.]</supplied> How we shall enjoy our visit to Scotland when the volume is redone! Shall we resume Ariosto where we left him? and the battle-dores are here&#x2014;and more suitable <hi rend="italic">ceilings! much</hi> is more suitable&#x2014;Heaven send you safe!</p>
<p>The Noble Lady<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Dorothea Montagu.</note> has <hi rend="italic">taken up the thread of our old relation</hi> but it remains held only at one end&#x2014;</p>
<p>[TC&#x2019;s postscript:]</p>
<p>Friday half past 2&#x2014; <salute>Dear Jack,</salute> I have sat the whole morning scribbling, and made out almost <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> (that will stick): I now give it up; and will go with your Letter to the Post Office&#x2014;as patient as I can&#x2014; Whence will you write me next? Let me sit diligent here (<hi rend="italic">judiciously</hi> so), and have &#x201C;all by&#x201D; when you come to me. O the confusion that is in this head of mine! But I will say no more of it.</p>
<p>Charles Buller has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> got into Office in this late change: to the disappointment of his Mother, who I hear is vehement in her expression of it. He will have a chance some other day. I do not grow to like Charles any better: there seems to me great secret ambition in him, with loose <hi rend="italic">unregulation</hi> every way nothing strong but his light <hi rend="italic">indolence</hi>, his light good humour: Politics bode him perhaps no improvement.</p>
<p>Cunningham and Willis with their wives were here the other night. Willis has no Library work at present, the House is new building. Mary&#x2019;s eldest child has been unwell; Waugh attended it; recovering, or recovered. We have had the bitterest variable weather; till the day before yesterday there began a deluge of rain; and now the wind promises to quit the north,&#x2014;to the benefit of us all.</p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I have learned more or less distinctly that you are actually going towards Annan; that you have engaged a House at the <hi rend="italic">Howes</hi>, <pb id="pg-08-107" n="08:107"/>probably the one you were thinking of a good while ago. I could like very much to hear from yourself more minutely about it: but I know the writing of a Letter takes up time; and you will have business in plenty before you. Only three weeks or so till Whitsunday; and all your goods and gear to get transported or disposed of: <foreign><hi rend="italic">roups</hi></foreign> [sales] (perhaps), settlements, and confusions of all kinds. If you have any evening to yourself, pray write to me: a full free account of what you are in the midst of, of what you see before you. At any rate, I send <hi rend="italic">you</hi> this little line, in testimony of my brotherly prayers for you; that I am thinking of you, tho&#x2019; far enough from the scene of your difficulties and exertions. The Frank will carry the scrap of paper, and it will not be unwelcome.</p>
<p>So far as I can estimate the circumstances, it seems to me you have acted wisely in that selection of an abode. Annan is of all the places in Scotland the one you appear to have the best chance at. Keep up your heart, my brave Brother; look patiently, clearly, coolly out in the business you will see going on round you; consider what thread of it you can clutch hold of, and begin winding. I believe you have abundant faculty in you for doing well; I will hope you are about beginning a more favourable course of endeavour than any you have yet engaged in.</p>
<p>My Mother wrote to me that you had got a new Daughter, and that all was doing well with her and her Mother. She is to be called Margaret. May she resemble her namesake! May her life be happy; or say rather, <hi rend="italic">wise</hi>, which is the only kind of happiness one is entitled to look for!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was to die on <date when="1836-02-13">13 Feb. 1836</date>.</note></p>
<p>As for us, Jack&#x2019;s Letter and my Mother will tell you this piece of glad news, that we can hope to be with you in Annandale all together (if God will) before these new Summer leaves grow brown! You shall then hear all our adventures, at full leisure; and we shall have much to question you about in return. Let us be thankful for such expected blessings: many a lot that looks fairer than ours is without such.</p>
<p>Doubtless you have heard of my sorrowful misfortune of the lost Manuscript. It <foreign><hi rend="italic">hauds me sair down</hi></foreign> [afflicts me sorely] for the present; but I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be thro&#x2019; it; and shall fly all the lighter were that once accomplished. There never in my life befel me any mere &#x201C;mischance&#x201D; of a more provoking kind. I am in the Third Chapter again, and getting on slowly (for my head somehow is very stupid), yet as well as <pb id="pg-08-108" n="08:108"/>I can.&#x2014; I have hope sometimes that it will really be a good Book,&#x2014;in spite, literally, of the Devil.</p>
<p>Will you when you go to Annan remember Jane and me to Mary and her household at the Battery. We heard her <foreign>lassie</foreign> was ill; but in the way of recovery. There is a new Dumfries Newspaper<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>, founded in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> by the Tories, was edited by Thomas Aird (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>) until <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>. It was intended to defend the Corn Laws and the established church.</note> of which I sent her the first Number: if Mrs Welsh send it hither regularly, I can forward it to Mary regularly. Tell me how yours is to be directed after Whitsunday.&#x2014; I have sent no special compliments to Scotsbrig; but you must give my remembrances to one and all. The good little Jenny has even some claim on me for a letter (clear claim for <hi rend="italic">half</hi> a letter); which shall be attended to. I hope Jamie finds the farmer-year better than many a one finds it: there have been few worse it is everywhere said. And <supplied>[when]</supplied> is there to be any <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi> that one can depen<supplied>[d]</supplied> on? <supplied>[Al]</supplied>as, it is a tough battle all men have, and hav<supplied>[e alw]</supplied>ays had. Stand to it toughly, then! There is no other help.</p>
<p>Tell little Tom he has some new relations to see and welcome in the course of the season. Jane I suppose is grown quite a prudent young woman. Her namesake joins with me in affectionate salutation to you all. <closer><salute>God be with you, dear Brother!</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>We have a cut of the Catlinns Ham generally every morning; and find it one of the best ever eaten. It does not disagree with me.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>As you heard from me so very lately I will be brief tonight: but the Frank and Jack&#x2019;s Letter must not go without a word from me. We are &#x201C;well, and going on in the old way&#x201D;; that is the sum and substance of all I have to tell you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-109" n="08:109"/>The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> you did not get last week; but I daresay you already imputed it to some other than the most punctual <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. In fact, it was Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s fault or misfortune: he sent me the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Examiners just last night; and this night they are underway to you: I read what I wanted of them before Coffee this morning. When no <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> comes, you may in general count on getting some Newspaper or other on Sabbath: however, I believe I disappointed you last week even in that; there happened (greatly to my own disappointment, when I looked) to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> no Newspaper forthcoming on the Friday. It is no trouble to me the sending of these Newspapers: I walk daily out; and nine times out of ten I prefer walking townwards at any rate; that is straight past the Post-Office, for there is one which road soever I take. The bustle of living creatures all dashing and driving along is in general far more interesting to me than any country walk I can get here: indeed these walks on the bare edge of the <hi rend="italic">Glaisters Hill</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A long ridge opposite the house at Craigenputtoch.</note> may serve me for country walks, I think, some years yet.</p>
<p>Jack you will see, and have probably heard in your own Letter, promises, if all go well, to be home with us in the end of <date when="1835-06-00">June</date>. I wish we saw him! Let us trust in a Good Providence, we shall; and meet together all of us yet again, for the better and not for the worse!&#x2014; I have sent off a long Letter to Jack this day; to lie for him at Bologna (in the North of Italy), where it will likely be before he is. If the &#x201C;bowls row right,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., &#x201C;bowls roll right,&#x201D; if all goes smoothly.</note> I shall be done with my poor volume by the time he comes; and then with what joy shall we start together for the North!</p>
<p>Jane has had a sort of cold, which is mostly gone now: the like has been very general; what they call an <hi rend="italic">influenza;</hi> so bad has the Spring weather been: first oppressively hot; then three weeks of as bitter northerly Cold as I can recollect; which last is only just ended, in a plunge of rain that kept falling for four-and-twenty hours.</p>
<p>We are parting with our Lancaster servant: it is impossible for human patience to put up with such transcendency of <foreign><hi rend="italic">pluistering</hi></foreign> [slovenly messing] any longer. Scotch dirt is cleanliness to the English dirt when they are dirty. I believe this poor creature (who is otherwise full of innocence, and even not without sense) has some bodily disease; the quantity of Bread she eats is said to be enormous&#x2014;fully <hi rend="italic">three times</hi> the natural quantity; yet she looks well and rosy. Jane wrote to the Mother at Lancaster; advising that the girl should be <pb id="pg-08-110" n="08:110"/>sent for home; which has been done. She goes on Monday; and I shall wish heartily that she may be well, at a distance from <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Ireland, who nonetheless had a taste for Goethe and loved Mrs. Carlyle in spite of her scoldings.</note>&#x2014; Our new Servant is an old one of Mrs Austin&#x2019;s; who in all human probability will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be such a slut of sluts as this: stern experience has taught me to expect little of the like of her. I often passionately declare that (if it were not for the talk of the world) I would really rather take some little apartment, and cook and sweep for myself. As my brave Uncle Tom<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carlyle (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>), youngest of his father&#x2019;s three brothers.</note> did! A nation that is made up of such wretched mortals as these <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> but go (and pretty rapidly) to all kinds of confusion. Holcroft,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Thomas Holcroft the younger; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:50</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> who was here today, told us about being down at Sheerness this week; seeing a Ship with Female Emigrants sail for New Holland: there were between 200 and 300 young women; what do you think the <hi rend="italic">sea-store</hi> of some of them consisted of? The whole stock they had set out to sail round the world with? Besides the <foreign><hi rend="italic">duds</hi></foreign> [clothes] on their back: a grey-paper bag, with three or four biscuits, and&#x2014;a Lace Cap! Holcroft says there were several of them that had just this. Happily the &#x201C;Managing Committee&#x201D; had (underhand) provided them with clothes and necessaries. They sailed, some <foreign><hi rend="italic">greeting</hi></foreign> [crying], some singing; but waved their bonnets and gave three cheers as the ship bore away. It is a good outlet for <foreign>shifty</foreign> [resourceful] decent young women: &#x201C;between 15 and 30 years old.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is unlikely that the emigrants were, in fact, bound for New Holland (the name for Western Australia) rather than New South Wales, to the east as emigration to the former had been stopped in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>; and, whether Holcroft was right or not Carlyle himself seems to have been confused about the &#x201C;New Holland,&#x201D; since he speaks of Peter Cunningham&#x2019;s book, <hi rend="italic">Two Years in New South Wales</hi>, as his book about &#x201C;New Holland&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-08/lt-18350420-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1835-04-20">20</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-04-21">21 April</date></ref>). The distinction had grown up only in the early years of the century. From <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date> the Colonial Office sponsored female emigration through the London Emigration Committee which despatched four ships to Australia during <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>. From <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date> to <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, 2,784 immigrants were sent out by the Committee, over 2,000 of them free (that is, nonconvict) females. The young women were between 15 and 30, and the colonists had complained in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> with evident good reason that they were often very badly chosen, which had led to a tightening of regulations in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>. Holcroft possibly saw the <hi rend="italic">Canton</hi> which left Gravesend for Sydney, <date when="1835-05-01">1 May</date>, with 239 emigrants, 171 of them the free females. Sheerness is 51 miles east of London, in Kent, at the entrance of the river Medway into the Thames.</note></p>
<p>I find no notice about Jack&#x2019;s money in the Letter; and suppose Lady Clare or somebody must have made some omission or suffered some mistake about it: however, it is no matter; for of the money itself there cannot be any danger. I mentioned to Jack how it stood; <pb id="pg-08-111" n="08:111"/>and also that I had desired you not to wait longer for it, but to go and <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> your visit.</p>
<p>There is a great <foreign><hi rend="italic">sugh</hi></foreign> [windy noise] going on here with changes in Government, &#x26;c; which we happily hear as little of as possible. To us they can literally &#x201C;do neither ill na&#x2019; guid.&#x201D; I see nothing but change on change; and any change for the better still at a great distance. The Torys are desperate at being out; and may (if this poor half-daft Majesty of ours live long) get in again for a short time: but they and the like of them are evidently on <hi rend="italic">quick march</hi> towards dissolution and oblivion. The Ex-Chancellor (Brougham) is secretly publishing some of the strangest stuff about Lords and the House of Lords:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Under the pseudonym of &#x201C;Isaac Tomkins,&#x201D; Lord Brougham had published a series of popular pamphlets: <hi rend="italic">Thoughts upon the Aristocracy of England</hi>, 3rd ed.

(London, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>). &#x201C;Jenkins&#x201D; was also Lord Brougham.</note> very significant that the <hi rend="italic">conclusion</hi> is drawing on. &#x201C;I have seen it visibly,&#x201D; as you say, dear Mother: for indeed it is a thing to be seen. Wellington has disappointed me,&#x2014;unless he means to <hi rend="italic">come back</hi> another time. Or perhaps he is at bottom only a <hi rend="italic">wooden man</hi>; and has done what he could <supplied>[d]</supplied>o. I saw him not many nights ago stepping across Piccadilly into his House, in the quiet dusk: a greywhiskered, hollow-cheeked, <hi rend="italic">surprised</hi>-looking, almost foolish-looking old gentleman; whose physiognomy surely inspired me with no terror or reverence. He had to go his way, I mine.</p>
<p>Mrs Austin seems to be here again; half in secret; looking after the letting of her house. We are to go up and drink tea with her; and she promises Jane a chair; I and herself are to sit on stools or as tailors do, for the whole establishment is dismantled. It is truly sad to see how soon the place of the most popular public favourites is filled up: Mrs A. had carriages by the score at her house daily, and you could not see her, or hear yourself speak to her for the cackle of admiring lady-visitors, and already it seems to be forgotten that she ever existed: nobody can give you the smallest news of her; appears to think any speech on the subject a superfluity.&#x2014;&#x2014; Jane wants &#x201C;a little Postscript&#x201D; for tomorrow: tonight she is not well with her head. I must leave off therefore with excessive abruptness. Good night, dear Mother; good night to you and all of them! <closer><salute>May the great Preserver watch over you!&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<p>I almost think this promised visit to Scotsbrig did not take effect,&#x2014;John&#x2019;s own part of it having failed, and general uncertainty having thereupon supervened.

<p>I called yesterday, with these two Letters,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350501-TC-AC-01">TC to AC</ref> and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350501-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, both <date when="1835-05-01">1 May</date></ref>, which were to go with Dr. John Carlyle&#x2019;s last letter under the same cover, franked by Roebuck, to Ecclefechan.</note> on Buller; but found him removed to some other House. If you in the course you travel fall in with any Liberal Member, I think it will really be a forwarding of the Greatest Happiness Principle on his part<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There is goodnatured irony in placing the request on this basis in addressing the Utilitarian Mill, since Carlyle did not, as Mill well knew, approve of the &#x201C;Greatest Happiness Principle.&#x201D;</note> if he will consent to frank them. We pass you this afternoon, going to a kind of posthumous cup of tea with Mrs Austin.</p>
<p>I adhere to my old condition of stupefaction; it is really like a kind of enchantment: by my old friend, Diana-Hecate in the shape of bile!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I have written to you very often of late, yet, recollecting what Jean tells me about the &#x201C;Bills pinned up in your pockets,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had written on <date when="1835-05-01">1 May</date> to say that her mother had received a letter from Dr. John Carlyle saying that he would be home early in <date when="1835-07-00">July</date>, and that he had sent his mother money in the form of &#x201C;Bills.&#x201D; She goes on: &#x201C;You will no doubt send her proper directions how to act with these Bills She has brought them all with her with three strong pins stuck across the pocket &#x26; exprest some uneasiness that it was not <hi rend="italic">sowed</hi>.&#x201D;</note> I believe <pb id="pg-08-115" n="08:115"/>it will be well for me to send you another hasty scratch of the pen today. Tomorrow, as I compute, you may by the Carrier get that last Packet with Jack&#x2019;s Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Brussels, dated <date when="1835-04-06">6 April</date>.</note> in it, which was sent off to Ecclefechan; you shall then have some kind of respite from reading Letters (tho&#x2019; I know well it is reckoned no great <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> by you): after which, as we trust and hope, we shall see you once more face to face, and get on by speech not paper.</p>
<p>But first with regard to those Bills, let me explain to you that all you have to do is to go with them any day to the Bank; and, laying the Papers down on the counter, request the people to pay your <hi rend="italic">annual</hi>. James Aitken will go with you, to testify if need be, that you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> Mrs Carlyle: the interest is made expressly payable to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>. What it will amount to I know not; but whatever it is, you are to take it, and get for yourself necessary or convenient things with it: that was Jack&#x2019;s meaning. As to the other draught for money, I now make no doubt but it is lying payable for me at some bank in Lombard Street here; but that between Lady Clare and her Banker the expressed intention of <hi rend="italic">warning</hi> me that it so lay has fallen thro&#x2019;; and so till new notice from the Doctor, these Lombard Street men <hi rend="italic">durst</hi> not pay it to me (even if I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> forgotten what their name is, and <hi rend="italic">could</hi> speak to them); for, in case of paying it to the wrong man, the loss would be <hi rend="italic">theirs</hi>, which they would have to make good again. It will therefore have to lie over till we hear farther; or what were better till our good Doctor make his appearance in person here. There is little ill done, or next to none; and no danger at all.</p>
<p>Jean&#x2019;s Letter gave us a kind of alarm till we got it burst up: I saw that it was white inside, and bad possibilities occurred to me; it was very considerate in her to put &#x201C;nothing wrong&#x201D; at the top,&#x2014;whereby one could read without trepidation whatsoever <hi rend="italic">was</hi> written.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This is not clear, but Carlyle appears to suggest that the cover [not extant] of Jean&#x2019;s letter had a black seal, or some such mournful indication. The letter does have &#x201C;nothing wrong&#x201D; written at the top of it.</note> Let us be thankful still, for the great mercies of continued Life and Health to all of us; we have <hi rend="italic">more</hi> to be thankful for than we shall ever understand till we have lost it. &#x201C;Good fortune,&#x201D; as it is called in the world, may be in itself either good or indifferent or even bad: but the light of Life with peace and affection added to the means of living; <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is <pb id="pg-08-116" n="08:116"/>a blessing one ought to prize as the truest of all. I often think, in my forlornest moments, what part of his revenue many a Duke might offer for such affection as comes to me <hi rend="italic">un</hi> bought,&#x2014;and not get it with all the revenue he has.</p>
<p>You will learn without regret that I am <hi rend="italic">idling</hi>, or nearly so, for these last two days. My poor Work, the dreariest of its sort I ever undertook, was getting more and more untoward on me; I began to feel that toil and effort not only did not perceptibly advance it, but was even, by disheartening and disgusting me, retarding it. I gathered my papers together, therefore; sealed them up, and locked them in a drawer, with the determination not to touch <hi rend="italic">them</hi> again for one week from that date. I flatter myself it was a very meritorious determination. A man must not only be able to work, but to give over working. I have many times stood doggedly to work; but this is the first time I ever deliberately laid it down without finishing it. In fact, it is the strangest thing I ever tried that of re-writing my first Volume; one must vary his methods according to the task he has: take it gently, take it fiercely; you cannot tickle trouts in the way you spear whales. On the whole, it has given me very great trouble this poor Book, and Providence (in the shape of human Mismanagement) sent me the severest check of all: however, I still trust to get it written sufficiently: and if thou even <hi rend="italic">canst</hi> not write it (as I have said to myself in late days), why then be content with that too: God&#x2019;s Creation will get along, exactly as it should do, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the writing of it. At all events, my head shall settle itself, and my face clear itself in the pure May air of these days: I shall then be readier for this work, or for whatever else. There are other proposals hovering about me; but not worth speaking of yet. The &#x201C;Literary World&#x201D; here is a thing which I have had no other course left but to <hi rend="italic">defy</hi>&#x2014;in the Name of God! Man&#x2019;s imagination can fancy few things madder; but me (if God will) it shall not madden. I will take a <hi rend="italic">knapping</hi>-hammer<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A hammer for breaking stones in work on the roads.</note> first.</p>
<p>Meantime see what cheer comes to me from over the water! This is another Letter of the American&#x2019;s; introducing a Friend;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1835-03-11">11 March</date> introducing Henry Barnard (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1900-00-00">1900</date>), American educator, who was to help reform the public-school system in Connecticut and Rhode Island, to become Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">60</date>), President of St. John&#x2019;s College (<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>) and first U.S. Commissioner of Education (<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>). He edited the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Education</hi> (<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>), and compiled the <hi rend="italic">Library of Education</hi> in 52 vols.</note> whom we expect this night at ten. The good Yankees seem smit with some strange fatuity about me; which will abate in good time. Fraser, <pb id="pg-08-117" n="08:117"/>whom I saw yesterday, has no hope that an Edition of the Book<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> would sell here: so they must just provide <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi> with copies, these worthy souls. Nothing gives me such indubitable satisfaction about any of my Books as the fact always: That <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with them. That blessing was nearly all I expected from this poor <hi rend="italic">Revolution;</hi> and, alas, that is not so near as I expected. However, we will have patience. You can read this good Emerson&#x2019;s Letter, and put it by the other;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s short letter of introduction for Barnard was accompanied by a longer letter to Carlyle, of <date when="1835-03-12">12 March</date>, asking for Fraser to send 50 or 100 copies of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> to America to satisfy the present demand and suggesting the possibility of publication of the work there as Carlyle&#x2019;s admirers continued to increase.</note> and tell nobody of it: to you it will give real pleasure, and that perhaps is the chief good of it.</p>
<p>Everything is confused here with the everlasting jabber of Politics; in which I struggle altogether to hold my peace. The Radicals have made an enormous <hi rend="italic">advance</hi> by this little Tory interregnum;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peel&#x2019;s brief ministry.</note> it is not unlikely the Tories will try it one other time; they would even <hi rend="italic">fight</hi>, if they had anybody to fight for them: meanwhile these poor Melbourne people will be obliged to walk on at a much <hi rend="italic">quicker</hi> pace than formerly (considerably against their will, I believe) with the Radical bayonets pricking them behind; and so whether the Tories stay out, or whether they try to come in again, it will all be for the advance of Radicalism; which means <hi rend="italic">revolt</hi> against innumerable things, and (as I construe it) Dissolution and Confusion, at no great distance, and a Darkness which no man can see thro. Let them take it, and the thickest skin hold longest out! Everybody, radical and other, <hi rend="italic">every</hi> body here tells me that the condition of the Poor people is&#x2014;improving! My astonishment was great at first, but I now look for nothing else than this: &#x201C;improving daily.&#x201D; &#x201C;Well gentlemen,&#x201D; I answered once, &#x201C;the Poor I think will get up some day, and <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> you how improved their condition is.&#x201D; It seems to me the vainest jangling, this of the Peels and Russells,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord John Russell was Home Secretary in Melbourne&#x2019;s new ministry.</note> that ever the peaceful air was beaten into <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>peace by. But we are used to it from of old. Leave it alone; permit it, while God permits it. And so for work and hope&#x2014;else whither!</p>
<p>Poor Alick will be stirring himself to get shifted once more: I fancy his hands full. May it prove good for him, poor fellow! He has had shifting enough of late years. But he must not &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">tine</hi></foreign> [lose] heart.&#x201D; If thou <foreign>tine</foreign> heart&#x2014;the consequences are known. But we will, by God&#x2019;s blessing, all <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> and keep up our hearts, dear Mother; and so accomplish <pb id="pg-08-118" n="08:118"/>this world&#x2019;s struggle in a handsome manner. It is on the whole a despicable triviality of a struggle for a man to lose heart in: a Man,&#x2014;that was made by a God; whom God, if he call to Him, will not forsake!</p>
<p>I have thoughts of scribbling a line to Mary at Annan; but know not whether I shall make it out. Tell her of the purpose at any rate; which will be all but as good. I hope her little <foreign>lassie</foreign> is getting right again; or even <hi rend="italic">got</hi> right, since Jean does not mention it last time. You must thank James your present landlord for his beech-wood laid up to <foreign><hi rend="italic">win&#x2019;</hi></foreign> [season], and for the trouble he has taken: the Last-maker and I shall surely contrive some mould that will save me from one misery henceforth. It is a thing for which the Sultan of Turkey would think nothing to <hi rend="italic">hang</hi> two or three deacons of the Cordwainer Craft from time to time, that they pretend to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> Makers of <hi rend="italic">Shoes</hi> (that is, defences for the feet), and <hi rend="italic">are</hi> makers of torments for the feet,&#x2014;and of &#x201C;money by false pretences&#x201D;! My own lamed foot, however, is well: Shaw&#x2019;s boots saved it; tho&#x2019; they were baddish ones, and are holed already: however, I have now (when the foot is well) got another pair of shoes that I can wear.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350409-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1835-04-09">9 April</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; I send you Newspapers enough; which I do not expect to be of much use: the sending of them gives me no trouble. Stay where you are dear Mother, and enjoy yourself as long as you can. Do not sit too much in the house, but <hi rend="italic">stir</hi> almost continually. My brotherly regards to Jean and her James. Jane nearly well of her cold, or altogether well, salutes you all. God be with you, dear Mother!</p>

<p>Thanks, <salute>my kind friend,</salute> for the news you again send me. Good news, good new friends; nothing that is not good comes to me across these Waters. As if the &#x201C;golden West,&#x201D; seen by Poets, were no longer a mere optical phenomenon, but growing a reality, and coining itself into solid blessings! To me it seems very strange; as indeed generally this whole Existence here below more and more does.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-119" n="08:119"/>We have seen your Barnard: a most modest, intelligent, compact, hopeful-looking man; who will not revisit you without conquests from his Expedition hither. We expect to see much more of him; to instruct him, to learn of him: especially about that real-imaginary Locality of &#x201C;Concord,&#x201D; where a kindly-speaking Voice lives incarnated, there is much to learn.</p>
<p>That you will take to yourself a Wife is the cheerfullest tidings
you could send us.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson and Lydia Jackson were engaged on <date when="1835-01-30">30 Jan.</date>, and were to be married at Plymouth, Mass., on <date when="1835-09-14">14 Sept.</date> She was his second wife.</note> It is, in no wise, meet for man to be alone;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 2:18.</note> and indeed the beneficent Heavens, in creating Eve, did mercifully guard against that. May it prove blessed, this new arrangement! I delight to prophecy [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for you peaceful days in it; peaceful, not idle; filled rather with that best activity which is the stillest. To the future or perhaps at this hour actual Mrs Emerson, will you offer true wishes from two British Friends; who have not seen her with their eyes, but whose thoughts need not be strangers to the Home she will make for you. Nay, you add the most chivalrous summons: which who knows but one day we may actually stir ourselves to obey! It may hover for the present among the gentlest of our daydreams; mild-lustrous; an impossible possibility. May all go well with you, my worthy Countryman, kinsman, and brother Man!</p>
<p>This so astonishing reception of Teufelsdrockh in your New England circle seems to me not only astonishing, but questionable; <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, however, to be quarrelled with. I may say: If the New England cup is dangerously sweet, there are here in Old England whole antiseptic floods of good <hi rend="italic">hop</hi>-decoction; therein let it mingle; work wholesomely towards what clear benefit it can. Your young ones too, as all exaggeration is transient, and exaggerated love almost itself a blessing, will get thro&#x2019; it without damage.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written on <date when="1835-03-12">12 March</date>: &#x201C;Some thirty or more intelligent persons understand and highly appreciate the <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>. Dr. Channing sent to me for it the other day, and I have since heard that he had read it with great interest. &#x2026; The lovers of Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh here are sufficiently enthusiastic. I am an icicle to them. They think England must be blind and deaf if the Professor makes no more impression there than yet appears. I, with the most affectionate wishes for Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s fame, am mainly bent on securing the medicinal virtues of his book for my young neighbors. The good people think he overpraises Goethe. There I give him up to their wrath&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi>, pp. 119&#x2013;20).</note>&#x2014; As for Fraser, however, the idea of a New Edition is frightful to him; or rather, ludicrous, unimaginable. Of him no man has inquired for a <hi rend="italic">Sartor:</hi> in his whole wonderful world of Tory Pamphleteers, Conservative Younger-brothers, Regent-Street <pb id="pg-08-120" n="08:120"/>Loungers, Crockford Gamblers,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Crockford&#x2019;s was a club in St. James&#x2019;s St.</note> Irish Jesuits, drunken Reporters, and miscellaneous unclean persons (whom nitre and much soap will not wash clean), not a soul has expressed the smallest wish that way. He shrieks at the idea. Accordingly I realised these four Copies from, all he will surrender; and can do no more. Take them with my blessing. I beg you will present one to the honourablest of those &#x201C;honourable women&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;Nobody is coaxed to admire you, and you have won friends whom I should be proud to show you, and honorable women not a few&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi>, p. 120).</note> say to her that her (unknown) image as she reads shall be to me a bright faultless vision, textured out of mere sunbeams; to be loved and worshipped: the best of all Transatlantic Women! Do at any rate, in a more business-like style, offer my respectful regards to Dr Channing, whom certainly I could not count on for a reader, or other than a grieved condemnatory one; for I reckoned tolerance had its limits. His own faithful long-continued striving towards what is Best I knew and honoured: that he will let me go my own way thitherward, with a God-speed from him, is surely a new honour to us both.&#x2014; Finally, on behalf of the British World (which is not all contained in Fraser&#x2019;s shop) I should tell you that various persons, some of them in a dialect not to be doubted of, have privately expressed their recognition of this poor Rhapsody, the best the poor Clothes-Professor could produce in the circumstances: nay I have Scottish Presbyterian Elders who read, and thank. So true is what you say about the aptitude of all natural hearts for receiving what is from the heart spoken to them. As face answereth to face! Brother, if thou wish me to believe, do thou thyself believe first: this is as true as that of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">flere</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">dolendum;</hi></foreign><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi>, ll. 102&#x2013;3, &#x201C;<foreign>si vis me flere, dolendum est / primum ipsi tibi</foreign>&#x201D; [if you would have me weep, first feel grief yourself].</note> perhaps truer. Wherefore, putting all things together, cannot I feel that I have washed <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands of this business in a quite tolerable manner? Let a man be thankful; and on the whole <hi rend="italic">go</hi> along, while he has strength left to go.</p>
<p>This Boston <hi rend="italic">Transcendentalist</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written (<date when="1835-03-12">12 March</date>) that &#x201C;some young men proposed to issue a journal, to be called <hi rend="italic">The Transcendentalist</hi>, as the organ of a spiritual philosophy.&#x201D; In his letter of <date when="1835-04-30">30 April</date>, which Carlyle had not yet received, he suggested (with the support of F. H. Hedge who had been going to edit it) that Carlyle should come to New England to edit it (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi>, pp. 119 and 125). The journal did not materialize.</note> whatever the fate or merit of it prove to be, is surely an interesting symptom. There must be things not dreamt of, over in that Transoceanic Parish! I shall cordially wish <pb id="pg-08-121" n="08:121"/>well to this thing; and hail it as the sure forerunner of things better. The Visible becomes the Bestial when it rests not on the Invisible. Innumerable tumults of Metaphysic must be struggled thro&#x2019; (whole generations perishing by the way), and at last Transcendentalism evolve itself (if I construe aright), as the <hi rend="italic">Euthanasia</hi> of Metaphysic altogether. May it be sure, may it be speedy! Thou shalt open thy <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi>, O Son of Adam; thou shalt <hi rend="italic">look</hi>, and not forever jargon about <hi rend="italic">laws</hi> of Optics and the making of spectacles! For myself, I rejoice very much that I seem to be flinging aside innumerable sets of spectacles (Could I but <hi rend="italic">lay</hi> them aside,&#x2014;with gentleness!) and hope one day actually to see a thing or two. Man <hi rend="italic">lives</hi> by Belief<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Rom. 1:17.</note> (as it was well written of old); by Logic he can only at best long to live. Oh I am dreadfully afflicted with Logic here, and wish often (in my haste) that I had the besom of destruction<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isa. 14:23.</note> to lay to it for a little!</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">Why</hi>? and <hi rend="small-caps">Wherefore</hi>?&#x2014; God wot, simply <hi rend="small-caps">Therefore</hi>!</p>
<p>Ask not <hi rend="small-caps">Why</hi>; &#x2019;tis <hi rend="small-caps">Sith</hi> thou hast to care for<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly original, as Slater suggests, but &#x201C;why and wherefore&#x201D; sayings are proverbial.</note>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Since I wrote last to you (which seems some three months ago), there has a great mischance befallen me: the saddest, I think, of the kind called Accidents I ever had to front. By dint of continual endeavour for many weary weeks, I had got the first volume of that miserable French Revolution rather handsomely finished: from amid infinite contradictions I felt as if my head were fairly above water, and I could go on writing my poor Book, defying the Devil and the World; with a certain degree of assurance, and even of joy. A Friend borrowed this Volume of Manuscript, a kind Friend but a careless one; to write notes on it, which he was well qualified to do. One evening about two months ago, he came in on us, &#x201C;distraction (literally) in his aspect&#x201D;:<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, II ii.</note> the Manuscript, left carelessly out, had been torn up as waste paper, and all but three or four tatters was clean gone! I could not complain, or the poor man (&#x2026; )<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Slater, Carlyle wrote two sentences of four or five words each between his parentheses, and then heavily inked them over so that they cannot be read. But &#x201C;the first of these begins with a <hi rend="italic">D</hi> and ends with a question mark; the second begins with an <hi rend="italic">M</hi> which is followed,&#x201D; he believes, &#x201C;by an <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and ends with an underscored word.&#x201D; As he suggests, it is likely that Carlyle at first identified the &#x201C;poor man&#x201D; as Mill and then decided not to do so.</note> seemed as if he would have shot himself: we had to gather ourselves together, and show a smooth front to it; which happily tho<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied> difficult was not impossible <pb id="pg-08-122" n="08:122"/>to do. I began again at the beginning; to such a wretched paralysing torpedo of a task as my hand never found to do: at which I have worn myself these two months to the hue of saffron, to the humour of incipient desperation; and now, four days ago, perceiving well that I was like a man swimming in an element that grew ever rarer, till at last it became vacuum (think of that!), I with a new effort of self-denial, sealed up all the paper-fragments, and said to myself: In this mood thou makest <hi rend="italic">no</hi> way, writest <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> that requires not to be erased again; lay it by for one complete week! And so it lies, under lock and key: I have digested the whole misery; I say, If thou canst <hi rend="italic">never</hi> write this thing, why then never do write it: God&#x2019;s Universe will go along <hi rend="italic">better</hi> without it. My Belief in a Special Providence grows yearly stronger, unsubduable, impregnable: however, you see all the mad increase of entanglement I have got to strive with, and will pity me in it. Bodily exhaustion (and &#x201C;Diana in the shape of Bile&#x201D;) I will at least try to exclude from the controversy. By God&#x2019;s blessing, perhaps the Book shall yet be written; but I find it will not do, by sheer direct force; only by gentler side-methods.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This closely parallels Carlyle&#x2019;s entries, at this time, in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Early in <date when="1835-05-00">May</date></hi> (friday).&#x2014; This Note Book lying here, I may as well mark that I never, at any period of my life, felt more thoroughly disconsolate, beaten-down, powerless than now. Simply <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> it seems that I should <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> do that weariest miserablest, of tasks. &#x2026; Monday <date when="1835-05-11">11<hi rend="italic">th</hi> May</date>. With the feeling of a man swimming in a rarer and rarer element, I have persisted for some weeks; two mornings ago, with the feeling of a man swimming <foreign><hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi></foreign>, I determined to give up; to lay by my work for at least one week from this date. My will is not conquered; but my vacuum of element to swim in seems complete. In this determination too there may be instruction for me; it is the first of that kind I have deliberately formed.&#x2014; Employment for these seven days uncertain; idleness, were it possible, or productive of enjoyment and rest, would be welcomest of all. Keep up thy heart! Sterling (whom I am just going to call for) talks of Cambridge; but that will hardly do. Good were <hi rend="italic">sleep!</hi>&#x201D;</note> I have much else to write too: I feel often, as if with one year of health and peace I could write something considerable;&#x2014;the image of which sails dim and great thro&#x2019; my head. Which year of health and peace God, if He see meet, will give me yet; or withhold from me, as shall be for the best.</p>
<p>I have dwelt and swum now for about a year in this World-Mahlstrom of London; with much pain, which however has given me many thoughts, more than a counterbalance for that. Hitherto there is no outlook, but confusion darkness, innumerable things against which a man must &#x201C;set his face like a flint.&#x201D;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 50:7.</note> Madness rules the world, as it has generally done: one cannot, unhappily, without loss, say to it, Rule then; and yet must say it.&#x2014; However, in two <pb id="pg-08-123" n="08:123"/>months more I expect my good Brother from Italy (a brave fellow, who is a great comfort to me): we are then for Scotland to gather a little health, to consider ourselves a little. I must have this Book done before anything else will prosper with me.</p>
<p>Your American Pamphlets<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In His letter of <date when="1834-11-20">20 Nov. 1834</date> Emerson had said that he was sending Carlyle five articles published in American periodicals: two by Frederic Henry Hedge, two by Sampson Reed, and one which was probably a eulogy of Lafayette by Edward Everett: see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350203-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1835-02-03">3 Feb.</date></ref></note> got to hand only a few <hi rend="italic">days</hi> ago; worthy old Rich had them not originally; seemed since to have been oblivious, out of Town, perhaps unwell. I called one day, and unearthed them. Those papers you marked I have read. Genuine endeavour; which may the Heavens forward!&#x2014; In this poor Country all is swallowed up in the barren Chaos of Politics: Ministries tumbled out, Ministries tumbled in; all things (a fearful substratum of &#x201C;Ignorance and Hunger&#x201D; weltering and heaving under them<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 20.</note>) apparently in rapid progress towards&#x2014;the melting pot. There will be news from England by and by: many things have reached their term; Destiny &#x201C;with lame foot&#x201D;<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi>, III, ii, 32.</note> has overtaken them, and there will be a reckoning. Oh blessed are you where, what jargonning soever there be at Washington, the poor man (<hi rend="italic">un</hi>governed can govern himself) shoulders his axe, and walks into the Western Woods,&#x2014;sure of a nourishing Earth and an overarching Sky! It is verily the Door of Hope to distracted Europe; which otherwise I should see crumbling down into blackness of darkness.<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jude, verse 13.</note>&#x2014; That too shall be for good.</p>
<p>I wish I had anything to send you besides these four poor pamphlets; but I fear there is nothing going. Our Ex-Chancellor has been promulgating criticalities (significant as novelties, when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> with his wig and lordhood utters them) against the Aristocracy; whereat the upper Circles are terribly scandalized.<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350501-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1835-05-01">1 May</date></ref>.</note> In Literature, except a promised or obtained (but to me still unknown) Volume of Wordsworth,<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Yarrow Revisited, and Other Poems</hi> (London, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>). In his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> Carlyle records that on Sunday, <date when="1835-05-24">24 May</date>, he &#x201C;went &#x2026; with Wordsworth&#x2019;s new volume to Kensington Gardens. &#x2026; A picture of a Wren&#x2019;s Nest (two pictures of such) almost all that abides with me. A genuine, but a small, diluted man: No other thing <hi rend="italic">can</hi> I think of him. They must sing and they must say&#x2014;whatsoever seems good to them.&#x201D;</note> nothing nameworthy doing.&#x2014; Did I tell you that I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> Wordsworth this winter? Twice, at considerable length; with almost no disappointment. He is a <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> man (which means whole immensities here and <pb id="pg-08-124" n="08:124"/>now); flows like a natural well yielding mere wholesomeness,&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, as it would not but seem to me, in <hi rend="italic">small</hi> quantity, and astonishingly <hi rend="italic">diluted</hi>. Franker utterance of mere garrulities and even platitudes I never heard from any man;&#x2014;at least never, whom I could <hi rend="italic">honour</hi> for uttering them. I am thankful for Wordsworth as in great darkness, and perpetual <hi rend="italic">Skyrockets</hi> and coruscations one were, for the smallest clearburning farthing candle.&#x2014; Southey also I saw; a far <hi rend="italic">cleverer</hi> man in speech; yet a considerably smaller man. Shovelhatted; the Shovel-hat is <hi rend="italic">grown</hi> to him: one must take him as he is.</p>
<p>The second leaf is done; I must not venture on another. God bless you, my worthy Friend; you and her who is to be yours! My Wife bids me send heartiest wishes and regards from her too across the Sea. Perhaps we shall all meet one another some day&#x2014;if not Here, then Yonder!&#x2014;&#x2014;<closer><salute>Faithfully always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Hannah More&#x2019;s Books have never come; and now I begin to question whether it is not too late. If they are bought, I will still at least take a look at them: if they are not bought, pray do not buy them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1835-05-26">26 May</date>: &#x201C;Spoke of writing on Hannah More for it [<hi rend="italic">London Review</hi>]; Books have not come; so the thing is off.&#x201D; Mill sent the books, probably the <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> edition of her <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, by <date when="1835-06-01">1 June</date>, when Carlyle confirmed that he would not review them. They were reviewed in neither the <hi rend="italic">London Review</hi> nor the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>.</note></p>
<p>This is now the third week I have gone quite idle; merely reading or talking all manner of nonsense or sense I fell in with: against which state of things Conscience, like an angry scorpion, protests stinging. I have resumed that <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Sorrow; less to work at it, hitherto, than to walk thro&#x2019; it and round it, with what clearness is possible, considering how to take it up,&#x2014;or whether throwing it <hi rend="italic">down</hi>, and into the fire, one good time for all, were not the better method for it. I will do nothing rashly; but in one way or the other I must be rid of it, if I would live peaceably in this Earth. Let it not distress you. I continue to believe with the tenacity of a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Credo quia impossibile</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I believe it because it is impossible&#x201D;; cf. &#x201C;<foreign>Certum est, quia impossible</foreign>,&#x201D; Tertullian, <hi rend="italic">De Carne Christe</hi>, V.</note> that it is and will be verily all for the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-125" n="08:125"/>We have seen a good deal of Sterling<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sterling (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>) was the author of <hi rend="italic">Arthur Coningsby</hi>, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>). In his biography of Sterling, Carlyle mentions that he &#x201C;first saw&#x201D; him &#x201C;at India House &#x2026; with John Mill,&#x201D; in <date when="1835-02-00">February</date>, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XI, 105. Carlyle writes in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<date when="1835-05-26">26 May</date>): &#x201C;Hav seen a good deal of that young Clergyman (singular <hi rend="italic">Clergy</hi>man!) during these two weeks; a sanguine, light, loving man; of whom to me nothing but good seems likely to come; to himself, a <hi rend="italic">mixture</hi> (unluckily) of good and evil. He is off today; and will send me (bless him for the favour!) all the &#x2018;errors of style,&#x2019; faults &#x26;c he has to discover in <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi>. According to him I can never be popular; I can be &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;The babble of these people distracts me now and then.&#x201D;</note> since you were here; and like him very much. His name surely is Hopeful, or Hoping. We even heard him preach.</p>
<p>When is this walk to take place? I expect to be at home almost every night for some time.</p>
<p>Garnier&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Henry Garnier, from Baden, had been editor of the <hi rend="italic">Swabian Liberal</hi>, professor at the Latin College of Frebourg (presumably after <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, when the Radicals had some power), and was now a refugee from Germany probably following the repression after the unsuccessful radical attack on the Frankfurt Diet in <date when="1833-04-00">April 1833</date>.

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>I apply to you this morning for advice and help in regard to a new matter; very confident that you will put forth all your strength for me, be the result something or nothing.</p>
<p>On Saturday I accidentally heard from Molesworth that Roebuck&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-08-126" n="08:126"/>Education Committee (of which Sir W. is a member) was to meet on Tuesday (tomorrow), for the purpose of recommending &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a</hi> Commission&#x201D;: this seemed to be all that was yet fixed on; it was all at least that I could learn about it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The House of Commons had set up a Select Committee in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> and in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, in each year of which it brought forward reports: see <hi rend="italic">Parl. Papers, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date></hi> (572), IX, 1, and <hi rend="italic"><date when="1835-00-00">1835</date></hi>, (465), VII, 763. This had been done following Roebuck&#x2019;s speech on national education (<date when="1833-07-30">30 July 1833</date>) about which Mill had written enthusiastically to Carlyle on <date when="1833-08-02">2 Aug. 1833</date>, and which led to the first grants for education divided between the Church National Society and the nondenominational British and Foreign School Society. Members of this committee included Roebuck, Sir William Molesworth, and Grote. But the radicals were not the dominant party in the ministry. They were presumably in alliance with Lord Brougham, who spoke at length in the House of Lords (<date when="1835-05-21">21 May 1835</date>) seeking support for fourteen resolutions on national education, the sixth of which called for &#x201C;Seminaries&#x201D; for &#x201C;good Schoolmasters&#x201D; (i.e., for &#x201C;training colleges&#x201D; or &#x201C;normal schools&#x201D;) and the eighth for a Board of Commissioners to be responsible for them and much else as well. The debate continued on <date when="1835-06-30">30 June</date>, when Brougham withdrew the resolutions. On <date when="1835-07-03">3 July</date> he introduced a bill, in their place, for &#x201C;promoting Education and regulating Charities,&#x201D; which was not passed. Meanwhile, the Select Committee had begun meeting again on <date when="1835-06-10">10 June</date> (if it met on <date when="1835-06-02">2 June</date> it is not recorded in its report) to continue examining witnesses about the state of school education and the need for colleges for teachers, but it would have been impossible for it to recommend a new commission in Brougham&#x2019;s terms, as it was only just about to start collecting its evidence, with which it went on until <date when="1835-08-00">August</date>. In fact, no recommendation was made even then, and the committee contented itself with hoping that it would be asked to continue in being next session. It was not. Either Carlyle misunderstood the situation, or he was misinformed by the over-enthusiastic Sir William&#x2014;perhaps both. The radicals were to lose ground in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>. In <date when="1837-06-00">June 1837</date> the House of Commons adjourned directly after Brougham postponed his bill for national education. But, for the moment, Carlyle&#x2019;s enthusiasm led him to record his hopes in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<date when="1835-06-01">1 June</date>): &#x201C;Meanwhile on Saturday I hear that an Education Commission is to be appointed here: on that I would rather work, because it were surer, because it were at home. Wrote to Mill about it this morning. We will see what the issue is; then resolve for America or not. Nothing venture, nothing win. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allons!</hi></foreign>&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>You are not ignorant I think of my individual views as to that matter; my great wish to be employed in such a business; my feeling that it is almost the only business I could with perfect heartiness and any considerable appliance of faculty employ myself on here. What the nature and modes of it are I cannot pretend to know, at present, almost at all; or indeed whether my pretending to it were not a sheer solecism: so dark is my whole London environment to me; so inexperienced am I in the ways of public men and things. This only is clear to me: that there must probably be faculty in me equal to that of an average Commissioner; that I could work faithfully and even zealously in this task; finally that I have pressing need of some such <pb id="pg-08-127" n="08:127"/>task here,&#x2014;and indeed, if I find none such, am not without serious thoughts of <hi rend="italic">bundling</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Packing up before a journey.</note> and trying other climates and other circumstances. This last point I will explain when we meet.</p>
<p>What then can you do? Perhaps you might go to Roebuck, or to whoever else is suitable in your circle, and ascertain two things: what the precise nature of this appointment of Education Commissioner will be, the duties expected &#x26;c &#x26;c; secondly the mode of nominating to it, by whom, on what grounds and the like.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brougham&#x2019;s bill recommended six commissioners, three of whom were to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi></foreign> members of the ministry and three either barristers or serjeants. Carlyle&#x2019;s candidacy was never really in question.</note> This once clear to you, the whole would be moderately clear: you know me pretty well, and knowing this thing pretty well, you could bring us in apposition, see how we suited.&#x2014; I have mentioned the matter to Charles Buller only; who engages with great readiness to do all he can for me (speak to Lord John Russel<supplied>[l]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home Secretary and a member of Roebuck&#x2019;s committee.</note> in my behalf); and is meanwhile charged like you to gather knowledge about the thing, and give me advice. I shall probably see him on Thursday night (when you too I think are to be there): but whether we shall have time to speak of that is not very certain for that occasion.</p>
<p>I write in great haste; but I daresay you make out what I mean: pray turn it over in your mind, and let me have it back from you in a more organic shape. As Napoleon says I find myself &#x201C;in a new position,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced. But cf. Gwilym O. Griffith, <hi rend="italic">Mazzini: Prophet of Modern Europe</hi> (London, <date when="1932-00-00">1932</date>), p. 136, where Carlyle is described as recalling, about <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>, that &#x201C;the Emperor once said, &#x2018;<foreign>je me trouve dans une fausse position</foreign>&#x2019;&#x2014;and improvises upon it for half an hour on end.&#x201D;</note> and am not the expertest in changing positions: however, the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> position <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be changed, do it as I may. Help me, my good friends!</p>
<p>Can you come hither on Wednesday night? We are to be at home.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Ever faithfully,</salute></closer></p>

The Book is of that species that threatens one reading it with locked-jaw: yet we have three Editions. Fearful and wonderful!</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>As I shall probably have a chance for a frank tonight, and am not likely to do much good at working for the present, I propose paying off some epistolary debts, and send you in the first place a little hint of our welfare, and way of procedure. Alick has written us a Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> which came yesterday; assuring us of your continuance in moderate health, which was the best news we could get out of Scotland. They are all flitting and bestirring themselves, jumping hither and thither; it is now just about a year since we were at the same work: people have many <foreign><hi rend="italic">fitches</hi></foreign> (as I once told Jemmy Bretton) &#x201C;before they get to the <hi rend="italic">crown-head&#x201D;!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Fitch&#x201D; and &#x201C;crown-head&#x201D;: moves at draughts (Scots). Jemmy Bretton is possibly &#x201C;Canny&#x201D; Bretton (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300928-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:167</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1838-09-28">28 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>).</note> Let us all be grateful that we have still some <pb id="pg-08-129" n="08:129"/>strength to carry us on, and are not deserted of Hope, and even of Guidance if we will ask it well.</p>
<p>Last time I wrote, you heard that I had laid by my work for two weeks: I have taken it out again since that, but have been making (at least so far as <hi rend="italic">black on white</hi> goes) very small way in it. I have had such a long spell at the business, and then was so tumbled over head in that sorrowful loss of the Manuscript, I feel as if there were nothing more profitable for me than to rest a while, and gather new <foreign><hi rend="italic">smeddum</hi></foreign> [spirit] for assaulting it again under better omens. Not much will be done, I think, till after I have seen you in Annandale. I have great doubts about many things connected with this Book of mine, and Books in general; for all is in the uttermost confusion in that line of business here: but, God be thanked, I have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> doubts about my course of duty in the world; or that if I am driven back at one door, I must go on trying at another. There are some two or even three outlooks opening on me, unconnected with Books, about which I cannot write to you yet with any distinctness: one of these regards the business of National Education, which the Parliament is now busy upon, in which I mean to try all my strength to get something to do (for my conscience greatly approves of the work as useful); whether I shall succeed herein or not I cannot with the smallest accuracy guess as yet. Another outlook invites my consideration from America: I have another long Letter from Emerson, and plenty of Yankee good-wishes, and a project chalked out for passing a winter over the water, and <hi rend="italic">lecturing</hi> there!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1835-04-30">30 April</date> contained precise information about travel and living expenses, and the possible costs and profits of lectures in New England. Progress in writing was so bad that Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<date when="1835-05-26">26 May</date>): &#x201C;The Book (The poor Book!) can make no progress at all. &#x2026; Suppose that we did throw it by? It is not by paper alone that man lives. If I could get the first volume finished (in any way), and print it, and to America before winter; and wash my hands of it! My bodily health is actually very <hi rend="italic">bad</hi>.&#x201D;</note> Something or other we shall devise: in the mean time I let it all lie round me shaping itself; and shall probably have fixed on nothing till after we meet, and have a <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> together, and get the thing all <hi rend="italic">summered and wintered</hi> talking together freely once more. It is an awful Distraction this huge Babylon of a City; and yet there are many kind persons and circumstances in it; and I do not doubt I have gained much instruction, correction and profit in it, during this twelvemonth; and behold still, thy servant is <hi rend="italic">here</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Sam. 3:4&#x2013;10.</note> ready and disposed to do the best he can!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-130" n="08:130"/>Mrs Austin, who went away some two months ago,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Hastings, but they were soon to move to Boulogne for a year.</note> writes to us yesterday in very bad spirits, that her Husband, poor man, is no better, is even sicker for the time. We are very sorry for her, very sorry for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>,&#x2014;who is one of the faithfullest men living, but driven almost desperate by the <hi rend="italic">lying</hi> dishonest world he has had to live in. One <hi rend="italic">should</hi> not be driven desperate (for this is the place of <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>); yet a man may easily be excused sometimes for going that way.</p>
<p>A new young figure, and with him a new family of acquaintances have risen on us: the young man is very clever, and true and kind-hearted; his name is John Sterling: he has written a very superior Book (some years ago); and strangest of all, is a Clergyman of the English Church.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350527-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1835-05-27">27 May</date>]</ref>.</note> His Mother<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hester Sterling (<foreign>n&#xE9;e</foreign> Coningham or Cunningham) (d. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>).</note> and Jane are about &#x201C;sweering [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] an eternal friendship&#x201D;: John himself sent me the other day three full sheets and a cover, of criticism on Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh; expressing amazement, admiration, horror&#x2014;all in sufficient quantity. I really like the youth rather; and shall rejoice when he comes to London permanently (for as yet he resides in the country and only his people are here).</p>
<p>Mrs Montague made out her call to us some days ago: after waiting one complete year! Nothing can look more sorrowful to my mind than that really distinguished Lady now does: a woman with high aspirings and faculty, who built her house <hi rend="italic">on the sand</hi>,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 7:26.</note> and has now seen it <hi rend="italic">tumble</hi>. The truth was not in her;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 John 2:4.</note> and now in her old days she feels the curse that ever attends that. I have no wish to have any farther trade with her or hers, except in the way of quite distant civility. The Truthless are a class of creatures from whom no man can extract profit.</p>
<p>Tonight we are invited to see the great Agitator O&#x2019;Connell!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel O&#x2019;Connell (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), Irish leader, MP for Dublin, at this time in uneasy alliance with the radicals.</note> Unless it be wet, we mean to go: it is at Mrs Bullers; one of the meetings called a <hi rend="italic">rout</hi>, or huge multitude of people all elbowing one another. You shall hear of it on the cover,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No cover extant.</note> dear Mother; for I hope to send you a few finishing words tomorrow. <closer><salute>My blessings till then!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came yesterday, with the good news at least that you were safe, and getting nestled in your new habitation; where, if prayers of mine could prevail, a cheerfuller course of exertion would wait you than late years have offered. What chopping and changing! Shifting from trouble to trouble, and from side to side! It is the lot that has been appointed us; with which it were no wisdom to get into bad humour; unwise even to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> much of it at all. I remembered you here on Whitsunday, and wished you soft progress: it was a wettish day with us, but I hoped you might have it sunnier.</p>
<p>And so Catlinns and all its <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud] lies behind you; and a new scene opens before you, or rather, alas, lies <hi rend="italic">shut</hi> as yet, and only promises to open. Come of it what may, I cannot regret that you have quitted that unthankful spot, where your labour had no joyfulness, no tolerable prospect of bringing fruit. You are settled there, and can, with no great expense, and in a fair position, survey what lies about you, and even if <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> offer, <hi rend="italic">know</hi> at least that nothing offers. God&#x2019;s Creation does not end at the Solway Frith; neither can the man that will work wisely be always foiled. If our work yield no produce, it is the clearest sign that it was <hi rend="italic">unwise</hi>; and we should descend into ourselves, and see whether the fault (perhaps cunningly hid as some kind of virtue) lay not <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. My grand advice is, keep your mind calm, unexasperated, clear! <hi rend="italic">Do faithfully</hi> whatsoever your hand findeth to do.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 9:10.</note> This is always possible for us; in this there is always <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> hope. For if it is written (and too often verified with us) that &#x201C;the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong,&#x201D; it is likewise true that &#x201C;time and chance happen unto <hi rend="italic">all</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 9:11 for both quotations.</note> Be sure therefore that opportunities <hi rend="italic">will</hi> offer; that if you be wise to seize them, they will bear you along.</p>
<p>I know not, my dear Brother, whether these reflexions are of any value to you, or indeed whether you are not of yourself too prone to indulge in the like: I can know only with entire clearness at this distance that my brotherly sympathy is strong with you; that my hope <pb id="pg-08-132" n="08:132"/>too is strong; that if all these disappointments <hi rend="italic">teach</hi> us, they will have been well worth enduring.</p>
<p>I remember your neighbourhood very clearly from of old: but cannot get up any clear recollection of the particular house you are in. This is of the less moment, since we can hope (before you are well settled) to see it with our eyes; and hear all your circumstances freely described by word of mouth. We shall have much to communicate; advices may circulate among us; and if not much mutual <hi rend="italic">light</hi>, yet sympathy and wishes, which are mutual <hi rend="italic">strength</hi>.</p>
<p>You know that of Cattle-jobbing; and dislike it, I believe, as much as I. Yet it is hard for a man to be idle, to feel that he is doing nothing. My advice therefore were: Do this thing, if you feel that you should do it, with caution, with wisdom. Avoid, above all earthly things, the qualities that you know to be <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> in jobbing. If I have ever had any fear for you, my good Brother, it was simply that your own mind might fail you, might slide down by the very course these men too generally follow. God of his great mercy forbid! But I have felt that such fears were but proof of my own dispiritment, were unworthy of you, of your Father&#x2019;s son.&#x2014; I speak in the dark about all this, and give evidence only of my brotherly perennial regard for you.</p>
<p>With myself here things go not the brightest course: that lost <hi rend="italic">Manuscript</hi> cannot be finished for the present; I have worn out my spirits somewhat with long toil at it, and feel that before going much farther I should <supplied>[at least h]</supplied>ave a <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>. There are some schemes in the wind (mentioned <supplied>[in our]</supplied> Mother&#x2019;s Letter): one of them even connects itself with America. But, as I said, you will likely see me before anything is fixed on. I have yet heard no new word from Jack; but trust if all have gone well, that in a week or two we may hear.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother! Jane sends you her true sisterly wishes: our love to your little <foreign>bairns</foreign> and their Mother. May God keep you always!</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother,&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Excuse this brevity my dear Alick; I feel as if it were of no use writing, when one has the hope of so soon meeting. I long much to see poor Jack safe here, and be off&#x2014;say 6 weeks hence!</p>
<p>As to Harry, our hope was that he might <supplied>[have car]</supplied>ried my Mother while he had any strength, and so his old days have been peaceable. Certainly do not sell the poor Beast; not at least till we come: his last strength was given to us; we are bound to provide that his end be not <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi>.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>Alick, writing to me yesterday, mentions among other things, that you are <hi rend="italic">shorted</hi> [annoyed] (as he phrases it) because I have not written.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet had written to Carlyle on <date when="1835-04-13">13 April</date>. After giving various bits of news about the family, she had said: &#x201C;I hope you will write me a long letter soon and give me some good advices I know you are very busy at present but you can soon write a long sheet.&#x201D; Though Carlyle calls her &#x201C;<foreign>bairn</foreign>&#x201D; she was nearly 22 and would marry Robert Hanning in <date when="1836-03-00">March 1836</date>.</note> Can it be possible your good little heart has got so far out of its right movement as to be <hi rend="italic">angry at me!</hi> I do not believe a word of it. The utmost is (and this I had overlooked), you feel that your sisterly love was clear and entire towards me; that I, by not writing expressly on the matter, have as good as slighted it as of no account. Dear little Jenny! it is not unnatural, but perfectly erroneous. Young woman was never farther <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>. As you would <hi rend="italic">know</hi>, were you here with your own eyes to see. My dear Sister, let no such now or henceforth enter your kind little heart. Depend upon it, su<supplied>[ch]</supplied> come of the Devil (tho&#x2019; in a disguised shape), and ought <supplied>[to be]</supplied> dismissed back to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.</p>
<p>I have a kind of headache, and cannot wr<supplied>[ite]</supplied> farther to you today. It would give me very great sa<supplied>[tis]</supplied>faction indeed to know accurately what you are abou<supplied>[t]</supplied> and how you go on. I hope to see farther and clearlier into it all, when I come back; which, tho&#x2019; the Dr has not written yet, I trust will not be distant now. Alick says you are going to the Dumfries Schools again over summer; a step he seems not to be very sure of. Certainly, if you hope to <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> something that will <supplied>[be]</supplied> profitable, there is nothing more adviseable than to go. Nothing that a human creature can do is at <supplied>[all]</supplied> times so inevitably right as to <hi rend="italic">learn something</hi>. <supplied>[There]</supplied>fore go, my dear Jenny, if it so seem to thee.</p>
<p>Alick says there has been some sort of dispute between Jean&#x2019;s people and Uncle John,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Uncle John&#x201D; is John Aitken, brother of Carlyle&#x2019;s mother.</note> and that my Mother had an opportunity of <hi rend="italic">delivering</hi> herself of that accusation she has long harboured against the unjust Uncle. <hi rend="italic">Her</hi> grievance seemed to me always indisputably well founded; and I am glad she has, one good time, got it uttered. For the rest, let us trust the dispute will assuage itself, and no wrong <pb id="pg-08-134" n="08:134"/>be done to either party. Wrath is a thing that comes <hi rend="italic">not</hi> from Heaven; tho&#x2019; unluckily, among fallen mortals, it will sometimes arise. Remember me to Jean and James when you see them: I trust I am not in their debt as to Letters; at all events, tell them that if they <hi rend="italic">shorten</hi> upon me, it will be the greatest injustice ever done to any man. And do not you <hi rend="italic">shorten</hi>, my dear little <foreign>Bairn</foreign>; but <hi rend="italic">lengthen</hi>, and know that if you take anything amiss, it is for mere want of seeing how it really was; that of all delusions Satan could tempt you with, that of wanting my brotherly affection, now and always while we inhabit the Earth together, is the most delusive. Oh that is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> true, and never can be.&#x2014; Finally my dear Jenny I must for this brief time be going. Keep diligent, cheerful, ready to improve the passing hour, and make the most and best of it. Jane sends you her true love. <closer><salute>May all Good be with you always! Your affectionate Brother,&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>

<salute>My Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>I said to Mill the other day that your Name was <hi rend="small-caps">hopeful</hi>; of which truth surely this copious refreshing shower of really kind and genial criticism you have bestowed on the hardened, kiln-burnt, altogether contradictory Professor Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh, is new proof.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle notes in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1835-06-01">1 June</date>. &#x201C;Letter from John Sterling criticising <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k; the spirit of it, the language of it: some truth in the censure; to which I have replied in friendly temper. <hi rend="italic">Another</hi> letter from him yesterday in enforcement of his views (on style): <foreign><hi rend="italic">das wirds zu lang</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">:</hi> I made it into matches.&#x201D; The surviving letter of <date when="1835-05-29">29 May</date> was published with omissions in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XI, 108&#x2013;17; and in Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 307&#x2013;16. On its envelope Carlyle wrote: &#x201C;[follows Dissert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on <hi rend="italic">Sartor:</hi> see].&#x201D;</note> Greater faith I have not found in Israel!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 7:9.</note> Neither here shall faith and hope wholly fail: know, my Friend that your shower does not fall as on mere barren bricks, like water spilt on the ground; that I take it hopefully in, with great desire (knowing what spirit it is of) to <hi rend="italic">assimilate</hi> such portion of it as the nature of things will allow. So much, on this sheet, I must announce to you, were it at full gallop, and in the most imperfect words.</p>
<p>Your objections as to phraseology and style have good grounds to <pb id="pg-08-135" n="08:135"/>stand on; many of them indeed are considerations to which I myself was not blind; which there (unluckily) were no means of doing more than nodding to as one passed. A man has but a certain strength; imperfections cling to him, which if he wait till he have brushed off entirely, he will spin forever on his axis, advancing nowhither. Know thy thought, <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> it; front Heaven and Earth with it,&#x2014;in whatsoever <hi rend="italic">words</hi> Nature and Art have made readiest for thee! If one has thoughts not hitherto uttered in English Books, I see nothing for it but that you must use words not found there, must <hi rend="italic">make</hi> words,&#x2014;with moderation and discretion, of course. That I have not always done it <hi rend="italic">so</hi>, proves only that I was not strong enough; an accusation to which I for one will never plead not guilty. For the rest, pray that I may have more and more strength! Surely too, as I said, all these <hi rend="italic">coal-marks</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Black marks of censure.</note> of yours shall be duly considered, for the first and even for the second time, and help me on my way. With unspeakable cheerfulness I give up <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Talented&#x201D;:</hi> indeed, but for the plain statement you make, I could have sworn such word had never, except for parodistic ironical purposes, risen from my inkhorn, or passed my lips. Too much evil can hardly be said of <hi rend="italic">it:</hi> while speech of it at all is necessary.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had written: &#x201C;A good deal &#x2026; is positively barbarous,&#x201D; especially objecting to &#x201C;&#x2018;talented,&#x2019; a mere newspaper and hustings word, invented, I believe, by O&#x2019;Connell&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XI, 110&#x2013;11). &#x201C;Talented&#x201D; in the sense of &#x201C;gifted&#x201D; was not, in fact, a recent coinage. Carlyle had been reading Coleridge&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Table Talk</hi> (see <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1835-05-26">26 May</date>) and might have seen Coleridge&#x2019;s strictures on &#x201C;that vile and barbarous vocable <hi rend="italic">talented</hi>, stealing out of the newspapers into the leading reviews and most respectable publications of the day. Why not shillinged, farthinged, tenpenced &#x26;c?&#x201D; <date when="1832-07-08">8 July, 1832</date>: see <hi rend="italic">Specimens of Table Talk of the late Samuel Taylor Coleridge</hi> (London, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), II, 63.</note>&#x2014; But finally do you reckon this really a time for Purism of Style; or that Style (mere dictionary style) has much to do with the worth or unworth of a Book? I do not: with whole ragged battallions of Scott&#x2019;s-Novel Scotch, with Irish, German, French and even Newspaper Cockney (when &#x201C;Literature&#x201D; is little other than a Newspaper) storming in on us, and the whole structure of our Johnsonian English breaking up from its foundations,&#x2014;revolution <hi rend="italic">there</hi> as visible as anywhere else!</p>
<p>You ask, How it comes that none of the &#x201C;leading minds&#x201D; of this country (if one knew where to find them) have given the Clothes-Philosophy any response?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had asked: &#x201C;How then comes it, we cannot but ask, that these ideas, displayed assuredly with no want of eloquence, vivacity or earnestness, have found, unless I am much mistaken, so little acceptance among the best and most energetic minds in this country?&#x201D;</note> Why, my good friend, not one of them has <pb id="pg-08-136" n="08:136"/>had the happiness of seeing it!

How it chanced that no Bookseller would print it (in an epoch when Satan Montgomery runs or seems to run thro&#x2019; thirteen editions),<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Montgomery (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>), poet and author of religious poems such as <hi rend="italic">The Omnipresence of the Deity</hi> (London, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Satan</hi> (London, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), extravagantly overpraised in the press, notoriously reprinted in many editions, and severely criticized by Macaulay in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, LI (<date when="1830-04-00">April 1830</date>), 193-210.</note> and the Morning Papers (on its issuing thro&#x2019; the <foreign><hi rend="italic">cloaca</hi></foreign>) sang together in mere discord over such a Creation: this truly is a question, but a different one. Meanwhile, do not suppose the poor Book has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been responded to; for the historical fact is, I could show very curious response to it here; not ungratifying, and fully three times as much as I counted on, as the wretched farrago itself deserved.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No doubt Carlyle is referring to Emerson&#x2019;s letters of <date when="1835-03-12">12 March</date> and <date when="1835-04-30">30 April</date> recording the enthusiasm with which <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> was being received in New England. Emerson had told Carlyle that &#x201C;George Ripley, having heard, through your letter to me, that nobody in England had responded to the <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, had secretly written you a most reverential letter.&#x201D; (<date when="1835-04-30">30 April</date>, Slater, p. 126). The letter was not sent until <date when="1835-06-01">1 June</date>. See Slater, &#x201C;George Ripley and Thomas Carlyle,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi>, LXVII (<date when="1952-06-00">June 1952</date>), 341&#x2013;44, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350810-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-08-10">10 Aug.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>You say finally, as the Key to the whole mystery, that Teufelsdrockh does not believe in a &#x201C;personal God.&#x201D; It is frankly said, with a friendly honesty for which I love you. A grave charge nevertheless, an <hi rend="italic">awful</hi> charge: to which, if I mistake not, the Professor laying his hand on his heart will reply with some gesture expressing the solemnest <hi rend="italic">denial</hi>. In gesture, rather than in speech; for &#x201C;the Highest <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be spoken of in words.&#x201D; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Personal</hi>,&#x201D; impersonal.&#x201D; One, Three, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> meaning can any mortal (after all) attach to them in reference to <hi rend="italic">such</hi> an object? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wer darf ihn</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">nennen</hi></foreign><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Attributed to Goethe; see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 307.</note> [Who dares name him]? I dare not, and do not. That you dare and do (to some greater extent) is a matter I am far from taking offence at: nay, with all sincerity, I can rejoice that you have a creed of that kind, which gives you happy thoughts, nerves you for good actions, brings you into readier communion with many good men; my true wish is that such creed may long hold compactly together in you, and be &#x201C;a covert from the heat, a shelter from the storm, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 32:2.</note> Well is <pb id="pg-08-137" n="08:137"/>it if we have a printed Litany to pray from; and yet not ill if we <hi rend="italic">can</hi> pray even in <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi>, for Silence too is audible <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. Finally assure yourself I am neither Pagan nor Turk, nor circumcised Jew, but an unfortunate Christian individual resident at Chelsea in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> year of Grace; neither Pantheist nor Pottheist, nor any Theist or <hi rend="italic">ist</hi> whatsoever; having the most decided contem<supplied>[pt]</supplied> for all manner of System-builders and Sectfounders&#x2014;as far as contempt may be com<supplied>[patible]</supplied> with so mild a nature; feeling well beforehand (taught by long experience) that all such are and even must be <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle left out several passages from Sterling&#x2019;s letter in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi>, which carried the argument home to him even more strongly. For Sterling wrote as a committed Christian who objected that Carlyle&#x2019;s, or Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh&#x2019;s, conception of divinity was &#x201C;of a high inscrutable Necessity. &#x2026; On the other hand, I affirm, We do know whence we come &#x26; whither we go&#x2014; We are raised out of the blindness of Hades by the informing breath of an Absolute &#x26; Loving Source of Life.&#x201D; He speaks of Teufeldr&#xF6;ckh&#x2019;s faith as a mere &#x201C;Pantheistic creed,&#x201D; which may lead only to the &#x201C;barren exercise of Understanding, or &#x2026; restless &#x26; agonising self-contradiction. &#x2026; Similar seems to me the case of your hero; &#x26; thus I explain to myself his selfimposed &#x26; futile solitude, &#x26; the turbulent disease of heart which he was perpetually seek<supplied>[ing]</supplied> to account for by something in the aspect of the world &#x26; the state of society instead of looking into himself for the root of the malady, &#x26; out of himself to God for the remedy.&#x201D; Sterling, in short, still believes in &#x201C;the Preachi<supplied>[n]</supplied>g of God as the Father &#x26; Xt as the Redeemer.&#x201D;<lb/><lb/>
Towards the end of the letter Sterling also criticizes Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh and his creator in a passage not previously published. He returns to their &#x201C;peculiarities of style&#x201D;: &#x201C;The headlong accumulation the crowded &#x26; fantastic imagery are modes of utterance which spring from the writers fervent &#x26; strong subjectivity without reference to the receptive power of the reader from whom the author feels himself aloof &#x26; divided. In the same way arises all that want of a sufficient proportion &#x26; balance of the common &#x26; familiar; &#x26; thus too the lawless defiance of the usages of men as to language&#x2014;which is always strange &#x26; often anomalous. The language of a country &#x26; generation is the expression of its life. A writer who has no sympathy with this life, but moulds his own being in a separate sphere, proclaims by his foreign speech the want of that base of mutual feeling between himself &#x26; his age &#x26; country, which well-nigh assures his own impotence for producing any deep widespread result.&#x201D;</note> By God&#x2019;s blessing, one has got two eyes to look with; also a mind capable of knowing, of believing: that is all the creed I will at this time insist on. And now may I beg one thing: that wherever in my thoughts or your own you fall on any dogma that tends to estrange you from me, pray believe <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">false</hi>;&#x2014;false as Beelzebub, till you get clearer evidence.</p>
<p>However, descending from the Empyrean to London pavements, let me tell you that I am actually bestirring myself to try whether the people will give me any employment in this matter of National Education. Mill and some others undertake to help me, but have not reported <pb id="pg-08-138" n="08:138"/>yet. It is a confused business; out of which darkness is rayed forth on me hitherto. If we fail in it, there is some likelihood I may cross the Atlantic soon. The Book-Trade seems to me <hi rend="italic">done</hi> here: a man must go where his work lies, where they will keep him in existence for his work.</p>
<p>Your good Mother shocked us a little by the news that <hi rend="italic">your</hi> return hither was uncertain. We will still hope to see you ere long. May you come for the better not for the worse when you do come! That is very sincerely my prayer; for I do believe you to be a very honest fellow; and, alas, I have never known Destiny too kind to such. God bless you and guide you! <closer><salute>I remain always&#x2014; Your&#x2019;s with great sincerity,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>You did kindly to send the little separate note:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found. The note had come with Sterling&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1835-05-29">29 May</date>.</note> the least bit &#x201C;all to myself,&#x201D; (as the children say) was sure to give me a livelier pleasure, than any number of sheets in which I had but a secondary interest. For in spite of the honestest efforts to annihilate my <hi rend="italic">I-ity</hi>, or merge it in what the world doubtless considers my better half; I still find myself a self-subsisting and alas! selfseeking <hi rend="italic">Me</hi>. Little Felix, in the Wanderjahre, when, in the midst of an animated scene between Whilelm [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and Theresa, he pulls Theresa&#x2019;s gown, and calls out, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Mama Theresa I too am here!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Carlyle&#x2019;s translation, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 123. For <hi rend="italic">I-ety</hi>, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:88</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> only speaks out with the charming trustfulness of a child, what I am perpetually feeling, tho too sophisticated to pull peoples skirts, or exclaim in so many words; Mr Sterling &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> too am here.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But I must tell you, I find a grave fault in that note about the last fault I should have dreamt of finding in any utterance of yours: it is not believing but faithless! In the first place the parenthesis &#x201C;(if ever)&#x201D; seems to me a wilful questioning of the goodness of Providence. Then you say; if in some weeks I can bring myself to think of you with patience perhaps &#x26;c&#x2014;now both the &#x201C;if&#x201D; and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi>&#x201D; displease <pb id="pg-08-139" n="08:139"/>me. Only the most inveterate Sceptic could, with your fineness of observation, have known me for two weeks, without certifying himself that my patience is infinite, inexhaustible! that in fact I, as well as yourself combine &#x201C;the wisdom of Solomon with the patience of Job.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Kings 10:4 and James 5:11.</note></p>
<p>Far from being offended by your des<supplied>[s]</supplied>ertation on the Sartor<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Herstmonceux, <date when="1835-05-29">29 May, 1835</date> (<hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi>, ed<hi rend="italic">n</hi> <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>, p. 274 <supplied>[)]</supplied>&#x201D;: (TC&#x2019;s note). Cf. <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XI, 108&#x2013;17, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June</date></ref>.</note> I think it the best that has been said or sung of him. even where your criticism does not quite fall in with my humble views, I still love the spirit of the critic. For instance, I am loth to believe that I have married a Pagan,&#x2014;but I approve entirely of the warmth with which you warn your Friend against the delusion of burning pastils before a statue of Jupiter and such like extravagancies.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane may have been referring to something in the lost, burnt letter from Sterling, see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June</date></ref>. But she may equally well have had in mind Sterling&#x2019;s implied comparisons between Carlyle&#x2019;s beliefs and those of the great pagans, who had no general love for humanity, as in his remark: &#x201C;What a proof of this is afforded by the history of Slavery &#x26; of the ancient opinions about it even of a Plato and Aristotle!&#x201D;</note> I suppose it is excessively heterodox and in a catholic country I should be burnt for it, but to you I may safely confess that I care almost nothing about <hi rend="italic">what</hi> a man believes, in comparison with <hi rend="italic">how</hi> he believes. If his belief be correct, it is so much the better for himself; but its intensity, its efficacy is the ground on which I love and trust him. Thus you see I am capable of appreciating your fervour in behalf of the thirtynine articles, without being afflicted because my Husband is accused of contumacy against them.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had been ordained deacon, but not priest, on Trinity Sunday, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, which was to Carlyle a &#x201C;clerical aberration.&#x201D; Always concerned about the grounds of his belief, he had lent Carlyle his friend F. D. Maurice&#x2019;s booklet <hi rend="italic">Subscription No Bondage, or the Practical Advantages afforded by the Thirty-Nine Articles as Guides in all the Branches of Academical Education</hi> (Oxford, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>). Published anonymously, as by &#x201C;Rusticus,&#x201D; it was Maurice&#x2019;s first theological work, and about the admission of dissenters to Oxford. Carlyle made light of it all; but &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">what</hi> a man believes&#x201D; was to remain a major issue when Sterling&#x2019;s biography was written first by Julius Charles Hare in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>, and then by Carlyle. The conflict between Coleridgean Anglicanism and Carlyle&#x2019;s liberal Christian heterodoxy was already apparent. Carlyle returned the book next day, and confided to his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<date when="1835-05-26">26 May</date>) that he had a long talk with Sterling about this &#x201C;Pamphlet, by one Morris [Maurice] (as I discovered) on signing the Thirty-Nine Articles. What have I to do with that? An earnest man&#x2019;s earnest word was worth reading: my verdict lay in those four lines of jingle; which I, virtuously, spared Sterling the sight of:<lb/><lb/>
<lg><l>Thirty-nine English Articles,</l><lb/>
<l>Ye wondrous little particles,</l><lb/>
<l>Did God shape his Universe really by <hi rend="italic">you?</hi></l><lb/>
<l>In that case, I swear it,</l><lb/>
<l>And solemnly declare it,</l><lb/>
<l>This logic of M&#x2014;&#x2014;s&#x2019;s is true.&#x201D;</l></lg><lb/><lb/>
The difference was more difficult to elucidate because neither Sterling nor Maurice believed in the literal truth of the Articles, but Jane echoes Carlyle&#x2019;s mockery which he more considerately kept to his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-140" n="08:140"/>But what do you mean by speaking of &#x201C;a few weeks&#x201D;! When you went, you said, with an <hi rend="italic">appearance</hi> at least of good faith, that you would be back in London&#x2014;in three weeks: And one week and half of another is already gone.</p>
<p>I hope you will keep your time for several reasons; chiefly for this one, that our continuance in London has of late days become more uncertain, the America speculation having suddenly received a more practical form; and if we depart for Scotland without seeing you any more, and afterwards our good or evil star actually shoots over the Atlantic; surely to some of us at least it will <supplied>[be]</supplied> a matter of regret rather than of self congratulation that our acquaintance should have begun.</p>
<p>I have seen your Mother twice, she is very good to me. I have moreover been reviving one of my young-lady-accomplishments for her sake, painting flowers on a portfolio, to keep those verses in which she was so troubled about losing<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>Your Father has been here since I began writing, to ask us to dinner on Saturday&#x2014; We played a <hi rend="italic">drawn</hi> game at chess, and Carlyle and he debated more loudly than logically on the subject of Napoleon&#x2019;s morality. He is just gone to inquire about the house in Cheyne Walk,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling had returned to Herstmonceux; but, since he had given up his curacy there in <date when="1835-02-00">February</date> because of ill-health, he needed a house for himself and family in London, where he was to return in the autumn.</note> in which good work I was meaning to have forestalled him and communicated the result in my letter. If a Fairy would gran<supplied>[t]</supplied> me three wishes this evening; my first would be that we might remain where we are, my second that you might be settled in Cheyne Walk, and the third like a thrifty Scotch woman I would beg leave to lay by in reserve for future need.</p>
<p>And now I must go and array myself with all possible splendour for a rout at M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Bullers, where O&#x2019;Conell [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] is to be and all the earth that is to say all the radical earth. Wish me good speed&#x2014; May I offer my good wishes and prospective regards to your wife?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1830-11-02">2 Nov. 1830</date>, Sterling had married Susannah Barton (d. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), sister of his Cambridge friend and fellow &#x201C;Apostle&#x201D; Charles Barton. Their sister Anna was to marry Frederick Denison Maurice on <date when="1837-10-07">7 Oct. 1837</date>, with Sterling as the officiating clergyman.</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept kind thanks from both of us for the volume you have sent my Wife. We are glad to see the <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi> in a new shape promising more of permanency.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the first bound volume of <hi rend="italic">Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s London Journal</hi>, a weekly, which had started on <date when="1834-04-02">2 April 1834</date>. It merged with the <hi rend="italic">Printing Machine</hi> on <date when="1835-06-06">6 June</date>, and continued as <hi rend="italic">Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s London Journal and Printing Machine</hi> until <date when="1835-12-26">26 Dec. 1835</date>.</note> One may hope that at a future epoch some fit eye searching for what was good and graceful in an age where so very much was the reverse, may find something here to dwell upon and treasure.</p>
<p>I am afraid you take too much trouble about that <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>. As hinted today, I have now generally another Newspaper which I can address to Scotland; and that was mainly the thing I wanted. For my own share, Fonblanque has lost nine tenths of his worth now when he is to be read not at Craigenputtoch but at Chelsea.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Albany Fonblanque (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>), editor of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>.</note></p>
<p>You would far misconstrue us both if you supposed that our natural regret at your temporary cessation of visits, had ended or was like to end, in irritation, suspicion or other unworthy humour. I can fancy causes enough of the phenomenon without implying disregard, or even diminution of regard on your part. Much must and should in all such cases be left to individual determination, grounded on such insight as is to be had. <closer><salute>To me two things only are clear: that there is no <pb id="pg-08-142" n="08:142"/>man in London I like better to commune with from time to time; and that seen or unseen, I can feel nothing towards you but esteem and goodwill, and am and remain,</salute></closer></p>

He has come from beyond the Atlantic; wishes to see, in passing, our Scottish Arcadia such as it is: Abbotsford, Yarrow water, the Bush aboon Traquair<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A song by Robert Crawford first published in Ramsay&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tea-Table Miscellany</hi> (<date when="1723-00-00">1723</date>), referring to birch trees above Traquair, E.

<p>We are to be in Scotland again ere long; and hope it may be within the Chapter of lucky Chances that our way and yours may intersect there. Mrs Carlyle joins with me in kindest good wishes.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
<p>Let me present to you a new friend of mine, well recommended from beyond the waters, and of a pleasant quality in himself: Mr. Henry Barnard, from Connecticut, New England. When he visits Glasgow will you explain to him a little what he has to see; give him furtherance and welcome such as a stranger needs and merits?</p>
<p>I have never yet seen your worthy Brother,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William J. Hope. Carlyle had met him one winter in Edinburgh (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341219-TC-DH-01"><sic>7:346</sic><corr>TC to DH, <date when="1834-12-19">19 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>), possibly of <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1810-00-00">10</date> when Carlyle was beginning at university, and a William Hope is recorded in philosophy and literature.

I shall hear of you, perhaps see you, in Annandale, where we hope ere long to be.</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>If all have gone right, you are somewhere, this hot morning, moving Westward towards Paris, where you hoped to be on the <date when="1835-06-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of the month</date>. To London and home from that is but a cat&#x2019;s-leap! I hardly think you can be so good as your word in regard to the Paris date; however, there must in me be no delay: let this sheet lie ready to greet your arrival, be it soon be it late; to tell you that we sit here counting <pb id="pg-08-145" n="08:145"/>the days that still divide you from us; hoping in the goodness of Providence that we shall all meet once again,&#x2014;in thankfulness, in love and faith in the land of the living. It seems but as last week since that morning when I rode over the Bonshaw Flow<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220112-TC-JCE-01"><sic>2:3</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1822-01-22">22 Jan. 1822</date></corr></ref>. A marshy area in NE Annan; John&#x2019;s last visit was in summer, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>.</note> with you; and yet we have beaten many a foreign pavement since then; and in all senses some thing has altered in us and about us; only towards one another, I think, <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, nothing that is not for the better.&#x2014;&#x2014; Your Mantua-Bolzen Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bozen or Bolzano, at this time part of Austria, was on the road between Mantua and Innsbruck, 35 miles SSW of the Brenner Pass. John, in his letter which has not been found, or Carlyle must have confused the German and Italian forms to produce &#x201C;Bolzen.&#x201D; In his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> Carlyle notes: &#x201C;Letter from my Brother (some days ago: and &#xa3;140 at Bankers): to be in Paris if all go well about the <date when="1835-06-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of this month</date>! Had found my message lying for him at Bologna: his to me is dated at various points along the summit of the Alps.&#x201D;</note> arrived just ten days ago; the very morning after I had given Mill a packet to get franked for our Mother: I hastened over to the City; hoping that Mill had not been too expeditious; also in answer to Stone &#x26; Martin<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Bankers, Stone, Martin &#x26; Stone, 68 Lombard St.</note> who the same day had summonned me &#x201C;at my early convenience&#x201D; (the money-order having lain with them since the <date when="1835-03-26">26<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March</date>): all turned out right; Stone tabled me &#xa3;140 (in two Bank notes, which I keep here for you); Mill&#x2019;s frank lay unsent on his table, so I ripped it up again, introduced your Alpine news, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> despatched it,&#x2014;enjoying beforehand the enjoyment they would all get from it. Scarcely could your Bologna Letter<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><ref target="volume-08/lt-18350430-TC-JAC-01">Carlyle&#x2019;s letter to John of <date when="1835-04-30">30 April</date></ref>.</note> prove welcomer to you; tho&#x2019; that too was very strange (were one not used to Post-Offices); cheerfuller than a <hi rend="italic">well</hi> in the desert, for it was a winged <hi rend="italic">word</hi> chained down for you there, not to fly off (into your heart) till you got to it. We have, as you say, been very lucky with our Correspondence: not one Letter lost. And now if we had poor Doil himself back; and his <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pilgerstab</hi></foreign> [Pilgrim staff] laid safe up in the corner here.&#x2014; We have found an &#x201C;admirable Portrait&#x201D; of you lately, and are both agreed that it is like: the Head of Hogarth! I declare there is a resemblance: the same solidity and honesty; the same <hi rend="italic">greatness of feature</hi>, broad insight, and heartfelt love of fun; lying on earnestness tragical enough.&#x2014;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle was probably referring to Hogarth&#x2019;s self-portrait of his head and shoulders with his pug, Trump. He painted it in <date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>, and made a reversed engraving of it with some additions, in <date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>. Carlyle and Jane could have seen a reproduction of it as the frontispiece of John Trusler, <hi rend="italic">Works of William Hogarth</hi> (London, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>).</note> But I must not trifle.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-146" n="08:146"/>Not above a fortnight ago, I received a Letter from Alick; reporting that all was well in Scotland; our Mother&#x2019;s health as good as usual; the whole Brotherhood struggling along in their old fashion. Alick dated from Howes near Annan, his new place of abode: he had quitted Catlinns some few pounds poorer (farm stock had sold so low); saw as yet no very definite activity before him at Annan; spoke of doing a little in cattle over summer, a trade which I do not like for him, but knew not how to dissuade him from, idleness seeming still painfuller and worse. The Farm of Langdike was advertised (for next year) in last <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Longdike Farm, of 130 acres, Hoddam parish, half a mile north of Ecclefechan, advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1835-06-10">10 June</date>, was owned by Robert Carlyle of Waterbeck.</note> I put a mark at it; but whether it will have any suitableness I do not know. We shall see soon, let us hope, with more distinctness what he is doing, what is possible for him. America is a sore business; but for a man with children, with nothing but his <foreign><hi rend="italic">Thatkraft</hi></foreign> [energy] in husbandry to rely on, I know not but it were better at once. Our poor England, our poor Europe, has dark days in store for it. James Aitken and Jean had removed to our Uncle&#x2019;s late house in Academy Street, which they had purchased;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan.</date></ref></note> they seem to give satisfaction and good hope to all that observe their way of procedure. Mary and her husband had also shifted (to somewhere about George Square);<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George St.: there was no George Sq. in Annan.</note> and were going on very <foreign><hi rend="italic">cannily:</hi></foreign> James of Scotsbrig, according to Alick, was somewhat &#x201C;great in the pride of his eagle eye.&#x201D;&#x2014; I had also, shortly before, a Letter from Grahame;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham of Burnswark. Not found.</note> full of affectionate flowing sentiment; but with little intelligence: things, I doubt, were not going well with him; but he is warm, sympathetic, hopes and endures: &#x201C;<foreign>Ye maun dree</foreign> [bear] and <foreign>maun daur</foreign> [stand in awe]&#x201D;; it is the hest of man.</p>
<p>In our London circle, I have several things to tell you; but nothing so questionable as this, that my poor ill-starred <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> is lying as a mass of <hi rend="italic">un</hi>formed rubbish, fairly laid by under lock and key! About a fortnight after writing to you last, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was the deliberate-desperate resolution I came to. My way was daily getting more intolerable more inconsiderable; comparable (as I say often) to a man<hi rend="italic">swimming</hi> <foreign>in vacuo</foreign>; fluttering <hi rend="italic">his</hi> pennons vain:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 933.</note> there was labour nigh insufferable, but no joy, no furtherance: my poor nerves, for long months kept at the stretch, felt all too waste, distracted: I flung it by; <pb id="pg-08-147" n="08:147"/>saying, If I <hi rend="italic">never</hi> write it, why it will never be written; not by Ink alone shall a man live or die. This is the first time in my life I ever did such a thing: neither do I doubt much but it was rather wise. It goes abreast with much that is coming to a crisis with me. You would feel astonished to see with what quietude I have laid down my head on its stone pillow in these circumstances, and said to Poverty, Dispiritment, Exclusion, Necessity and the Devil: Go <hi rend="italic">your</hi> course, friends; behold, I lie here and rest! In fact, with all the despair that is round about me, there is not in myself I do think the least desperation: I feel rather, as if quite possibly I might be about <hi rend="italic">bursting</hi> the accursed enchantment that has held me all my weary days in <hi rend="italic">nameless</hi> thraldom; and actually beginning to be alive! There has been much given me to suffer, last year; to learn from. That things <hi rend="italic">should</hi> come to a crisis is what I wish; also how true is it, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deux afflictions mises ensemble peuvent devenir une consolation</hi></foreign> [Two afflictions put together can become a consolation]! On the whole, I shall never regret coming to London; where if boundless confusion, some elements of order have also met me: above all things, the real faces and lives of my fellow mortals, stupid or wise so unspeakably instructive to one. &#x201C;There <hi rend="italic">in others</hi> look discover / What thy own life&#x2019;s course hath been&#x201D;: this comes very often in my head of late.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Explained by the entry in Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;Very often of late has this stanza of Goethes come into my mind; I translated it in the <hi rend="italic">Wanderjahre</hi>, but never understood it before:<lb/><lb/>
<lg><l>&#x2018;There in others looks discover</l><lb/>
<l>What thy own life&#x2019;s hath been;</l><lb/>
<l>And thy deeds of years past over</l><lb/>
<l>In thy fellow man be seen.&#x2019;</l></lg><lb/><lb/>
It is verily so! I am (painfully) learning much here. If not by the wisdom of the people, yet by their existence, nay by their stupidity. Learn; live and learn!&#x201D; For Goethe&#x2019;s complete poem, translated by Carlyle, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 329&#x2013;30.</note>&#x2014; But you shall hear all and see all (if God please) ere long. Fancy me for the present reading all manner of silly Books, and for these late days one pregnant Book: Dante&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Inferno;</hi>&#x2014;running about among people and things; looking even, of a bright sunset, at Hyde Park and its glory: I sitting on the stump of an oak, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> rolling and curvetting past me (on the &#x201C;Serpentine&#x201D; drive), really very superb, and given <foreign><hi rend="italic">gratis</hi></foreign>.

<salute>My Dear Friend,</salute>
<p>Your very kind Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1835-04-30">30 April</date>.</note> has been in my hand, these four weeks; the subject of much meditation, which has not yet cleared itself into anything like a definite practical issue. Indeed, the conditions of the case are still not wholly before me: for if the American side of it, thanks to your perspicuous minuteness, is now tolerably plain, the European side continues dubious, too dim for a decision. So much in my own position here is vague, not to be measured; then there is a Brother, coming home to me from Italy, almost daily expected now; whose ulterior resolutions cannot but be influential on mine; for we are Brothers in the old good sense, and have one heart and one interest and object, and even one purse; and Jack is a <hi rend="italic">good man</hi>, for whom I daily thank Heaven, as for one of its principal mercies. He is Travelling Physician to the Countess of Clare; well entreated by her and hers; but I think, weary of that inane element of &#x201C;the English Abroad,&#x201D; and as good as determined to have done with it; to seek <hi rend="italic">work</hi> (he sees not well how), if possible, <hi rend="italic">with</hi> wages; but even almost <hi rend="italic">without</hi>, or with the lowest endurable, if need be. Work <hi rend="italic">and</hi> wages: the two prime necessities of man! It is pity they should ever be disjoined; <pb id="pg-08-156" n="08:156"/>yet of the two if one <hi rend="italic">must</hi>, in this mad Earth, be dispensed with, it is really wise to say at all hazards, Be it the wages then. This Brother (if the Heavens have been kind to me) must be in Paris one of these days; then here speedily; and &#x201C;the House must resolve itself into a Committee&#x201D;&#x2014;of ways and means.&#x2014; Add to all this that I myself have been and am one of the stupidest living men; in one of my vacant interlunar<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Samson Agonistes</hi>, 1.89.</note> conditions; unfit for deciding on anything: were I to give you my actual <hi rend="italic">view</hi> of this case, it were a view such as Satan had from the pavilion of the Anarch old. Alas, it is all too like Chaos: confusion of dense and rare: I also know what it is to drop <hi rend="italic">plumb</hi>, fluttering my pennons vain,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 933&#x2013;88.</note>&#x2014;for a series of weeks!</p>
<p>One point only is clear: that you, my Friend, are very friendly to me; that New England is as much my country and home as Old England. Very singular and very pleasant it is to me to feel as if I had a <hi rend="italic">house of my own</hi> in that far country: so many leagues and geographical degrees of wild-weltering &#x201C;unfruitful brine&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350611-TC-HB-01">TC to HB, [<date when="1835-06-11">11 June</date>]</ref>.</note> and then the hospitable hearth and the smiles of brethren awaiting one there! What with railways, steamships, printing-presses, it has surely become a most <hi rend="italic">monstrous</hi> &#x201C;tissue&#x201D; this life of ours; if evil and confusion on the one Hemisphere, then good and order in the other, a man knows not how: and so it rustles forth, immeasurable, from &#x201C;that roaring Loom of Time,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, I, i, 156. See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 55, for Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of the passage.</note>&#x2014;miraculous ever as of old!&#x2014; To Ralph Waldo Emerson, however, and those that love me as he, be thanks always; and a sure place in the sanctuary of the mind. Long shall we remember that Autumn Sunday<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1833-08-25">25 Aug. 1833</date>.</note> that landed him (out of Infinite Space) on the Craigenputtoch wilderness, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to leave us as he found us. My Wife says, whatever I decide on, I cannot thank you too heartily;&#x2014;which really is very sound doctrine. I write to tell you so much; and that you shall hear from me again when there is more to tell.</p>
<p>It does seem next to certain to me that I could preach a very considerable quantity of things from that Boston Pulpit, such as it is,&#x2014;were I once fairly started. If so, what an unspeakable relief were it too! Of the whole mountain of miseries one grumbles at in this life, the central and parent one, as I often say, is that you cannot utter yourself. The poor soul sits struggling, impatient, longing vehemently <pb id="pg-08-157" n="08:157"/>out towards all corners of the Universe, and cannot get its hest delivered, not even so far as the voice might do it. Imprisoned, enchanted, like the Arabian Price with half his body marble:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Young King of the Black Isles&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights Entertainments</hi>, trans. Jonathan Scott, (London, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>) I, 120 ff.</note> it is really bad work. Then comes bodily sickness; to act and react, and double the imbroglio<supplied>[.]</supplied> Till at last, I suppose; one does rise, like Eliphaz the Temanite; states that his inner man is bursting (as if filled with carbonic acid and new wine); that by the favour of Heaven he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> speak a word or two.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 4:1&#x2013;2.</note> Would it were come so far,&#x2014;if it be ever to come!</p>
<p>On the whole I think the odds are that I shall some time or other get over to you; but that for this winter I ought not to go. My London expedition is not decided hitherto; I have begun various relations and arrangements, which it were questionable to cut short so soon. That beggarly Book, were there nothing else, hampers me every way. To fling it once for all into the fire were perhaps the best; yet I grudge to do that. To finish it, on the other hand, is denied me for the present, or even so much as to work at it. What am I to do? When my Brother arrives, we go all back to Scotland for some weeks: there, in seclusion, with such calmness as I can find or create, the plan for the winter must be settled. You shall hear from me then; let us hope, something more reasonable than I can write at present. For about a month, I have gone to and fro utterly <hi rend="italic">idle:</hi> understand that, and I need explain no more. The wearied machine refused to be urged any farther; after long spasmodic struggling comes collapse. The burning of that wretched Manuscript has really been a sore business for me. Nevertheless that too shall clear itself, and prove a <hi rend="italic">favour</hi> of the Upper Powers: <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> to fresh fields and pastures new!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. last line of &#x201C;Lycidas.&#x201D;</note> This monstrous London has taught me several things during the past year; for if its Wisdom be of the most <hi rend="italic">un</hi>instructive ever heard of by that name of wisdom, its Folly abounds with lessons,&#x2014;which one ought to learn. I feel (with my burnt manuscript) as if defeated in this campaign; defeated, yet not altogether disgraced. As the great Fritz said, when the battle had gone against him: &#x201C;Another time we will do better.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230218-TC-JJ-01"><sic>2:288</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1823-02-18">18 Feb. 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>As to Literature, Politics, and the whole multiplex aspect of existence here, expect me not to say one word. We are a singular people, in a singular condition. Not many nights ago, in one of those phenomenal <pb id="pg-08-158" n="08:158"/>assemblages named routs, whither we had gone to see the countenance of O&#x2019;Connel<supplied>[l]</supplied> and Company (the Tail was a Peacock&#x2019;s tail, with blonde-muslin women and heroic Parliamentary men), one of the company, a &#x201C;distinguished female&#x201D; (as we call them) informed my Wife that &#x201C;O&#x2019;Connel was the master-spirit of this age.&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June</date></ref>. O&#x2019;Connell&#x2019;s &#x201C;Tail&#x201D; or following at the rout was of the radicals allied with him in Parliament at this time and their wives.</note> If so, then for what we have received let us be thankful,&#x2014;and enjoy it <hi rend="italic">without</hi> criticism.&#x2014; It often painfully seems to me as if much were coming fast to a crisis here; as if the crown-wheel had given way, and the whole horologe were rushing rapidly down, down, to its end! Wreckage is swift; rebuilding is slow and distant. Happily another than we has charge of it.</p>
<p>My new American Friends have come, and gone. Barnard went off northward some <supplied>[fort]</supplied>night ago; furnished with such guidance and furtherance as I could give him. Professor Longfellow went about the same time; to Sweden, then to Berlin and Germany: we saw him twice or thrice and his ladies, with great pleasure; as one sees worthy souls from a far country, who cannot abide with you, who throw you a kind greeting as they pass.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>), American poet. He had been professor of modern languages and librarian at Bowdoin College, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>. He was spending a year travelling in Europe to prepare for the chair of languages at Harvard which he held <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>. Emerson had sent him with a letter of introduction to Carlyle. See also Slater, p. 136. His &#x201C;ladies&#x201D; were his first wife, Mary Storer Potter (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>), and her friends, Clara Crowninshield (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1907-00-00">1907</date>), and Mary Caroline Goddard.</note> I inquired considerably about Concord and a certain man there; one of the fair pilgrims told me several comfortable things.&#x2014; By the bye, how very good you are, in regard to this of Unitarianism! I declare I am ashamed of my intolerance:&#x2014;and yet you have ceased to be a Teacher of theirs, have you not?

You will further allow me to fancy that you are now wedded; and offer our united congratulations and kindest good wishes to that new fair Friend of ours, whom one day we shall surely know more of,&#x2014;if the Fates smile.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson and Lydia Jackson were married on <date when="1835-09-14">14 Sept.</date></note></p>
<p>My sheet is ending, and I must not burden you with double <pb id="pg-08-159" n="08:159"/>postage, for such stuff as this. By dint of some inquiry I have learnt the law of the American Letter-carrying; and I now mention it for our mutual benefit. There are from New York to London three packets monthly (on the 1st, on the 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, on the 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi>); the masters of these carry Letters <foreign>gratis</foreign> for all men; and put the same into the Post-Office; there are some pence charged on the score of &#x201C;ship-letter&#x201D; there; and after that, the regular postage of the Country, if the Letter has to go farther. I put this, for example, into a place called North &#x26; South American Coffeehouse in the City here, and pay two-pence for it, and it flies.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350811-TC-HGR-01">TC to <sic>HG</sic><corr>HGR</corr>, [<date when="1835-08-11">11</date> or <date when="1835-08-18">18 Aug.</date></ref> ].</note> Doubtless there is some similar receiving-house with its &#x201C;leather bag&#x201D; somewhere in New York, and fixed days (probably the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> as our days) for emptying, or rather for typing and despatching said leather bag: if you deal with the London Packets (so long as I am here) in preference to the Liverpool ones, it will all be well. As for the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> Letter (if you write as I hope you may before hearing from me again), pray direct it &#x201C;Care of John Mill Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, India House, London&#x201D;; and he will forward it directly, should I even be still absent in the North.&#x2014; Now will you write; and pray write something about <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>.

<p>What an infidel you are to dream of my ever forgetting either your existence or your kindness<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She met Jane in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, but appears to have met Carlyle at Craigcrook about <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>. According to John Campbell Smith, <hi rend="italic">Writings by the Way</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1885-00-00">1885</date>), p. 485&#x2013;86, she &#x201C;used to tell,&#x201D; that he already &#x201C;talked the disrupted, amorphous, emphatic style of the &#x2018;Latter-Day Pamphlets.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-160" n="08:160"/>Woman tho I be; and tho Mr John Jeffrey once said of me [not in my hearing]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane&#x2019;s brackets.</note> that I was &#x201C;distinguished as a flirt&#x201D; in my time; I can tell you; few people are as steady in their attachments. that I was <hi rend="italic">attached</hi> to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a person of your quick penetration could hardly fail to observe.</p>
<p>You were very kind to me, and that was not all: you were several things that women rarely are&#x2014;straight-forward and clear-sighted among the rest<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Campbell Smith, pp. 488&#x2013;89, says that her most striking feature was &#x201C;a great strength of common sense, rather hard and masculine in all its character. &#x2026; She was logical rather than poetical. &#x2026; The most prominent feature of her moral nature was a strong practical benevolence. &#x2026; Altogether, a &#x2026; kindly, friendly, true-hearted, clear-headed, noble sort of woman.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;and so I liked you and have continued to like you to this hour.

<p>Susan Hunter of St. Andrews, now and long since Mrs. Stirling of Edinburgh, was daughter of a Professor Hunter in St. Andrews University, and granddaughter of a famous do. do.,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hunter (<date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>) born in Closeburn, Dumfriesshire, professor of humanities, <date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, and principal, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>, United College, St. Andrews.</note> whose editions of Virgil and various other Latin classics, all excellently printed in the little county town of Cupar, Fife, are held in deserved esteem, not among ourselves only, but in Germany itself, by the best judges there.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He edited a series of &#x201C;immaculate&#x201D; classics (editions of Sallust, Horace, Caesar, Livy, Virgil, etc.) <date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, published by James Morison, Perth, and William Tullis, Cupar, university printers to St. Andrews.</note></p>
<p>To an elder sister of this Susan the afterwards famous Francis Jeffrey, then a young Edinburgh advocate, had been wedded, and was greatly attached; but she soon died from him and left him a childless <pb id="pg-08-161" n="08:161"/>widower.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle was mistaken: Francis Jeffrey&#x2019;s first wife was Catherine Wilson (d. <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>) daughter of Charles Wilson (d. <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>), professor of divinity, St. Andrews, <date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>, and sister of Susan Hunter&#x2019;s mother, Jane Wilson.</note> A second sister of Susan&#x2019;s, I believe, had married John Jeffrey, younger and only brother of Francis; but she too had died, and there were no children left.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her elder sister, Elizabeth Helen (b. <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>) was married by this time to John Jeffrey, as his second wife. His first wife, Susan, of Boston, Mass., had died in <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>.</note> John Jeffrey followed no profession, had wandered about the world, at one time been in America, in revolutionary France, but had since settled pleasantly in Edinburgh within reach of his brother, and was a very gentle, affectionate, pleasantly social and idly ingenious man. I remember Susan and her one younger sister as living often with John Jeffrey;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In all Susan Hunter had three younger sisters.</note> I conclude it was at Craigcrook, at Francis Jeffrey&#x2019;s, that we had made acquaintance with her. She was a tall, lean, cleanly-trim and wise-looking, though by no means beautiful woman, except that her face and manners expressed nothing that was not truthful, simple, rational, modest though decided. Susan and a brother of hers, John,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hunter (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>), eldest son and third child.

He is said to have first met Carlyle about <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>. In <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date> he married Helen Vary; there were seven children. He was a shrewd Edinburgh lawyer and businessman and also a sound scholar. For his friendship with Hunt and meetings with Carlyle see later vols., and Walter C.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>The accompanying Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found, but Carlyle writes in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;I had resolved to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> idle till my Brother came home, and we had spoken together and seen Scotland; so sat waiting his Letter,&#x2014;reading Novels and Trash. One morning a fortnight ago the Letter came.&#x201D; He records his disappointment that they were not to meet, and that he had written to him with advice. &#x201C;Wrote the sad news to my Mother&#x201D; (<date when="1835-07-15">15 July</date>).</note> from our dear Doctor will give you, as it has given us, not a little disappointment. Just when we made sure <pb id="pg-08-162" n="08:162"/>of his return, and were expecting daily to hear word at what hour it should be, comes this announcement that at soonest it cannot be for two months yet! Lady Clare has fallen sick, or perhaps only fallen weary and disheartened; so our poor Jack dates not from Paris, whither my Letter had gone to wait him, but from Munich, with notice to address him next at Geneva, which is <hi rend="italic">aside</hi> from the road homewards. We are very much grieved; and all our schemes are tumbled heels over head, for the present. I had been sitting quite idle ever since I wrote to you the time before last; with the determination that I would work no more till we had all met again; and very impatient was I to see that day arrive: but now, as is often the case, &#x201C;between the cup and the lip&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> a thing has intervened! However, we must shape a new course, and adjust ourselves once more to that.</p>
<p>My first reflexion was a petulant one, on the power of the rich over the poor, how the whim of one rich individual can turn to confusion the schemes of so many poor ones, and set us all a-sorrowing, simply by the power of money: but I checked that as unjust; I felt how much cause there was still for joy seeing we were all in life and health; nay my pity for ourselves gave place to pity for the poor Lady who seems the cause of it all. Perhaps she is not to be blamed in any way but rather to be sympathized with. Our own private conjecture is that she has been turned back from England by a reason of which Jack may be still ignorant. Her Husband, it appears, is just come home from India;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Fitzgibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare, separated from Lady Clare since <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>, was returning home from being Governor of Bombay, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>. See also <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310818-TC-AC-01"><sic>5:343</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1831-08-18">18 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> nor is it unlikely the news of that may have met her by the road, and staggered all her resolutions. If so, our conjecture is farther that she will not come home this summer at all; but spend the pleasant weather in Switzerland, and turn back to Italy before winter; so that unless Jack give up his engagement with her (or rather do not form a new one, for the old expires in <date when="1835-09-00">September</date>) all his expectations and ours of a meeting are postponed for a year.</p>
<p>He asks very seriously as you will see, and very wisely in his way of doing it, what advice I have for him in regard to this renewal of his engagement. I intend writing to him tomorrow, and distinctly counselling him to insist either on &#xa3;500 for another year, or liberty to practice with his old salary, or else a direct return home. Money, <pb id="pg-08-163" n="08:163"/>Heaven knows, is not without use to us; but time and the best years of one&#x2019;s life are also useful. I see very well the poor Doctor is in sad want of employment in that dead City; that his mind is in no cheerful or altogether wholesome condition; that he ought to make and indeed ere long must make some resolute start for fixed employment somewhere; finally that with his faculty and character there cannot ultimately be a risk of finding honest bread somewhere on this Earth&#x2019;s surface, where sickness always is, and the power to cure sickness always remains valuable.&#x2014; So we shall see how it goes; but nothing can be decided yet for a month or two.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Replacing &#x201C;week&#x201D; which is crossed out.</note> My guess rather is that the Lady will <hi rend="italic">give</hi> him the &#xa3;500, and engage him for another year: in which case, alas, there is greatly less chance of our seeing him for this season. But what can we do, my dear Mother? what but <hi rend="italic">wait</hi>&#x2014;on the guidance of One who knows better than we! Let us never despond, or be downcast: I know, dear Mother, you will pluck up your heart again, and taking the best view of everything, again begin cheerfully expecting. Five hundred more pounds will prove of great service to Jack when his liberty comes; and we shall all be the gladder to meet when that glad hour does arrive. In this way, at any rate, we must leave the business, so far as he is concerned; and wait patiently what Time and Providence will bring.</p>
<p>As for our own share of it, there is need of a new resolution, and we have gone far to form one. Jane thinks that if we are to wait till <date when="1835-09-00">September</date>, it will be needless for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to come to Scotland this year: she had in the main only her Mother to see there; and it seems the shorter way to send for her Mother up hither, without delay (if she will come, as at some time or other she purposed to do): Jack and I (if he is coming) can go to Scotland by ourselves; at lowest, when Mrs Welsh was returning, I would accompany her, and you would see me at least.&#x2014; The most <hi rend="italic">important</hi> part of the resolution is that I, at any rate, am to fall instantly <hi rend="italic">to work again;</hi> having now filled up my full measure of idleness. This is the way it stands.</p>
<p>So you see, dear Mother, how our bits of plans are all turned topsy turvy (as Burns&#x2019;s Mouse might be, when the ploughshare went thro&#x2019; its nest);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Burns&#x2019;s &#x201C;To a Mouse, On turning her up in her Nest, with the Plough, <date when="1785-11-00">November 1785</date>.&#x201D;</note> and we have all to make what industry may be possible to form new ones. I think I am sorriest for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> of the whole of us. I see the sad look of resignation you put on, and how all your expectations for these bright summer days are so sorrowfully overclouded. <pb id="pg-08-164" n="08:164"/>Nevertheless I know you will soon <hi rend="italic">rally,</hi> and not let it beat you; you will think <date when="1835-08-00">August</date> is coming, and with the yellow crops, your two Boys. Nay, I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> then perhaps have my Book done, and shall come home with twice as light a heart. <hi rend="italic">Doubtless</hi> it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be better for us all.&#x2014; You will notice that I have given you above the very <hi rend="italic">sourest</hi> interpretation the thing seems capable of; in order that if you are to be disappointed again, it may rather be in the glad way. There is a clear probability of Jack&#x2019;s actually coming in <date when="1835-08-00">August</date>; two probabilities, both that the Lady and he may come, and also that he may come by himself. Let us see how it turns; let us pray and trust that it may turn for the best, whichever way that be.</p>
<p>I must now tell you a little how we go on here. As mentioned already, I have been altogether idle these five or six weeks; reading insignificant Books; talking to people; resting myself, till I saw what the days brought forth. If this have done nothing more for me, it has evidently made me a good deal stronger: I have recovered my colour and force; and mean now, as I said, to begin working again with new vigour. That wretched burnt Manuscript must, if the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">gea</hi></foreign> [vigour] of life&#x201D; remain in me, be replaced: you cannot fancy how the whole business has got inexpressibly ugly to me, how I long to be done with it, and have my hands free again. &#x201C;It shall be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, Sir,&#x201D; as the Cockneys say!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340526-JWC-TC-01"><sic>7:191</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1834-05-26">26 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> After that, the whole world is before me, where to choose.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, XII, 646.</note> I cannot say that I am, in the smallest degree, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">tining</hi></foreign> [losing] heart,&#x201D; in these perplexities: nay, I think in general, I have not been in as good heart, these ten years. London and its quackeries and follies and confusions does not daunt me; I look on all matters that pertain to it with a kind of silent defiance; confident to the last that the work my Maker meant me to do I shall verily do, let the Devil and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> servants obstruct as they will. Have I not reason to thank God for all my sorrows too? They have burnt away much impurity that was in me; some things too they have called into life and vigour for me. At worst, I always feel that <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is the place for me to make the struggle; distracted as the world is, it is still God&#x2019;s world, and here in the middle of it, not in solitude as at Puttoch, must I strike forth my capabilities, and work and do, while it is called Today.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 9:4.</note> O Mother, if I can retain the precepts that you and the good men who have gone before us walked by, why should I fear aught under the stars? A thousand thanks to you for what you taught me from my birth upwards! Mother&#x2019;s milk nursed <pb id="pg-08-165" n="08:165"/>my little bodily life; and a still more precious milk ministered to my spiritual one. Let it be a comfort to you to hear this deliberately, and with a son&#x2019;s gratitude, testified now when I too have grey hairs here and there and do know it.

<p>The Literary Craft, as I have often explained to you, seems gone for this generation: I do not see how a man that will not take the Devil into partnership (one of the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> partnerships, if I have any judgment) is to exist by it henceforth.

I do not get angry with it, impatient with it; I have computed the worst it can bring me, and also the best, and find there is at bottom a very small difference between these! It is on oneself and what comes of one&#x2019;s own doing that all depends.&#x2014; However, to be a little more particular I must have this Book <hi rend="italic">off my hands</hi> (should I even burn it, I will be done with it): this is the first thing I found on at present. Secondly, I have, as was hinted once before, some kind of outlook in regard to being employed about National Education; which is the work I ought perhaps to covet more than any other in the world.

<p>My Dear Brother,</p>
<p>The frank carries but indifferent news today; and may take this little scrap along with the rest, as proof at least that if I had good news I would willingly let you share in them. We are not to meet so soon as was expected; nay, as you will find by our Mother&#x2019;s Letter, there is even a possibility (which, however, we will disbelieve in, as long as possible) that poor Jack and we are not to meet this year at all. It is very mortifying; but as usual in such cases, we ought rather to feel thankful that it is not worse; that it is not loss of life or limb to any of us; but only a postponement (as we trust it will but be) of what we wished, whereby the fulfilment will be all the joyfuller to us.</p>
<p>I wish I had any good word that I could write for you here, my Boy, to encourage you in your new struggle, which I often picture to myself with interest and anxiety. There is little good going, I think, for many an industrious man, as times are. It is a sore struggle, and poor wages; with little outlook of its mending in our thank [to our advantage]. I said before, I did not like the craft you were driven into in these months; and yet I feel well, it is the only craft you have just now, and that idleness is the worst craft of all. Go on with it, then, my dear Brother, while you must, and hope and look diligently for something better. Go on with it <hi rend="italic">wisely:</hi> there is a wise way and a foolish way of doing all things in the world.&#x2014;&#x2014; I marked the Advertisement of <hi rend="italic">Longdike Farm</hi> in the Newspaper one week:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June</date></ref>.</note> but whether you might judge <hi rend="italic">that</hi> a speculation of any promise I could not conjecture. It is in the district of country you would like, and I believe a tolerable Farm; but too likely not to be had at a tolerable rent. Doubtless you would hear about it, and judge; and make trial too, if there seemed any feasibility.</p>
<p>To me, I confess, when looking at this country and the perverse state it is in, one of the best refuges, tho&#x2019; somewhat of a stern one to <pb id="pg-08-167" n="08:167"/>take, is the one you alluded to in your Letter: America, and &#x201C;over the water&#x201D; to&#x2014;food for one&#x2019;s toil! It is really a great blessing of Heaven that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> land under the sun, where the husbandman&#x2019;s hand will bring <hi rend="italic">him</hi> corn for his ploughing; a country which God&#x2019;s sky stretches over, even as here, and where man&#x2019;s perversion has not stept in to say, &#x201C;Thou that tillest, let <hi rend="italic">another</hi> reap!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gal. 6:7.</note> You remember, in old years I used always to dissuade from America; neither am I yet any adviser of it, where extremity has not arrived: but the longer I look and live the less questionable does it seem,&#x2014;I might say, the more inevitable for thousands and millions of European men. But in the mean time, you must play &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">hoolly</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [slowly, gently]; be <foreign><hi rend="italic">canny</hi></foreign> and patient till you see well what Annan will do for you. There must be many kinds of business going on there, at one season of the year or another; and strange will it be if you are the unfittest of all for all of them! Keep clear-headed clear-hearted; be as <hi rend="italic">cheerful</hi> as is possible for you; meeting all men with the look of peace tolerance and even trust: whatsoever is to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> seen will shew itself, and you will clutch at it deftly enough if it look suitable. And so God speed you, my dear Alick! Take a pen and write to me what you are about: the mere telling of it over to me will make it plainer to yourself.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We must not let this disappointment provoke us, or sit too heavy on us; yet surely it is hard enough to bear. All things had been so fitted and adjusted to meet your home-coming (which, however, I never dared to look upon as infallible); I was waiting daily with increased impatience to learn your safe arrival in Paris; when Jane brought in the Letter, I clutched as it as you may fancy, yet with a certain misgiving when I noticed that the postmark was not French; and then&#x2014;what an instantaneous overturn, extending too thro&#x2019; Annandale and Nithsdale, and making so many hearts sad! We cannot help it, Boy; we must submit to it, and try to make a new arrangement out of it. One&#x2019;s first thought was a kind of anger in the midst of sorrow; but that, as one looks at it, gives place to sympathy, to real pity. Did you happen to understand that Lord Clare had arrived here home from Bombay? Our theory is that news of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> had met your Lady on the road, and given her pause. In which case, what is our sorrow to hers which causes ours! Life&#x2019;s fairest fruit become a poison; one of the lofty of the world thrust down (by unknown fatality) lower than the low; doomed to <hi rend="italic">banishment</hi>, as inexorable, far painfuller than that of Botany Bay! Let us <hi rend="italic">pity</hi> the heart that suffers, whether it beat under <pb id="pg-08-169" n="08:169"/>silk or under sackcloth.&#x2014; However, the practical inference, if this theory is just, seems now to be that Lady Clare will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come to England this year; that she will spend the summer at Geneva, and then for winter turn southwards again. You, close at hand, and with this Bombay fact now before you, will be able to judge accurately. It reduces our problem to a much simpler shape: knowing what others will do, you have now to decide what you will do. I approve much, dear Jack, of the <hi rend="italic">way</hi> in which you ask advice from me; to assist you on resolving for yourself. What is clear to me I will now say. In the first place, then, I am quite decided for your <hi rend="italic">not</hi> going back to Rome on the old terms: if &#xa3;500 will tempt you to go back with any cheerfulness, demand at once to have that sum; or else liberty to practice with your old salary. Of these two I think her Ladyship would at once prefer the former: &#xa3;500 and another year of exile, these are the things you have to balance against each other. And <hi rend="italic">here</hi> I confess myself to be quite at a loss. There is no doubt but another &#xa3;500 would be extremely valuable; yet there are other things valuable too; neither is money, except as a mean not an end, the thing you want. I myself, who stand at this hour rubbing shoulders, as it were, with the gaunt skeleton Poverty, in all its ugliness, feel well that money, except as it might get the tools for <hi rend="italic">working</hi>, would in no wise remedy my sufferings; that if a beneficent genius were this day to settle an independency on me, it were in itself as mere nothing. Now is not this, and perhaps more emphatically<supplied>[,]</supplied> just your feeling? I see your kind brotherly purpose, my poor Boy, in inviting me to Rome: you think the additional &#xa3;200 would support me there; that I should be rested, improved; that we should be company to one another, and the certainty of all this would make another Roman season tolerable. It is very kind, my dear Jack, but on practical survey of the matter, one feels in a moment that it will not do. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, so long as I can hold out, is the place for me; I must learn <hi rend="italic">here</hi> to live; or renounce the hope of ever doing it in these climates or under any known conditions. I could not rest in Rome: alas, what I want and have always wanted is not rest but work. Therefore this part of the &#xa3;500 scheme falls away; remains only as a blessed remembrance to me that I have a Brother with brotherlike heart. And now can you go for the money by itself? Or even if the liberty of practice were conceded you, what outlook is there of your finding practice? This you only can judge. It seems to me, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you had a prospect of realizing something like &#xa3;500 <hi rend="italic">with</hi> practice; I mean, part of it <hi rend="italic">by</hi> practice, you ought to be strongly tempted to go: yet here too I am all in twilight, and could sanction <pb id="pg-08-170" n="08:170"/>any decision you might come to. For I discern very well both that Rome with nothing to do there is a most unsatisfying arrangement for you, and also a <hi rend="italic">losing</hi> as well as sorrowful one. You <hi rend="italic">lose</hi> another of your best years: your time goes; and what is even more, your spirit and fund of hope. There is not wholesomeness in that Cathedral-mood<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a reference to something John had said in his last letter, which has not been found.</note> which is so natural to you there: I cannot disapprove of it (<hi rend="italic">far</hi> from that), for it is your nearest possible approach to what is best and manliest; but I do regret the circumstances that render it inevitable. There is a considerable weight in this item. It is strange how unfit one grows (towards forty) for forming new friendships, new relations; almost incapable of it. Your meditative devout temper will increase in an inactive Roman life; but that is not the thing in need of increase with you.&#x2014; On the other hand, what can I offer you in London? Let me be as candid as possible; neither aggravating nor extenuating. There is first, what you well know, the supreme dominion of quackery and triviality, in your profession as in all, perhaps even more in yours than in several. Ask and consider as I may, I can yet see no daylight thro&#x2019; the enemies to medical success here. Very sagacious people tell you it is all <hi rend="italic">chance</hi>. Yet men do live by medicine: I see a scrubby commonplace individual dashing about these very streets with gig and red collared boy; apparently full of business. Willis<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Dr. Willis, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341224-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:357</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-12-24">24 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> tells me he was evidently getting into work; simply by announcing himself on his door-plate, telling his butcher, baker &#x26;c that he was <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> to give aid <foreign>gratis</foreign> to any poor person that needed it. Willis is but a trivial limited man, yet he is no quack: I find he still makes a handsome <foreign>peculium</foreign> annually by some kind of <hi rend="italic">subterranean</hi> medical Literature; I mean redacting of Treatises, for ambitious monied Doctors, translating &#x26;c &#x26;c: all (what Glen<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Glen.</note> would call) <foreign><hi rend="italic">sotto-voce</hi></foreign> [quietly], he himself not discerned in the business. In short employment does exist; and one infers and firmly believes that the brave man with patient open heart (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Geradheit, Urtheil und Vertr&#xE4;glichkeit</hi></foreign> [uprightness, judgment, and sociability]) must and will find it, and even be <hi rend="italic">kept alive</hi> in return for doing it. Now in the midst of this mad quack-vortex, let me tell you also there is not wanting a certain most feeble yet genuine element of worth; better perhaps after all than is going elsewhere. We here, in our obstruction, could bring you into a small circle, where you would ere long feel yourself really <pb id="pg-08-171" n="08:171"/><foreign><hi rend="italic">heimlich:</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Secret; but perhaps in error for &#x201C;<foreign>heimisch</foreign>&#x201D; [at home].</note> good people, of sense, of principle, of perfect courtesy, one or two of them rich people; but whether it would turn to <hi rend="italic">medical</hi> account any great way one might still ask. I think they would mostly like you; and I say, quite soberly, it is the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> &#x201C;society&#x201D; (in all senses of that word) we ever fell in with anywhere. Farther take this economical item with you: That living with the rigorous thrift which we exercise, yet which does not seem to affect our reception and equal acceptation in the smallest, you might clap your Doctor&#x2019;s Plate on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> door, and live with us, looking round you on all sides, a twelve-month for the sum of &#xa3;100. This is Jane&#x2019;s calculation too; and includes clothes for yourself, and <hi rend="italic">every</hi> item, calculated really on a <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;lucky&#x201D;</hi> scale. This is a very <hi rend="italic">good</hi> house; in a neighborhood of respectability, exactly two miles from Hyde Park Corner, and directly on one of the fashionable streams of West End Carriages; the King&#x2019;s Road (from Sloane Street, Belgrave &#x26; Eaton Squares &#x26;c) leading close by us. Nay we will <hi rend="italic">shift</hi>, Jane says, if you found that essential for a trial. Add only that our own resources at this time are just adequate for keeping us one other year in London; and that we are minded to see the <hi rend="italic">thing out</hi> in this place before trying another. You see therefore how it stands and fits on that side: our resources you, and that, by God&#x2019;s great goodness, we have all the heart to join them brotherly into union, and front the bad world <hi rend="italic">together</hi> not divided. I can advise you no farther, my dear Brother; except, what I trust is superfluous, to give way to no fear, nor other deranging influence, but decide freely, and in a way that will bear acting on. And so wishing you God&#x2019;s blessing to guide your judgement (for surely there is an unseen blessing and guidance, if one seek it well), we wait, with deep interest, what you will determine. It may be the next Letter will bring it; and may be it will not: do not hurry yourself, or shake the fruit till it is ripe.</p>
<p>As for our own plans they are all altered too by your Letter; and even in some degree re-made. Jane decided at once that waiting till Harvest for her journey (as her Mother is sitting in hourly expectancy) would answer ill, or worse than something else would: so, her mother being almost all she had to see in Scotland, a Letter is already under way calling on Mrs Welsh to set off and come <hi rend="italic">hither;</hi> Jane determining to stay where she is for this year. Mrs Welsh, I rather imagine, will come: then you and I can go to Scotland, at what season soever you are ready. I also wrote to our Mother yesterday, <pb id="pg-08-172" n="08:172"/>along with your Letter; smoothing the disappointment for her; preparing her even for the possibility of your not getting home this year at all. Poor Mother! I was sorriest for her of us all; but I know she will adjust herself too; and as I said, our meeting will be all the gladder when it does come.&#x2014; With regard to myself, you would see by the Paris Letter, how I sat in perfect sluggishness; putting all off till your arrival; a state which was daily growing more irksome to me. I have decided on falling instantly to work again, with vigour. If I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write that Revolution Volume (the saddest affair I ever had to manage), I will do it. The first wish of my heart is that it were <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, in almost any way: weary, most weary am I of it; I will either write it, or burn it, or&#x2014;. One thing that will gratify you much is the perceptible increase of health this otherwise so scandalous <foreign><hi rend="italic">Faullenzen</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sic:</hi> idling] has given me. I am also farther than ever from &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">tining</hi></foreign> [losing] heart.&#x201D; Nothing definite yet turns up for my future life; yet several things turn more decisively <hi rend="italic">down</hi> (which also is something); among others Literature: I feel well that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is a thing I shall never live by here; moreover that there are <hi rend="italic">many</hi> things besides <hi rend="italic">it</hi> in God&#x2019;s Universe. The National Education affair, as I probably told you, is <hi rend="italic">off</hi> for this season; but all believe, it will and must come on before long: neither am I without a real hope of getting something to do there. Of a kind that would please me much! Then, as a last resource, in the dim background, rises America, rise the kindest invitations thence: I really could go (were all else done), and open my mouth in Boston to that strange audience, with considerable audacity; perhaps it were the <hi rend="italic">making</hi> of me to learn to speak. Why then should one complain; with prospects, not without present work? I really in my sane moods feel no kind of tendency to whimper or even to gloom: God&#x2019;s world, &#x201C;ruled over&#x201D; by the Prince of the Power of the Air,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Satan. Cf. Eph. 2:2.</note> is round me; and I have taken my side in it, and know what I mean as well as the Prince knows. Fancy me as <hi rend="italic">working</hi>, and not unhappy, till I hear from you.&#x2014; I have read a considerable number of foolish Books, also somewhat of Dante which I like much, and find not so hard as might have been; I see people, all kinds of <hi rend="italic">sincere</hi> people are welcome to me: I was trimming up the garden, with hoe and shears (that it might be smart for your arrival!) when Jane brought me in (or rather <hi rend="italic">out</hi>) the Munich Letter. Last night we had a party! One of the smallest of parties: A Miss and Mr Wilson to meet John Mill. It went <pb id="pg-08-173" n="08:173"/>off <hi rend="italic">with effect</hi>, Jane says; as another (or two) of the kind we had has done. They are easy, cheap; cost one cup of tea, and the lighting of the sinumbra lamp. This Miss Wilson is perhaps our cleverest woman; nowise a &#x201C;distinguished female&#x201D;; but a really effectual woman; verging very gracefully towards old-maidhood: better considerably than Mrs Somerville, whom also we can do a little with. A certain Irish Mr Darley I spoke of has been back here, and confirms our good opinion of him: the elder Sterlings are running about us continually,&#x2014;without offence, or even with help and an honest courtesy. This is the course we go; from the outline you can construe it and complete it.&#x2014; There has been no direct word from Annandale since I wrote, only a letter from Mrs Welsh, and the weekly Newspaper-emblem that all is tolerably well. &#x201C;Richie Irving&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The obituary of Richard Irving, herring merchant of Annan, was in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1835-06-24">24 June</date>.</note> (do you remember him at Annan?) is deceased; also &#x201C;Bob Robinson,&#x201D; so long a fixture at &#x201C;the Buck.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The son of George and Helen Robinson, licensees of the Buck Inn, Annan.</note> Not a word of Glen or of his Brother; of Waugh, or of either of the Nelsons&#x2014;except that Grahame once mentioned Ben some two months ago, as well, and well affected towards us. I will send Arbuckle notice <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to wait for us, if he have not already ceased waiting.</p>
<p>We have not seen Miss Morris again, but meant to do it yesterday; and now I am to go by myself today, the instant I am <supplied>[at]</supplied> the bottom of this page: Jane has a kind of headache and dare not venture out in the heat but I am to try if I can make some arrangement for their meeting some day in the evening.&#x2014; The d&#x2019;Eichthal Letter came by the &#x201C;Threepenny&#x201D; that very hour your fuller Munich one came: it was inclosed in an autograph from the Youth himself, in tolerable English, announcing with regret &#x26;c that he was just setting off for Paris, but would be back in two months.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >None of these letters has been found.

<p>You will see Sterling&#x2019;s (projected) duel with Roebuck in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. A. Roebuck had begun publication on <date when="1835-06-11">11 June</date> of <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets for the People</hi>, issued weekly to evade prosecution as an unstamped newspaper. He then attacked the press in an exchange on stamp duty in the House of Commons, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June</date>, for showing &#x201C;the most paltry corruption, the basest cowardice, and the blackest immorality&#x201D; as their &#x201C;governing principles.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1835-06-21">21 June</date>, responded fairly temperately. But the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, from <date when="1835-06-19">19 June</date>, replied to him virulently and illogically as &#x201C;that rabid little reviler&#x201D; issuing &#x201C;pestilent trash,&#x201D; (<date when="1835-06-19">19 June</date>), which was &#x201C;insufferably dull,&#x201D; &#x201C;insolent&#x201D; and &#x201C;disgusting trash&#x201D; (<date when="1835-06-22">22 June</date>). Against this background the third <hi rend="italic">Pamphlet, The Stamped Press of London, and its Morality, &#x26;c</hi>, published about <date when="1835-06-25">25 June</date>, contained allegations against Fonblanque as editor of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, and Edward Sterling, whom he accused of &#x201C;&#x2018;cowardice,&#x2019; &#x2018;baseness,&#x2019; &#x2018;skulking&#x2019; in order to escape the punishment due to <supplied>[his]</supplied> acts; &#x2018;dishonesty&#x2019; &#x2018;selling <supplied>[himself]</supplied> to the Tory party&#x2019;; &#x2018;charlatanism in society, to hide <supplied>[his]</supplied> editorship of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>,&#x2019; and a degree of depravity worse than that of an &#x2018;assassin.&#x2019;&#x201D; On <date when="1835-06-27">27 June</date>, Fonblanque and Sterling demanded the withdrawal of Roebuck&#x2019;s accusations, Sterling adding &#x201C;I never have been technically or morally connected in any manner with the editorship of <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, not possessing over the course or choice of its politics any power or influence whatsoever, nor, by consequence, being responsible for its acts.&#x201D; Sir William Molesworth delivered Roebuck&#x2019;s letters of withdrawal, both dated <date when="1835-06-27">27 June</date>. Both correspondences were published in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1835-06-29">29 June</date>. In <date when="1835-11-00">November</date> Roebuck actually fought a duel with John Black, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, provoked by a later <hi rend="italic">Pamphlet</hi>.</note>&#x2014;I find I could get employment and, nay, writing <hi rend="italic">there</hi>; but I will have no trade with that. Old S. amuses me a little; has eyes, has had them on men and men&#x2019;s ways many years now: a trenchant, clean-washed military old gentleman, with a tendency to pot-belly. Roebuck seems to be becoming a kind of English Marat. He has not the stuff of Marat; is more like some poor acidulent cold-implacable Robespierre.</p>

<p>Why should I blot your page [preceding 4 paragraphs are written between the lines, with the sheet reversed] with such stuff as this? Let me end <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.&#x2014; I wrote to Alick by our Mother&#x2019;s frank; an encouraging word: I had heard nothing from him or of him since I wrote before. I spoke of <hi rend="italic">Longdike</hi> Farm (to let); but knew not whether there was any feasability in it.</p>
<p>Miss Morris was unfortunately not in yesterday: I left a card for her and a kind message. Jane and she must &#x201C;exchange threepennies;&#x201D; that is to say Miss M. must be invited hither for a day: she is a good girl tho&#x2019; <foreign>sch&#xfc;chtern</foreign> [shy].</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s dull headache continues; or she would have written better. I have a great disposition this morning (Friday, the date of all these margins) to say, Throw up that melancholic business, and come! But I dare not say it, and do not. Jane is already scheming out &#x201C;what rooms&#x201D; are to be yours, &#x26;c &#x26;c; and getting it all concocted and dished. The &#xa3;100 is even a <hi rend="italic">too</hi> liberal calculation; by <hi rend="italic">rigour</hi> of thrift &#xa3;50 might almost do. You have a <hi rend="italic">home</hi> always, while a Brother has one: understand this <hi rend="italic">without</hi> restriction. I fancy Lady Clare will offer you the &#xa3;500; <hi rend="italic">then</hi> will come the weighing! I suppose farther her Ladyship does not care one straw now or henceforth about your <hi rend="italic">interests?</hi> Yet if a man <hi rend="italic">can</hi> alleviate human pain, he is master of a godlike secret, which in all lands of the Earth will <hi rend="italic">make</hi> men care for him. Courage Boy!</p>
<p>It seems to me, the reign of Quackery is, in some departments, <hi rend="italic">past</hi> its height perhaps; and there has begun to be a reaction even here. Several persons are deeply sensible of the misery, and silently wishing (preparing, if they saw how) to resist it.&#x2014; How much money could you have in coming home just now? near &#xa3;500?&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>As the last Letter must have brought you little but unpleasant news, I had it in contemplation, of late days, to write to you again, that if my news were not of the best, they might be the more frequent; for I know well it makes you happier to hear from me when my news are not positively <hi rend="italic">bad</hi>. Luckily yesterday there came this Letter from our Doctor;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> which will make my sheet better worth its carriage. Jane is gone out to &#x201C;a music Party&#x201D; with the Sterlings (whom I think I mentioned to you; very kind people, who come out to us often of late): she will not be home till late; I have sent the woman to bed, and have the house to myself. I thought once of getting on a little with my Book-writing (on your old principle, which I always remember, &#x201C;that it will not <foreign><hi rend="italic">loup</hi></foreign> <hi rend="italic">in again</hi>&#x201D;);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310329-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:258</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1831-03-29">29 March 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> but a better thought suggests itself that I shall do more good writing for Scotsbrig than for the world at this late hour; the rather, as I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> my bit of task today, in some manner, and have little force in me to resume it. You shall have therefore what is going; till &#x201C;the Wife&#x201D; come home, and send me to sleep.&#x2014; I regret greatly that my Letters to you have not been so deliberate, radical and complete as they should have been: but you will fancy all manner of excuses for me; which indeed I am not without right to; such &#x201C;driving from post to pillar,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> and unsatisfactory hoping and being disappointed, working and being idle, have I had for a good while now. The Burning of that Manuscript has proved hitherto about the very ugliest job I ever had to deal with, in innocency: but I shall get thro&#x2019; it too, and without <hi rend="italic">doubt</hi> (if I be wise) <pb id="pg-08-178" n="08:178"/>it will prove for good, and not evil. I am at work again, as you will guess; and more at ease with myself.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle records in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;Finished day before yesterday that Third Chapter; which I had resumed some ten days ago. With immense difficulty; inconsiderable success! It is and continues the most ungrateful, intolerable of all tasks; but I must in with it, I must be thro&#x2019; it and have some peace of mind.&#x2014; My health a little improved. Projects all overset; once more uncertain, even for the nearest Future&#x201D; (<date when="1835-07-15">15 July</date>).</note></p>
<p>Jack has hardly much news from Munich, except the assurance that he is well and thinking of us; which is always welcome intelligence. I had written to him, for Geneva, about the very time he wrote this; probably he may be there by this time, and have got it: but their movements seem uncertain for these last weeks. I have little doubt, his poor Countess is mainly kept from England by her Husband&#x2019;s sudden return; tho&#x2019; Jack, till he get my Geneva Letter, may be quite ignorant of such a fact. She is really to be <hi rend="italic">pitied</hi>, tho&#x2019; she disarranges us all: if our regret at the postponement of a brother&#x2019;s return be naturally great at the moment, what must hers be to see herself (by some mysterious reason, which she reckons binding) shut out altogether from return, from <hi rend="italic">all</hi> her friends, for a time she cannot fix! Jack says, he has &#x201C;made up his mind&#x201D; what to do, in either case, let her return to Rome, or come hither. I wish he had told us <hi rend="italic">what</hi> his mind was, that he had made up; for there is no fixed light that I can get on it from this Letter or any other. I suppose it may be that he will demand &#xa3;500 from her, if she be for Rome again; or perhaps liberty to practice which latter I fancy she might make most difficulty about. It is needless to conjecture what he will do or she: my guess rather is that he will come home and let it go its way, he taking his. In the last Letter, we (Jane and I conjointly) after clearly advising him <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go under &#xa3;500, explained to him how he might take up house with us here, set his Doctor&#x2019;s-Plate on the door, and try his hand. It will cost a very small sum of money; we have houseroom enough, we have some friends: Jane even wrote to him that she had &#x201C;got him one patient bespoken,&#x201D; which was a fact (Mrs Sterling being the <hi rend="italic">one</hi>). I am not sure but it were literally the best thing he could do. However, after explaining it all with the best accuracy I was capable of, I gave no advice, but left it to his own determination, praying very heartily that <hi rend="italic">that</hi> might be guided by a Higher Direction. So we will leave it there; till a few weeks unfold the mystery. You can look at the view of Munich Town on the top of his sheet (a very good device that, creditable to the Paper-maker); and enjoy the innocent <pb id="pg-08-179" n="08:179"/>record of what he is doing and enjoying there; or rather <hi rend="italic">was</hi>, for, likely, it is over now.</p>
<p>Before I forget, let me tell you about that money, which he wants sent to you. It will be too late the first Wednesday; but on Wednesday next after that, which I think is the <date when="1835-07-29">29<hi rend="italic">th</hi> day of the month</date>, you will find it waiting for you. Ask for &#x201C;one hundred and forty pounds&#x201D; payable to yourself &#x201C;Mrs Margaret Carlyle.&#x201D; James Aitken will go with you, and manage it exactly as the last was done: enter it on their receipt-books in the name of Dr Carlyle Rome, with interest payable to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. James can clap a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">right</hi>&#x201D; somewhere on the next Newspaper, and I shall be satisfied. The interest will &#x201C;keep you in tobacco&#x201D;; which is better than doing nothing at all here.</p>
<p>I fancy you may possibly be up in that side of the Country then, at any rate. Mrs Welsh informs us she has sent for you to Templand, which I hope you resolved to go and visit again. She was for you &#x201C;a couple of weeks&#x201D; with her; but that can be as the spirit moves yourself and her when there. At all events, however, I hope you will go. She is to come up hither, and will bring us news of you. Tell her if she still hesitate, that she <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come; there is no other resource for it. Jane is quite off the thought of coming this year; and as Mrs Welsh proposes visiting London sometime at any rate, there is surely no time so suitable as this. She must bundle, therefore, and get under way.</p>
<p>How long is it, dear Mother, since I now had a scrape of a pen from you? Not one of them has written to me; were it not for the two scratches of Jean&#x2019;s hand weekly, I could not know what evil might not have befallen one or all of you. I will not blame <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> for I know it is the ability not the will that fails: nevertheless do set about it, with your own hand, you there; it is only difficult not impossible. I want greatly to know how you get on in your two Scotsbrig Rooms; how your health is; what you are employed with,&#x2014;whether my winter coat is spun; and a thousand things. You must really write.&#x2014; M&#x2019;Diarmid says there is very bad hay-weather;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1835-07-15">15 July</date>, had reported the hay harvest &#x201C;sadly interrupted&#x201D; by rain, and that at least a third of the crop could not be cut.</note> so I must imagine James and men weltering occasionally, not in the best humour, among wet swathes. Let him be patient and <foreign>canny</foreign>; it might have been worse.&#x2014; I am very anxious about Alick, to learn how he fare at Annan; what his outlooks are there. Tell him, in my name, to let nothing dishearten him, tho&#x2019; many things combine against him. It is a very truth that Time and Chance do happen to all men;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 9:11.</note> lucky Chance, as well as <pb id="pg-08-180" n="08:180"/>unlucky. The brave &#x201C;little stool&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained nickname for Alick; possibly from being sturdy like a stool; cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340530-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:198</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-30">30 May 1834</date></corr></ref> where Carlyle applies it to Harry, the horse.</note> shall not be beaten: he has a heart and hands, and the world is wide. Jack, I find, dislikes Cattle-dealing too; but agrees to the plain fact that even it is better than idleness. Like all earthly employments, it may be pursued in two ways, wisely and in the spirit of truth and soberness, or foolishly and with the fruits of folly. Give my kind brotherly love to Alick and his household; and bid him write by his earliest leisure.&#x2014; I get no newspapers now; so you must make my explanation to all I was wont to visit in that way. Except for that use I hardly regret the want of <hi rend="italic">Globes</hi>. They were very uninteresting to me; wearisome with their endless jargoning and &#x201C;threshing of the straw&#x201D;: except when rather idle, I did not read much of them. Mill is not to be back for some four weeks yet. His <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> is going on; but rather languidly I think: it is but a languid concern in itself; dull angry radical men most of them, not worth naming where men were. Mill does his own best, and is the main stay of it. I have written nothing yet, and shall be in no great hurry till I see farther.</p>
<p>You have heard that I am working again. I prosper considerably better than formerly; and see the weary <hi rend="italic">day&#x2019;rk</hi> [day&#x2019;s work] growing gradually a little less. By Heaven&#x2019;s favour, I shall <hi rend="italic">be</hi> thro&#x2019; it; and surely not forget it for a long while! Nay, if I can have it done, as I first proposed, before coming off to Scotland, that will really be far better. I go jogging on, at any rate, according to ability; and no man should ask more of me.&#x2014; My health is decidedly better than it then was. Indeed, this Summer, which has been so unthrifty for your fields, has answered me and our streets much better than last did: there is always wind blowing, breath to be had; the pavements seldom get <hi rend="italic">burning</hi> hot; one can quite readily endure it. The summer has been changeable; but we have evidently a third less of <hi rend="italic">rainy</hi> weather than you. Sometimes I do not go out at all till the evening; and then a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> roam over &#x201C;the Parks&#x201D;; a beautiful region, one of the main &#x201C;temporal blessings&#x201D; of these parts. Hyde Park itself is a fine expanse of smooth sward, with noble clumps of oaks and other towering wood; I should think nearly <hi rend="italic">three times</hi> as big as all Scotsbrig farm. You can think what a comfort that is, close upon the dusty streets. Wellington&#x2019;s House is at the Corner of it, two miles from this. We went into it (having got an &#x201C;order,&#x201D; by favour of the Sterlings) to see the furnishing out of the Tables for his grand Waterloo Dinner, which he gives yearly: it was the richest thing to be seen anywhere; more <pb id="pg-08-181" n="08:181"/>gold-plate, vases and splendours than I shall ever have occasion for.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Duke of Wellington had given his Banquet for General Officers and Officers of Staff who had served at Waterloo at Apsley House on <date when="1835-06-18">18 June</date>, the twentieth anniversary. It was attended by William IV. According to the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, <date when="1835-07-19">19 July</date>, &#x201C;dinner was served in the Waterloo Gallery&#x201D; for sixty to seventy guests.</note> The Duke himself was visible for a moment; a tough-looking old steel-grey figure; really &#x201C;one of the tightest old quarry-boys in the whole Howerigg.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps quoting his father, once a mason.</note> Since that, I saw a Grand Review in Hyde Park, where the veteran was again.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Friday, <date when="1835-07-10">10 July</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, that evening, reported &#x201C;a grand review&#x201D; which &#x201C;took place this morning in Hyde Park. The Duke of Wellington &#x2026; arrived on the ground at eleven o&#x2019;clock, and his Majesty &#x2026; about half an hour afterwards. &#x2026; Great numbers of people had arrived in the Park at an early hour.&#x201D;</note> The people ran round him (when it was all done) huzzaing; at which he seemed to me not unlike <foreign><hi rend="italic">greeting</hi></foreign> [weeping]; he lifted his hand refusingly from time to time; was <hi rend="italic">chewing</hi> with his toothless lips; nostrils inflated, colour going and coming: I felt kindly drawn towards the old man. He is honest I do think, in his fashion; he had fought his way round half the terrestrial Globe, and was got <hi rend="italic">that</hi> length; and at no great distance (from him and me) lay&#x2014;Eternity too!&#x2014; The old King<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William IV.</note> came driving to the ground, near where I was standing: he was in regimentals with a most copious plume of feathers, so that while he sat all shrunk together in the open Carriage, you saw little else but a <foreign>lock</foreign> [lot] of feathers, and might have taken our Defender of the Faith for some singular species of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Clocker</hi></foreign> [brood hen] coming thither. On dismounting, he shewed an innocent respectable old face; straddled out his legs greatly (which seemed weak), rested on his heels, <foreign><hi rend="italic">stiddering</hi></foreign>[supporting] himself, and looked round with much simplicity what they wanted next with him. The Review itself was a wheeling and marching of foot and horse, several thousands; a flaring and a blaring from trumpet and drum, with artillery-vollies, sham-charges, and then a continued explosion of musketry and cannon from the whole posse of them, like a long explosion of Mount AEtna: all very grand.</p>
<p>And so enough of clatter! Jane should be here now very soon, or should already have been here: at all events I am tired. I declare there she <hi rend="italic">is!</hi> Exactly at the right moment! down to open!&#x2014; (The Sterlings sent their coach, and I heard wheels.)</p>
<p><date when="1835-07-20">20th July</date>.&#x2014; My Dear Mother,&#x2014;there is little to be added today, after the copious details of last night, cut short in that way, in the nick of time. I meant to write a fraction of a Note to Jean at Dumfries: <pb id="pg-08-182" n="08:182"/>tell her so, and to take the will for the deed. I cannot do it today; my work is all lying about me, not progressing in the best way, and I must go out with this to have it franked, and also for the sake of a walk. Tell her farther that I know not whether she is in my debt or I in hers; but I <hi rend="italic">desire</hi> her to write to me, and <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>. Remember us kindly to Mary; say that I hope to breakfast with her yet this year, and eat of her <foreign><hi rend="italic">banna&#x2019;</hi></foreign> [bannock]. What is Jenny doing? Is she at Dumfries?&#x2014; Have you ever been at the Sea-bathing yet? You are more convenient now than ever; I am persuaded, it will do you good.&#x2014; If you see Grahame tell him that I meditate writing, and regret that <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> is still the only way of communicating between us.&#x2014; Now write, dear Mother! Take care of yourself; keep up your heart, and I will not <foreign><hi rend="italic">tine</hi></foreign> [lose] mine. God be with you, my dear Mother!&#x2014; Jane sends her loving regards to all of you. <closer><salute>I am Ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> as you anticipated, has come precisely on the Monday; not long after noon. I fling aside my papers, take out this sheet (which happens to be the last) and will answer you on the instant. The French Post departs now daily; I will up to Charing Cross this evening; and shall hope to be still in time. Would also that it were the last foreign Letter I had to write to you: the prelude of home <hi rend="italic">speech!</hi></p>
<p>The news you send us are as satisfactory as we could hope. <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> resolution is taken; wisely, as I think; other persons, and other things, will resolve themselves as they can. My prediction again begins to be that your next route will be <hi rend="italic">homewards</hi>. Heaven send it, safe and soon! It is quite right what you determine about going idle. Nothing can reward a man for doing nothing! The significance of life is a doing <hi rend="italic">something</hi>. One gets food and lodging, and is found <hi rend="italic">living</hi> this way or that, with what <foreign><hi rend="italic">Thatkraft</hi></foreign> [energy] one has realised, with what <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi> one has done therewith. I feel more and more of a settled <pb id="pg-08-183" n="08:183"/>humour in that particular. Much I can even <hi rend="italic">thank</hi> that it has been so kind as grow the worst possible; it will take its way, and I shall know what is mine. There seems to me not a &#x201C;chance,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had probably used this word in his lost letter.</note> but a perennial behest and invitation for such workman as you, in this place: if the place do little for you, you shall do much for the place. Men are sick and distracted, bewildered, bequacked, bedevilled: come and help them if you can! All men&#x2019;s works are as <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> (the very <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and Gospel of Saint Matthew will one day <hi rend="italic">not be</hi>); and yet, in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> true work, there is such an <hi rend="italic">everlasting something</hi>. Let the vanity be killed out of us, were it with whatever pain; let us go on working, in patience, in the name of God.&#x2014; These things we shall yet peaceably speak of and <hi rend="italic">do:</hi> if it be God&#x2019;s will.</p>
<p>We had a Letter from Jean, not long ago; and more lately one from Mrs Welsh.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neither letter has been found.</note> Jean writes in the most sensible, practical manner; giving good account of everything: she is well, and they are all going on quite tolerably well. Alick she sees almost weekly; he does not like cattle-dealing, and she is not sorry that it has hitherto been unproductive for him. He had been over at some Cumberland Fair, and seen our Brother John,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Half-brother, of Cockermouth.</note> whose family and self seemed to be thriving. Mary was well, and her husband (with two horses) got ample work. Jamie sat at Scotsbrig, calling his first-born &#x201C;a squealing vermin,&#x201D; yet much delighted to see it. Jenny and our Mother were at Dumfries at the moment; on their way to Templand, on Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s pressing invitation: our Mother fully as well as usual (she has now <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the &#xa3;140, and put it in the Bank, according to rule; tho&#x2019; she had not then).&#x2014; Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s Letter continued the history for another week: there had been such driving in Cuddy-Carts [donkey-carts], administering of blue pills with the best effect (on Jenny), visitings to Mrs Glendinning;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320821-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:205</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1832-08-21">21 Aug. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> good looks, expressions of &#x201C;wonder at being so happy,&#x201D; then farings off in the Glendinning Coach (free of cost,&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">money</hi>, or to the farers),&#x2014;as really were pleasant to hear of. I think all that we love are very tolerably well.&#x2014; Lastly Mrs Welsh, disappointed of seeing Jane, is actually coming off hither; by the Edinburgh Steamboat: I hope you will meet her here, you well, her well. There will be beds for all,&#x2014;or we can even swing in hammocks: had we but <hi rend="italic">met!</hi></p>
<p>So is it about Dumfriesshire. As for Chelsea and London, you already <pb id="pg-08-184" n="08:184"/>guess the main part of the tidings. Since the day your Letter last but one came, I have sat by this desk (with a holiday on ending a Chapter, or so); struggling at that unspeakable Task. I trust, I shall never in Time have such another. Occasionally it has been disagreeable beyond speech. The best of it is, however, that except one (longish) chapter, and some two days of another, it is <hi rend="italic">done!</hi> The thing is worse, not very much worse, than it was; but anyway it will stand again on paper, and I shall <hi rend="italic">crow day;</hi> relieved from the unspeakablest load. At the time of your return to us (would we saw that!) I hope to have finished; to be ready to rejoice in all points! There is then a period of recreation and vacation; afterwards, a steady spell (of work that I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the nature of); and so the Book is off <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the hands of whosoever has business with it. Sometimes I think it possible the world may take notice of the Book; sometimes no notice: either way, my contentment is great, had I it but <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. Literature, after that, must go its way for a while: I, expecting simple Nothing of it, shall not be disappointed. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hoffentlich</hi></foreign>[Hopefully] there are other ways of living; other way of dying there at lowest is. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Es geh wie es gehen will</hi></foreign> [Go it as it may]!</p>
<p>One day about three weeks ago, walking in the Park (Jane and I), there came a <foreign><hi rend="italic">stoory</hi></foreign> [dusty] withered-looking man up to us: he was David Aitken, the Reverend of Minto.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270217-TC-DA-01"><sic>4:192</sic><corr>TC to DA, <date when="1827-02-17">17 Feb. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> Some Cambridge &#x201C;Installation&#x201D; or such like being toward, he had started off; then lengthened his route so far. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stoory</hi></foreign> was poor David; <foreign><hi rend="italic">reisted</hi></foreign> [dusty] in body and in mind. He came down another day, and sat. Bad work in Scotland;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bitterness of conflict in Scotland which was to lead to the Disruption of the Church of Scotland, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, had already begun.

There is not perhaps so pure and clear a little creature left in that Establishment,&#x2014;the course of which seems fast bending downwards. David walked with me to take a glance at our Hospital (built by Wren; handsome, tho&#x2019; of red bricks);<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340617-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:215</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-06-17">17 June 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> then went on his way.</p>
<p>I had a Letter from Boston in America, with the signature &#x201C;George Ripley&#x201D;; full of the most enthusiastic estimation; really a good feeling ill-expressed, struggling for expression: <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k he calls &#x201C;a crying out of the heart and the flesh for the living God&#x201D;; one of the chief signs of the Era, &#x26;c &#x26;c; and withal bids me by the name of Brother, go on in God&#x2019;s name, and falter for no man. Ripley seems to be a Clergyman of some Church (I think Emerson mentioned him to me): his Letter gave me no comfort at the time, it seemed so overdone; but it does now occasionally some, when I think of it.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Ripley (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>), a Unitarian minister of Boston; see also <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June</date></ref>. Ripley&#x2019;s long letter from Boston, <date when="1835-06-01">1 June 1835</date> is too important not to be given in full here as it shows the enthusiastic admiration of Carlyle&#x2019;s young disciples in New England when <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> had not been generally accepted as a notable book. It has been edited by Joseph Slater, <hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi>, LXVII (<date when="1952-06-00">June 1952</date>), 341&#x2013;44.<lb/><lb/>
<salute>My dear Sir</salute><lb/>
I am impelled by a yearning sympathy, to raise my voice to your ear across the wide waste of waters over which the music of your soul-melody has sounded to this distant spot. I cannot address you as a stranger for the revelations of your mind have long been to me a source of the highest inspiration and joy. I have communed with your spirit in the utterance of its deep wisdom, and when I have felt the significance of your mystic sayings, my heart has leaped up with the response, &#x201C;This unknown Being is my Brother.&#x201D; The sentiment of reverence and awe has filled my soul when Idea after Idea from the Primal Fountain of Truth has flashed upon me from your kindling page, and I have felt that I would traverse forests and cross the ocean to express my gratitude to such a gifted Teacher of Humanity.<lb/><lb/>
Allow me, Sir, with the plainness of our plain-spoken land to relate to you the successive steps of my acquaintance-ship with your mind. Several years since with only a prophetic sense of the untold treasures of German thought, I read your article on German Literature in the Edinburgh. I was then a babe in <pb id="pg-08-186" n="08:186"/>this kind of knowledge, but felt at once the strongest sympathy with your views. The cares of life, and its urgent duties, prevented me at that time, from studying in this department with due diligence, but every voice of encomium on what I considered my morning-star, was like words of encouragement from a mother&#x2019;s lips. I read, times without number, your defense of a nation and a literature, which a narrow prejudice had proscribed, but which I saw as &#x201C;through a glass darkly&#x201D; was instinct with a holy and a living spirit. The magnificent article on Burns came next. I cannot tell the joy with which I hailed it as the rising of a new light in our dark time. Then came Schiller&#x2019;s Life. By a happy accident I was the first to discover it in a neglected corner of a Book-seller&#x2019;s shop. I did not know the Author&#x2019;s name, nor that the Reviewer and the Biographer were the same person. That pure, monumental structure of whitest marble to the memory of Schiller, filled me with Reverence and Love towards the Poet, and his Biographer. The casual English copy which had come into my hands, was soon diffused through a wide circle of friends, and read and extolled with most disinterested but enthusiastic admiration. Since that time, you may perhaps be aware, a beautiful Edition has been published here and ranks among our most popular works. I have no space to tell you of the effect of your different Reviews, which after some time, I learned to ascribe to their true author.&#x2014; Let me pass them over and come at once to Teufelsdr&#xF6;ck&#x2014;dear, genial, mis-interpreted, much abused, long-suffering Teufelsdrock. My studies had led me in a different direction, &#x26; it is only within a few months, that I have read &#x201C;Sartor Resartus.&#x201D; I regard it as the most significant indication of the present Age. It stands there, alone, a huge, mysterious, magnificent Symbol of the Time upon which we have fallen. It is the cry of the Heart &#x26; the Flesh for the Living God. England, my Brother! fellow Spirit of the Eternal,&#x2014;has for more than one century, been hemmed in with the Finite, girt around with the brazen walls of Custom, she has had no sense &#x26; no soul for the voice of the Infinite, which is sounding forth from this vocal Universe. Your ear has tuned itself to catch the Echoes, which come from beyond the shores of Time. The Ocean-melody from its mysterious depths has been poured into your Soul, and you are seeking fit utterance therefor. God speed thee,&#x2014;Brother&#x2014;God, of whom you are an inspired Prophet, a true Shekinah. I see the Urim and Thummin written on thy brow. Go on in the strength of that Spirit, whose Son you are, keep thyself pure, be not afraid of their faces, and declare the whole counsel of God whether men will hear or whether they will forbear. Go on with your &#x201C;plough&#x201D; and &#x201C;sower&#x2019;s shirt,&#x201D; the seed-corn [see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340812-TC-RWE-01"><sic>7:264</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1834-08-12">12 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>] will fall beside many waters, and He who is our Informing Life will give the increase.<lb/><lb/>
I have feebly expressed what was in my heart. I should not have ventured to obtrude myself upon your attention, strongly as my gratitude and reverence might have impelled me, had not the recent sight of your handwriting lent me a new motive. A letter of yours to my friend R. W. Emerson, has convinced me that you are an actual Incarnation, and not merely a Presence and a Force, sent to say, &#x201C;Let there be Light,&#x201D; but invisible t<supplied>[o the]</supplied> fleshly eye. Do not think me extravagant. I can never think of a grea<supplied>[t]</supplied> author, whose words speak to my soul, other than as a Spirit, until I have had some indication of his earthly &#x201C;environment.&#x201D; Of yours I had not the slightest until Mr E. told me of your &#x201C;<foreign>Ubi</foreign>&#x201D; &#x26; <foreign>Quomodo</foreign>,&#x201D; and more than all, your own words to him assure me that my uncalled for sympathy will not be refused.<lb/><lb/>
I will not come into the presence of a Great Man without a gift, however poor. The accompanying article from one of our periodicals, the fruit of leisure hours gained for genial studies from the &#x201C;bread-pursuits&#x201D; of a busy but delightful profession, I beg you to accept. With the deepest love of the Transcendental, the strongest convictions of its Importance &#x26; its Truth, it is my life&#x2019;s labor &#x26; my privilege to present the simplest view of Divine Truth, from a pulpit, where, Sir, I trust we have &#x201C;solemnity without mumming&#x201D; [see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340812-TC-RWE-01"><sic>7:265</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1834-08-12">12 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>], and a living Spirit instead of a dead Letter. My daily duties call me often to the abodes of the ignorant, to communion with dark &#x26; coarse minds, to intercourse with the afflicted, the sick, &#x26; the dying, and thank God I have never yet seen the time, when the Primal Truths of a Divine Philosophy left the soul barren or were destitute of power to touch and bless Humanity, even in its most forbidding forms.<lb/><lb/>
My dear Sir, I feel sure that you will pardon my uninvited visit to the sanctuary of your mind, for though a pilgrim from a far land I come with deep veneration &#x26; love, counting it a sufficient privilege to have brought my offering, and hailed you as a Teacher, whose Star shining in this distant West, has led me to your abode. With the repeated prayer, God speed thee, my Brother in the great hope of Humanity, <closer><salute>I subscribe myself / Most gratefully &#x26; sincerely yours,</salute></closer><lb/><lb/>

John Sterling has taken a house in Bayswater; is to be here very soon. That also, I imagine, is a future friend for you: there never came athwart me a man of a finer, open guileless, all-hoping, lymphatic-sanguineous temper; one fears only that his Church-profession may prove questionable in these times; that his very life (he so headlong, excitable, his element so confused) may not hold out with him.&#x2014; Mill has been on the Rhin<supplied>[e]</supplied> as I said; probably we may see him back one of these very days. C. Buller has gone to the Country (&#x201C;on circuit&#x201D;); Mrs B. looks but feeble, and lives amid nothing but unwholesome clangour, of O&#x2019;Connellism and so forth; has dismissed <hi rend="italic">homoepathy;</hi> consents to be sick, on common medicine. The Austins were here; but are gone: to Boulogne now; where if you waited you might call for them. Mrs A. is a really good woman; nearly ruined by being &#x201C;a distinguished female.&#x201D; Henry Taylor we still see occasionally; a wholesome Northman, full of stubborn English stuff, of the slow, quiet, almost dull sort, yet which is not dull. I read his &#x201C;Poem&#x201D;;<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably <hi rend="italic">Philip van Artevelde;</hi> see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350216-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref></note> feeling that the <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, tho&#x2019; he could <supplied>[write]</supplied> no poem, would not have written No<hi rend="italic">thing:</hi> as it proved.

Hunt sits near us, radiating good wishes; seldom comes, for reasons known to himself. He is one of the cleverest men I ever spoke with: but unfortunately <hi rend="italic">Cockney-bred;</hi> let him <foreign><hi rend="italic">gehen in seiner Stelle</hi></foreign> [go in his place].&#x2014; Here is a <hi rend="italic">rap</hi> at the door! I suppose, I must leave you.&#x2014; It was only worthy Mr Dunn and his wife come to ask us to Tea on Friday night: Jane was out;&#x2014;and they went in a minute. I finish my pellmell rubbish-cart of news, by telling you more specially whither Jane is gone. To Marlborough Street, to the Bolognese Contessa&#x2019;s (<hi rend="italic">degli Antoni</hi> whom I told you once of), for an Italian Lesson! She volunteered to teach the poor Countess and Chauntress (and even Enchantress for she is that too) a mouthful of English; but the degli Antoni insisted on <hi rend="italic">first</hi> teaching <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Italian (a most necessary preliminary); and so they go, Jane learning with amazing rapidity, but still in <foreign><hi rend="italic">una confusione siccome nella Torre di Babele</hi></foreign> [a confusion like that of the Tower of Babel]! That <foreign><hi rend="italic">Torre di Babele</hi></foreign>, enounced with the right musical accentuation (for I too heard it), still sings in my ears, and has made me laugh a score of times.</p>
<p>I shall not succeed in gathering up this poor straggle of a letter now. I am in haste; and the day is hot, hot. We have suffered abundantly from heat and drought, these late weeks. The Parks are brown bare as an old scratch-wig; give dust if you stamp on them; are rent into cracks. Our Springs have not failed; but they say it is not so, in the South, where the people (as in Picardy, Normandy too) are ill off that way. Many a day, I do not go out at all till sunset: this day I have fled into the back-room; a bedroom (intended to be yours!); I look out on trees, grown dingy, but still trees; the sun, roasting, gives me a headache on the other side of the house. In Scotland they complained of <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> not long ago, and did not know their mercies.&#x2014; Have I mentioned anywhere that the King is (said to be) &#x201C;going to change his Ministry in eight days?&#x201D;<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Whig government under Lord Melbourne had a precarious majority, yet the Municipal Corporation Bill (a reform-act for local government) had passed its second reading in the House of Commons on <date when="1835-06-15">15 June</date> with Peel&#x2019;s cooperation. But the ultra-Tories, dominating the House of Lords, followed a deliberately obstructive policy. All through <date when="1835-08-00">August</date> the press speculated about how they might provoke a constitutional crisis by finally rejecting the bill and defeating the government.

We have not seen Miss Morris; and fancy she must be out of Town.</p>
<p>I fear Jane will not be home in time to give you any postscript: her love you may authentically regard as sent. She is ill off at present about servants: the one we had (who suited very well) had to go off to Deptford, to wait on a sick Mother, and is not like to come back. Jane has written to Miss Donaldson<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a relative of Alexander Donaldson of Haddington, the Welshes&#x2019; family lawyer. Jane&#x2019;s letter has not been found.</note> to get her an East Lothian one, and ship her hither.

It is really <hi rend="italic">true;</hi> but not quite convenient at present.&#x2014; I like very well the temper you are in towards your Lady and all that <foreign><hi rend="italic">umgebung</hi></foreign> [environment].

The passage from Carlyle&#x2019;s letter given here is quoted by Ripley in his letter to Emerson of <date when="1835-10-05">5 Oct.</date> See R. L. Rusk, ed., <hi rend="italic">The Letters of Ralph Waldo Emerson</hi> (New York, <date when="1939-00-00">1939</date>), I, 432&#x2013;33 n. The rest of Ripley&#x2019;s letter reads as follows:<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;I presume that I have no reason to expect you in Boston at present, and I therefore take this opportunity to inform you, that I received a letter from Carlyle, a few days since, containing some special messages to you, which of course you will like to hear. I copy word for word the following passages, which are all that relate directly to yourself. The whole of the letter, which is in the Teufelsdr&#xF6;ck vein, is at your service, when you come in town. [Here Ripley inserts the passage from Carlyle&#x2019;s letter.]<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;So much for the prospect of seeing your friend on this side of the sea. Mr. A. Everett told me the other day, that he had sent him a copy of his Review of Sartor Resartus, with a letter, encouraging him to visit America. Perhaps, the friendly notice in the N.A. may inspire the Booksellers with courage to reprint the Sartor. F. H. Hedge told me that he had almost concluded to put it to press on his own risk. It will be a curious fact, if Carlyle, as well as Coleridge &#x26; Wordsworth should find his warmest admirers in old Massachusetts, but according to all appearance this is likely to be the case.&#x201D;<lb/><lb/>
Everett&#x2019;s review &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle&#x201D; appeared in the <hi rend="italic">North American Review</hi>, XLI (<date when="1835-10-00">Oct. 1835</date>), 454&#x2013;82: see Jules Seigel, <hi rend="italic">Thomas Carlyle: The Critical Heritage</hi> (London, <date when="1971-00-00">1971</date>), pp. 34&#x2013;43.

<p>On my side, as Emerson may have explained to you, I entertain always the project of looking on America one day, where now year <pb id="pg-08-192" n="08:192"/>after year I hear of new friends awaiting me. It is very &#x201C;romantic&#x201D; as they call it, and yet it is very just &#x26; true; brethren of the same blood, separated only by a piece of salt water (which they are learning to cross) and by parchment treaties, which to me are mainly pieces of sheepskin stained with copperas! Let us love one another, and forward one another as we can, as it is commanded us. x x x&#x2014;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ripley&#x2019;s substitute for ellipses. For the commandment, cf. John 13:34.</note> You are likely to see my worthy Emerson. Pray tell him that he has still no chance to be forgotten here. We hope he is wedded before this time &#x26; as happy as he ought to be. He &#x26; I had some correspondence about my coming to Boston this very winter. I have written him, (if I remember) two letters about it; the last full of mere uncertainty, but promising another so soon as there came any clearness. Will you tell him that it seems to be as good as settled, that I shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get across this winter, and fully likelier than ever that I shall next winter. The medical brother of whom I wrote to him is still at Geneva only, all in uncertainty; I meanwhile had to make up my mind to recommence my poor <hi rend="italic">burnt manuscript</hi> (of which E. knows enough;) you can add that before you read this to him the burnt ashes have again grown <hi rend="italic">leaves</hi> after a sort; that the ugliest task ever set me is got done. Whereupon I determine that the Book of the French Revolution shall be written <hi rend="italic">out</hi> before I leave it. Almost two volumes still to do; &#x26; no prospect whatever to be counted on but that of getting delivered from them! However, it may be long before the Upper Powers set one down with <hi rend="italic">tools</hi> for another such task: having begun it, let us end it; and then&#x2014;?</p>

<p>Even the doubt, expressed in your last letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> about the durability of my affection was more agreeable to me than the brief notice <pb id="pg-08-193" n="08:193"/>which you usually put me off with, &#x201C;remember us to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x2014;,&#x201D;or still worse&#x2014;&#x201C;remember us to <hi rend="italic">your Lady</hi>.&#x201D; I have told you often, that it afflicts me to be always, in the matter of correspondence with you, obliged like the Annandale man to thank God &#x201C;for the blessings made to pass <hi rend="italic">over my head</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign>Extempore</foreign> public-prayer, once <hi rend="italic">really</hi>&#x2014;&#x2018;Lord we thank thee for &#x26;c &#x26;c the many blessings thou art making to pass over our heads&#x2019;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> It <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> not perhaps to make any particular difference whether your letters be addressed to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> or me but it <hi rend="italic">does</hi>&#x2014;You never in your life <hi rend="italic">answered</hi> a letter of <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> (and I have written you several) except little business notes from Dumfries, which could not be considered any <hi rend="italic">voluntary</hi> expression of kind remembrance.&#x2014; Had you even expressed a wish to hear from me since I came here; I would nevertheless have written, being of a disposition to receive thankfully the smallest mercies, when greater are denied&#x2014;but as I said you have always put me off with a bare recognition of my existence which was small <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;encooragement.&#x201D;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Cumberland man (to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>) concern<hi rend="italic">g</hi> a Squire whose son &#x26; he had quite quarrelled: &#x2018;Feayther gives him naa encoorage<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x2019;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> The fact is we are both of us I believe too proud: we go upon the notion of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;keeping up our dignity Mr Arnot.&#x201D;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Arnot&#x2019;s a little <foreign>Laird</foreign>, come almost to starvat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, by drinking &#x26;c,&#x2014;a poor creditor, <hi rend="italic">un</hi>payable, overheard Mrs A whispering, &#x2018;Let us keep&#x2019; &#x26;c&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> <hi rend="italic">You</hi> have it by inheritance from your Mother who (as I have often told herself) with a great profession of humility is swallowed up in this sin; and I have possibly been seduced into it, by her example which I was simple enough to consider a safe one to imitate in all respects.</p>
<p>For my part however, I am quite willing to enter into a compact with you henceforth to resist the Devil&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in so far</hi> as he interferes with our mutual good understanding; for few things were more pleasant for me than to <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;tell you sundry news of every kind no rather every thought which enters in within this shallow mind:</hi><supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Some old <hi rend="italic">Child&#x2019;s verses</hi> of this same &#x2018;Craw Jean&#x2019; (Consid<hi rend="italic">ly</hi> laughed at and admired by us in their time)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).

<p>I have been fidgeted with another change of servants&#x2014; The woman recommended to me by Mrs Austin&#x2014;turned out the best servant I had ever had, tho a rather unamiable person in temper.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza.</note> We got on however quite harmoniously and the affairs of the house were conducted to my entire satisfaction.&#x2014;When suddenly she was sent for home to attend a sick Mother, and after three weeks absence during which time I had to find a chair-woman to supply her place she sent me word the other day that in the state of uncertainty she was kept in she could not expect her place to remain longer vacant for her. The next day I lighted on an active tidy looking Irish Roman catholic&#x2014;in a way so singular that I could not help considering her as intended for me by Providence&#x2014;and boding well of our connexion&#x2014; She is not come yet but will be here on Wednesday&#x2014;and in the mean while my chair-woman, who has her family in the work house, does quite tolerably.</p>

<salute>My Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>An opportunity for getting a Frank having arrived I must send this off almost without a word from me: the man of franks (he is one Gibson,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Gibson, who, according to a note which Carlyle wrote for <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351012-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-12">12 Oct.</date></ref>, &#x201C;was a massive, easy, friendly, dull person, physically one of the best washed I ever saw; American merchant, &#x2018;who had made, and again lost, three fortunes&#x2019;; originally a Nithsdale pedlar boy, &#x2018;Black Wull,&#x2019; by title; &#x2018;Silver Packman,&#x2019; he was often called here.&#x201D; His expressions are often quoted by Jane Carlyle later. The signature franking the letter is clear and presumably that of Walter Francis, 5th Duke of Buccleuch (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), using one of his other titles, Earl of Doncaster.</note> who is to get it done for me) sends up <hi rend="italic">this</hi> instant that he is in haste!</p>
<p>Thanks my dear Sister for your very reasonable, sensible solid Letter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> communicating so much clear intelligence. I see you are still a &#x201C;judicious <hi rend="italic">Craw</hi>,&#x201D; as of old. Be a good wife to your goodman, always acting towards the <hi rend="italic">common</hi> interest, not your own special one: and may all good be with you.</p>
<p>You will find by Jack&#x2019;s Letter that there is tolerable chance of our coming &#x201C;after all, Mother.&#x201D; I almost mean to come myself (or rather <hi rend="italic">do</hi> mean it) if the Doctor even cannot yet.&#x2014;You will send this letter to our Mother; probably the very Wednesday you get it? Also Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s (which has lain here some time) by Andrew.&#x2014; Remember me very specially to Alick: give him all of them my brotherly blessings; my hope to see them soon.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I daresay you are wearying to hear from me; and certainly I am wearying very much to write to you; for it is a long time since I have had any free exposition with you about much that is lying dubious. I must give you tonight, in very brief hurried terms some light as to what you are to expect about our Annandale visit, and other procedure;&#x2014;or rather, alas, not <hi rend="italic">light</hi> so much as &#x201C;darkness visible&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, I, 63.</note> since it is still all the most confused dubious business I almost ever had to do with. How we have been driven hither and thither these many weeks; and, after all, have passed the summer not in green breezy Scotland, but in this Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s Furnace of a London! Greatly to all our sorrow. Had Her Ladyship of Clare but been able to make up her mind, and let us know it from the beginning! I, as one individual, would have set out without asking leave of her. But it seems we are to have nothing but confusion of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to the very end of the Chapter.</p>
<p>However, before you read that Letter, the most confused that Jack almost ever sent us,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1835-08-08">8 Aug.</date>, written from Geneva, in which he said that Lady Clare, still in Geneva, had decided that she would soon go to Munich, without a physician if necessary, and that a month or two later would go to Rome. He had then written to her as follows: &#x201C;Permit me to say that I think it would be extremely unsafe for you to travel alone to Rome in the month of <date when="1835-11-00">November</date>. &#x2026; If you will consent to my being absent for a month to see my friends I shall return and accompany you to Rome on the terms you proposed&#x2014;namely of having my present salary continued till the month of <date when="1835-12-00">December</date> next and my expences paid from Rome to England.&#x2014;If you were once fairly in Rome again it might perhaps be even better for your health to have no physician living with you. In case of necessity there would be plenty of English physicians at hand.&#x201D; He added that Lady Clare had agreed to his proposal, that they were to go to Chamonix the next week, and that on <date when="1835-08-17">17</date> or <date when="1835-08-18">18 Aug.</date> he would start for London. But in a long addition he says he has learned of the threat of cholera in Italy and that he must stay with Lady Clare for the present. &#x201C;We must have patience a month or two longer!&#x201D; he writes. &#x201C;It would be a full compensation to me for the loss of my intended visit to you, if you would come and spend the month of <date when="1835-10-00">October</date> with me in Munich, and would allow me to pay for your expenses as you have so often done for me.&#x201D;</note> I must tell you a little about what is fixed and <pb id="pg-08-200" n="08:200"/>positive, what I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> tell you of. Understand then that, by Heaven&#x2019;s blessing, I shall in three or four days, <hi rend="italic">be done with that burnt Manuscript;</hi> have it off my hands again, and so be quit of the ugliest burden that ever lay on me in that kind! My progress has been difficult, small, and sorely interrupted; but to that length I have got, and am thankful. The moment I am done, which will surely be next week, I am resolute for getting out of the dust and reck of this City for a week or two. To get out of it, whither could I go so willingly as home to my Mother? I still hope, it may be so, nay almost believe so: but you will see, Jack&#x2019;s new plans have deranged both himself and us all.</p>
<p>Another <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> thing I must mention: that there is a sum of One hundred and forty-five pounds lying for your lifting at the Commercial Bank in Dumfries, on or after Wednesday first; arranged in the old way (payable to Mrs Margaret on the part of Mr Thomas Carlyle), and to be treated in the old way; namely to have a receipt taken for it in the name of Dr Carlyle, the interest payable to the said Mrs Margaret,&#x2014;all as you did formerly, more than once. I settled that today; I think you may get this Letter about Monday or earlier; you will then perhaps be able to get to Dumfries on the Wednesday; but any day will do: if none of you can write, James Aitken may put &#x201C;right&#x201D; on the Newspaper (as he did formerly), and it will put me off for a while.&#x2014; And now this is all the <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> good news I have this time: I must come to the <hi rend="italic">uncertain</hi>, and let you see at least what an uncertainty it is.</p>
<p>The last time I wrote any word was to Jean at Dumfries, and it then seemed pretty sure that Jack was to be here on the <date when="1835-09-01">first of September</date>, and directly thereafter he and I were to be in Annandale. Well, so it stood, when above a fortnight ago, this new Letter of Jack&#x2019;s came to hand; which you will hardly be able to read: for it is literally a <hi rend="italic">double</hi> Letter, and one end of it totally contradicts the other! It happened to arrive on the very day it speaks of as the day of Jack&#x2019;s own arrival; and was read with the thought that perhaps the poor Doctor himself would in a moment knock at the door! Alas! We turn up the sheet and the whole matter alters; the Doctor first parts in a kind of huff with her Ladyship; then goes back on that, makes a new engagement (apparently short in duration and not clear in tenor), arranges and disarranges; and ends by inviting <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to come and see <hi rend="italic">him</hi> at Munich! Both Jane and I were inclined to be nettled that he had not <hi rend="italic">left</hi> that cold, starched, seemingly quite heartless Ladyship of hers to go her gate; and come, for his share, <hi rend="italic">home</hi> when his time was done. <hi rend="italic">She</hi>, I think, will never disturb herself (in this world or the <pb id="pg-08-201" n="08:201"/>next) to do a kindness or service to anybody. However, Jack ordered it otherwise, and perhaps it is better: it is good at least not to part with any person, if one can help it, in a <hi rend="italic">pet.</hi>&#x2014; But the grand question is now: What shall we <hi rend="italic">do?</hi> Poor Jack seems very anxious to see me, and advise with me: I was obliged to decline going to Munich, as too far, and as an enterprise that would cost too much both of money and time; but I proposed, if he were still at liberty, that we might meet in Paris,&#x2014;which lies as a sort of half-way house between us at present, not farther from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> than Scotsbrig is, and not above twice that distance from him at Geneva. I said, we might spend ten days together there; that I could <hi rend="italic">see</hi> many things there, which might be useful in my French Revolution Book, &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s letter to John in which he made these proposals has not been found.</note> There might have been an answer back from him by this time, and I thought I would not write to you till I had heard: however, no answer has yet come, and as the money was waiting, and I guessed your impatience, it seemed better to write at any rate.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s reply is dated <date when="1835-09-05">5 Sept.</date></note> It has never seemed to me likely that the Paris Journey would take effect; in which case I am pretty clear for Annandale, and you may see me in not many days! But we will fix nothing; and even not confidently hope anything, after so many disappointments. I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> very anxious to see you all; and even feel that it will do myself a real benefit. I have Two long volumes (all but a Chapter) if this sorry task were done; and shall get much better on after a rest. So soon as Jack&#x2019;s Letter comes, it will be settled; and I will write and say.</p>
<p>As to Jack&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">new</hi> engagement, it seems of the vaguest kind, dependent on Cholera in Italy, and other contingencies; neither does it seem likely to last above a month or two at longest. He has had some speculation about settling in Rome to practice for his own behoof; but I hardly think that will come to anything. He will probably, I think, attend the Lady to Munich, or till she meet her Brother; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, one would really incline to say, he ought to shake hands with her, and follow his own course,&#x2014;towards some kind of permanent work. We shall see how it all turns; and trust that the uncertainty may settle into some certainly that shall prove for the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> to all of us.&#x2014; I pity you with that Letter of Jack&#x2019;s; but if you cannot make it out, do not mind much: you have got the purport of it here.</p>
<p>I have whole bundles of things to tell you; but must not so much as begin at present. We have had the wretchedest summer in regard <pb id="pg-08-202" n="08:202"/>to hot dry weather that I have seen since <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>; and then <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was in the Brick Wilderness! It was really very uncomfortable and unwholesome. The blistering drought and fire stewing up from great leagues of pavement! All grass has been <hi rend="italic">brown</hi> for many weeks; the soil of the Parks rent into great <hi rend="italic">cracks;</hi> the garden-soil dry as snuff, down almost as far as the spade would go. However, we have got a little rain now; and have <hi rend="italic">that</hi> all behind us. My health did not suffer so much as many a one&#x2019;s: I did not overwork myself; I really am quite tolerably well. I even feel very considerably happier than I used to do: I care for one thing only, the getting done with this weary Book; I wish to be done with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, and let the rest all shape itself exactly as it likes. The longer I live here, the more sure I feel of my ground; the world may wag this way or that way; I, by God&#x2019;s grace, will hold on, whither my load<hi rend="italic">stars</hi> direct me. It is the very madness of Bedlam, much of the work that goes on here; I provoke not myself with it: I also find very great friendship from several very excellent people: I have great reason to rejoice that we ventured hither.&#x2014; But dear Mother, do I not hope to <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> you all this, so soon?</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh came on Monday gone a week:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1835-08-31">31 Aug.</date></note> I found her far away to the East in an Edinburgh Steamboat, and brought her up the River (5 or 6 miles) triumphantly home in a Boat. She sends you her kindest regards; bids me say, she is neither swallowed with whales nor otherwise injured, but well and mindful of you.&#x2014; Poor Jane, all the time of the hot weather, had been getting more and more bilious and weak: when her Mother came, she seemed to <hi rend="italic">surrender</hi>, and had a very miserable fit of sick headache next day, and was and is still very <foreign>feckless</foreign>, tho&#x2019; I do think better: Mrs Sterling (a most worthy Irishwoman) has taken her out this day (Wednesday) some twenty miles into the country on a visit to her (Mrs S&#x2019;s) Mother; not to return till Saturday: I think it likely to do her a great deal of good. Mrs Welsh and I, meanwhile, are left alone, to keep house ourselves, and do very well. She has told me much about your and Jenny&#x2019;s visit, naturally among the most interesting of all topics to me.&#x2014; I will not finish till tomorrow, after work. Good night, dear Mother! <closer><salute>May Good be near you now &#x26; always!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have done a little piece of work, and send you Good-day before I close this, and go out. Mrs Welsh is writing a small Note to Mary at Templand; which you can get sent up by Andrew Watson.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carrier; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281230-JWC-TC-01"><sic>4:438</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1828-12-30">30 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> There is no Letter yet from Jack; but I hardly expect that many days will pass, till one come.</p>
<p>Tell Alick that there is no man or creature I am more desirous to hear about than him. I would have written; but could not, this time.&#x2014; My kind brotherly wishes to him, and them all. Jock Thomson (and Macqueen)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jock Thomson from Annan and John Macqueen from Craigenputtoch, on their apparently annual visit to Barnet Fair (cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340921-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:309</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-09-21">21 Sept. 1834</date></corr></ref>).</note> came here the other day; said he had <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> both Alick and Jemmy; but could say little or nothing more.&#x2014; You may tell Jean (for I do not think James plays such tricks) that, one week, there came no Cou<supplied>[rier]</supplied> I suppose, by insufficient wafering! That piece of wood for shoe-lasts must be dry now and I will use it!&#x2014; Mary, I think, sent me a Manchester Newspaper? We could not very certainly specify the hand, but thought it hers. Mrs Welsh had Jenny&#x2019;s last Letterkin in her bags and showed it me.</p>
<p>O my dear Mother, how many thousand questions I should wish to ask you, and have no space for one! We will hope there is a time coming.&#x2014; Why do you not write? Surely your right hand has forgotten its cunning.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 137:5.</note> There is new rain today in deep showers, which I hear with singular joy. Wet weather never so wet is nothing in the world to excessive drought.&#x2014; Alas, alas, <foreign>bairn</foreign>! I am quite done; my time and my paper.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself, my dear good Mother; and be well when I see you! This weary Manuscript will and must be done. Did I tell you of a new American Letter; which would put even you to the blush.

<p><salute>My dear Mrs. Welsh,&#x2014;</salute> Could I have hoped to give you any comfort by writing, I would not have delayed an instant after receiving your sister&#x2019;s letter: but I know by experience, that in heavy afflictions like that you are suffering; all that friends can say in the shape of comfort is of no earthly use, &#x2018;the heart knoweth its own bitterness, and the stranger intermeddleth not therewith.&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 14:10.</note> Time, and new sources of interest and occupation, and the consciousness, above all, of having fitly done your part in the relation with my poor Uncle,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Welsh of Boreland, Galloway, who had died on <date when="1835-09-02">2 Sept.</date></note> will, I trust, restore your spirits; and in the meantime I feel it would be impertinent rather than kind to assail you with commonplaces of consolation.</p>
<p>For myself, the news of my Uncle&#x2019;s actual death hardly seemed <pb id="pg-08-205" n="08:205"/>to make him more lost to me than I have felt him to be ever since I left Scotland. He told me when we parted in Dumfries that he could not live to see me again; and I felt too certain at the moment that he was not deceiving himself: all I had heard of him, since, had made me rather wish for his release than given me the least hope of his restoration. My family is rapidly melting away from the face of this earth and the few of us who remain may look to follow the rest at no great distance. But a young generation is growing up to fill the gap. May they be healthier and every way better off than those who have gone before them!</p>
<p>Kiss your children<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>) and George (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>).</note> for me; and believe, it will always give me a true gratification to hear of your and their well-being.</p>
<p>My Mother who is with me at present bids me offer you her sincere sympathy and kind regards. She received Miss Kissock&#x2019;s letter and would have written herself, if she had not had an opportunity of acknowledging it thro&#x2019; me.</p>
<p>I had hoped to be in Scotland before this but we have been delayed by my Brotherinlaw&#x2019;s prolonged stay abroad till it is now too late in the season for me to undertake so laborious a journey. My Husband however still means to go down for a week or two shortly.</p>
<p>We find our present residence much more suitable than Craigenputtock was; nor do I think it more unhealthy: of late weeks indeed I have been a grievous invalid, but in general since I came to reside in London I have been much stronger than I used to be on that dismal hillside.</p>
<p>Remember me very kindly to your sister. My Husband unites with me in all good wishes for yourself and your children.</p>

<salute>My dear Friend</salute>
<p>I have been hindered from writing to you all this while by the same cause, which has hindered me from doing almost every thing on earth that I ought to have done these last six weeks. Continual illness, namely, one day taking the form of intolerable headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>, another <pb id="pg-08-206" n="08:206"/>day of equally intolerable colic, and many days together animating me with a noble disposition to hang or drown myself. Since you left me, especially; I have been at the right pitch of suffering for entitleing [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] me to Mrs Jeffreys warmest sympathy; confined to bed and not <supplied>[out]</supplied> of danger of &#x201C;going to the Undertaker&#x201D; [the Co<supplied>[c]</supplied>kney idea of a future state].<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The brackets are Jane&#x2019;s.</note></p>
<p>My projected visit to Herstmonceaux did not take effect.&#x2014; My Mother arriving<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Came <date when="1835-08-31">Aug. 31</date>. Herstmonceux, where John Sterling still was, had been the kind project of his mother for behoof of my poor suffering Jeannie&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> on the very day we should have set out&#x2014; It seemed when I had received her in a perpendicular posture, and seen her fairly established in the house that I had nothing more to do; for I made no more fight with destiny but quietly took to bed.</p>
<p>When I was a little recovered M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Sterling who would not give up the fancy for taking me out of town carried me to her Brothers for a few days&#x2014;about 25 miles from London<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Near Watford (Mr Cunningham, who tragically died soon after)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;a perfect Paradise of a place, peopled as every Paradise ought to be with Angels. There I drank warm milk, and eat new eggs, and bathed in pure air, and rejoiced in cheerful countenances, and was as happy as the day was long, which I should have been a monster not to have been, when every body about me seemed to have no other object in life but to study my pleasure. I returned in high feather&#x2014;to be sick again the very next day!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now I am but just arisen from another horrible attack which being the wor<supplied>[s]</supplied>t, I fondly flatter myself may prove the finale to the business for this time.</p>
<p>I long very much to see you again, and have too much confidence in your kindness of nature to dread that my inability to make your last visit agreeable or even decently comfortable will deter you from giving me again the pleasure which I always have in your company; sick or well.</p>

<p>Your [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] are doubtless longing, <salute>My dear Brother,</salute> to have another Letter from me; and will open this at Munich, I hope, safe and sound, with considerable impatience. I have not delayed wilfully; but only till I could send you decisive news. This is literally the first day, in which I could have specified my future whereabout in Time and Space, for the nearest Future, with any kind of completeness.</p>
<p>Tho&#x2019; you are a sharp-tempered man, Jack, like the rest of us; yet I know you certainly for the placablest of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> men: so I doubt not whatsoever of natural wrath you felt went fairly up the chimney with that sacrificed Letter, and there was again peace between us, nay better peace than before. Well when a small holocaust of that kind will do the business!&#x2014; I did not write in irritation against Her Ladyship or indeed anybody so far as I remember; but expressed in such words as came readiest the deliberate permanent opinion I had been led to form of her from such imperfect data as I had. If my reading was wrong, I recant it not only willingly but joyfully. To you at any rate such defence of your rather skittish and peculiar co-partner in this wayward business is very creditable: continue forever to take the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> view of all mortals which your understanding will admit; nay it is often also <hi rend="italic">truer</hi> than the surly one. But, for myself, all buckram grows more and more a kind of weariness to me: there perhaps has not been these two thousand years or thereby any mortal to whom man stood more completely as an <hi rend="italic">unclothed animal</hi> than he (unluckily and luckily) does to me. It makes a strange world of it for one; and gives and will give one work enough: for often the buckram <hi rend="italic">crackles</hi> amazingly when you treat it like mere cloth.&#x2014; However (<hi rend="italic">&#x201C;&#x2019;o.v.a&#x201D;</hi>),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie pronunciation of &#x201C;however.&#x201D;</note> let me tell you my history.</p>
<p>First then, by the real blessing and favour of Heaven, I <hi rend="italic">got done</hi> with that unutterable Manuscript, on Monday last;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote in the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> for <date when="1835-09-23">23 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;On Monday last, about four o&#x2019;clock, in a wet day, I <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> that unutterable burnt Manuscript! &#x2026; The Thing itself is <hi rend="italic">no</hi>thing; nevertheless the getting done with it was all in all. I seem to myself like a man that had nearly worn the Life out of him, accomplishing&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">zero</hi>. I could do no other or better. &#x2026; Courage; hat firmly set on head, foot firmly planted! &#x2018;Fear nothing but fear.&#x2019;&#x2014; I fancy I shall go in an Edinburgh Smack; not the worst way, and the <hi rend="italic">cheapest</hi>, tho&#x2019; slowest. <hi rend="italic">One</hi> sails on Sunday. Today write to Jack (he wanted me to come to Munich; I cannot come); to my Mother: tomorrow calls, dine with Fraser (unwillingly), &#x26;c &#x26;c.&#x2014;we have been very sickly; troubled with servants (I turned one off, last night) and so <hi rend="italic">forth</hi>. Mrs. Welsh here: I found her at the St Katherine Dock, three weeks ago; came up the River with her: she stays till I return.&#x201D;</note> and have wrapped <pb id="pg-08-209" n="08:209"/>it up, there to lie, &#x201C;for a monument o&#x2019; hees [his] injustice,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained coterie speech.</note> or other purposes, till the other two volumes be complete. The work does not seem to myself to be <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much worse than it was; it is worse in the style of expression, but better compacted in the thought: as it goes thro&#x2019; the Press I may help it somewhat. On the whole I feel like a man that had &#x201C;nearly killed himself accomplishing <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. n. 2.</note> But <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> or not <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>, what a deliverance! I shall never without a kind of sacred shudder look back at the detestable state of enchantment I have worked in for these six months, and am now blessedly delivered from. The rest of the Book shall go on quite like child&#x2019;s play in comparison: also I do think it will be a <hi rend="italic">queer</hi> Book; one of the <hi rend="italic">queerest</hi> published in this Century, and <hi rend="italic">can</hi>, tho it cannot be popular, be better than that. My Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh humour, no <hi rend="italic">voluntary</hi> one, of looking &#x201C;thro&#x2019; the clothes&#x201D; finds singular scope in this subject. Remarkable also is the &#x201C;still death-defiance&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 167.</note> I have settled into; equivalent to the most absolute sovereignty conceivable by the mind. I say &#x201C;still death-defiance&#x201D;; yet it is not unblended with a Greek-fire of Hope, <hi rend="italic">un</hi>quenchable, which glows up silent, steady, brighter and brighter. My one thought is to be done with this Book. Innumerable things point all that way: my whole destiny seems as if it lost itself in chaos there (for my Money also gets done then, &#x26;c &#x26;c) <hi rend="italic">in chaos, which I am to re-create</hi>, or to perish miserably,&#x2014;an arrangement which I really regard as blessed comparatively. So I sit here and write, composed in mood; responsible to no man or to no thing; only to God and my own conscience: with publishers, reviewers, hawkers, bill-stickers, indeed, on the Earth round me; but with the stars and the azure Eternity above me in the Heaven. Let us be thankful!&#x2014; On the whole, I am rather stupid; or rather I am not stupid (for I feel a fierce glare of insight in me into many things); not stupid,&#x2014;but I have <hi rend="italic">no sleight of hand</hi>. A raw untrained savage; for every trained civilized man <hi rend="italic">has</hi> that sleight, and is a bred workman by having it: the bricklayer with his trowel, the painter with his brush, the writer with his pen. The result <pb id="pg-08-210" n="08:210"/>of the whole is: &#x201C;one must just do the best he can for a living, Boy.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270510-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:223</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-05-10">10 May 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> Or in my Mother&#x2019;s phrase, <supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied>never <foreign>tine</foreign> heart,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340722-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:245</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-07-22">22 July 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;or even <hi rend="italic">get</hi> provoked heart, which likewise is a danger.</p>
<p>But am I coming to Munich? Dear Jack, I have meditated considerably on that; and have figured out all your brotherly love and sorrow; but after all I find, things being accurately weighed, my spirits, our cash, it is <hi rend="italic">better</hi> for me and a kind of duty, to go to Scotland rather. Our poor Mother has had a most disappointed summer; I promised to go and see her yearly while I could: God knows whether it may be <hi rend="italic">long</hi> possible: I feel that I must to Scotland, and leave you far away. Besides I say to myself, if you are coming home in <date when="1835-11-00">November</date> (in a month!), what good were it? On the other hand, if by any unforeseen chance, poor Jack should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get home as he expects, I hereby engage that after this Book is done, I will cheerfully set out to see him, towards any point of Europe! I give you that promise; and mean, if needful which I hope it will not be, to keep it to the Letter. The Book <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be done in <date when="1836-03-00">March</date>: alas, it is not likely <hi rend="italic">so;</hi> but we will hope and try.</p>
<p>My arrangement then is this. I went yesterday into the City to inquire for Scotch Conveyances; I found there were smacks to Leith every Thursday and Sunday, a Steamboat to Newcastle every Tuesday: I have as good as resolved in favour of the next Sunday smack; it is cheapest (the whole charge only &#xa3;2); the accomodation <hi rend="italic">best</hi>, as all agree and my own experience agrees; the sea-air promised blessed freshness to me; I will smoke and sleep for the four or five days we sail;&#x2014;and finally there is the Mail to Dumfries that very night you arrive in Edinburgh. I write to my Mother announcing this, tonight or tomorrow. I feel as if I could fling my trunks on board, and then fling down myself, and <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>. I will have a dip in the Solway yet; <hi rend="italic">see</hi> what they are all doing; and return a new-made man to my winter&#x2019;s work before <date when="1835-11-00">November</date> set in. To give you a better notion of it, you are to understand that Mrs Welsh is here: so that Jane, whom it otherwise would not suit to travel at this season, can still have the best company in my absence. Mrs Welsh has been here some three weeks, and spoke of returning in <date when="1835-11-00">November</date>. She does not take very much to London or its ways; but seems happy enough to be beside her child again. She has told me much about my Mother and Jenny. whom she had up at Templand before her departure: they were the <pb id="pg-08-211" n="08:211"/>happiest party; jaunting, cuddy-carts, Mrs Glendinning,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320821-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:205</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1832-08-21">21 Aug. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x26;c, &#x26;c.&#x2014; Poor Jane has been very unwell; especially ever since her Mother came, when she seemed as it were to give way; and broke down into the most violent series of headaches (with colic too) she has had for long. The hot weather had withered us all up: I never lived-thro&#x2019; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">erlebte</hi></foreign> [experienced]) such a two-months for weather; the stew and smoulder was as the breath of kiln-drying, choking and palsying<supplied>[:]</supplied> one felt as a certain Irishman told us he did at Munich, one summer, &#x201C;as if the spine were all gone; as if one were a serpent trying to <hi rend="italic">stand on its tail</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, later often used by Jane. The Irishman was George Darley: see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June</date></ref>.</note> That is happily all over now, and we have even wet weather (still most grateful, by contrast); the Parks are springing up again like leek-beds: the little Dame will do well enough now. Especially, she says, as the Manuscript is over too! We have moreover had trouble on trouble with servants: two Irishwomen in succession, each half-distracted, tho&#x2019; in different styles of distraction, filled up the series; the latter of whom, jingling down plates on the tea-table (for she had gone, an ugly woman too, with the face of a Polar Bear all week), and shattering the female and even the male nerves by it, had the luck to <hi rend="italic">explode</hi> me upon her (just last night) at the fatal instant, and in two instants more was packing up her duds for march,&#x2014;being desired &#x201C;in God&#x2019;s name and even in the Devil&#x2019;s name&#x201D; either to do that, or conduct herself like a rational creature, and preferring the former alternative. She is gone, I lit the fire myself this morning, our two Mistresses became their own housemaid; and we have perfectly a Heaven-on-Earth since. <foreign>Shifty</foreign> Jane has already found a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> g<supplied>[irl]</supplied> of suitable promise, who will come at four o&#x2019;clock; and I am to try my whole industry, and bri<supplied>[ng some]</supplied> kind of damsel from Scotland with me. Nothing was ever more miserable than the arrangement of <supplied>[tha]</supplied>t universal relation, Master and Servant, here at this time. <hi rend="italic">Society</hi>, of all kinds, in fact seems rapidly rushing towards unknown changes and consummations. We, meanwhile, have got a quiet house; and I have declared, what I deliberately feel, that I will rather get some small apartment, and sweep it out and arrange it for myself with my own hands (as my brave Uncle Tom<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carlyle (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>), Thomas&#x2019;s paternal uncle.</note> did) than be bedevilled with <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a set of unfortunates any more.&#x2014;&#x2014; I have said nothing about our society &#x26;c; which, however, you fancy much as it was, only thinned somewhat by desertions to the country. The only new man I have <pb id="pg-08-212" n="08:212"/>seen is one Craik from Fife who &#x201C;desired my acquaintance,&#x201D; and has made it, thro&#x2019; Miss Hunter (one of the Jeffrey, Edinburgh, St Andrews people, a very resolute distinct kind of woman) whom Jane had brought over from Edmonton to spend a few days with us. Craik is a solid fellow; edits &#x201C;the Printing Machine,&#x201D; and otherwise bakes bricks for the Diffusion Society, with an honest oxlike strength and steadiness, not unworthy of praise. The honest ox is no Pegasus, but he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> honest, and shall have crib and provender.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Lillie Craik (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350920-JWC-SS-01">JWC to <sic>SH</sic><corr>SS</corr> [<date when="1835-09-20">20 Sept.</date>]</ref>). He may well have edited <hi rend="italic">The Printing Machine; or, Companion to the Library and Register of Progressive Knowledge</hi>, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>) before its merger with <hi rend="italic">Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s London Journal</hi> (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350600-TC-JHLH-01">TC to <sic>LH</sic><corr>JHLH</corr>, [ca. <date when="1835-06-00">early June</date>]</ref>), as the <hi rend="italic">Printing Machine</hi> was published by Charles Knight with whom Craik collaborated in the <hi rend="italic">Library of Entertaining Knowledge</hi>. In his editorial announcing the merger Hunt had said that &#x201C;a large and distinct portion&#x201D; of the work would be under the &#x201C;responsible management&#x201D; of the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Printing Machine</hi> with whom he had &#x201C;as perfect an agreement as can be expected from those who hold the right of thinking for themselves, with the most hearty toleration of the thoughts of others&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s London Journal</hi>, <date when="1835-05-27">27 May</date>). Hunt and Craik were friends.</note> Dunn the Clergyman sees us more and more, and loves us, himself loved: you will call him one of the best men you ever met with. They have all great fervour for me, and tolerance really wonderful. Lastly <foreign><hi rend="italic">il Comte</hi></foreign> <hi rend="italic">Pepoli</hi> comes hither every Wednesday night, with Italian for Jane; with <hi rend="italic">Babelic</hi> speculation, reading of Dante and so forth for me: a really superior sort of foreign product; vivacity, decision, grace even harmony (for I have read some of his verses); a very en<supplied>[ter]</supplied>taining man. We had a great burst of bravura together, over that class of Damned Souls in Dante, <foreign><hi rend="italic">infesti a Dio ed a i suin Nemici</hi></foreign> [harmful to God and to his Enemies], precisely &#x201C;the respectable people&#x201D; of this present generation of the world!

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>What a mournful piece of news is this you tell me! So sudden; final: a little week; and there is no return forevermore in Time! He was one of the best-conditioned men, the good William Johnstone,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had died at the Grange on <date when="1835-09-20">20 Sept.</date>; see also <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250826-TC-MRSWJ-01"><sic>3:372</sic><corr>TC to MRSWJ, <date when="1825-08-26">26 Aug. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> I have ever known. The loss to you will be great; and yet that is small to what the poor lady has to suffer. I hope she can make arrangements for leaving Grange thro&#x2019; winter? The gloom of these solitary hills will be all too gloomy for her. A hearth may blaze bright, where we have all sat; but the kind face it enlightened is not there, is hidden&#x2014;! O it is an unutterable business this life of Man; begirt with Death, with <pb id="pg-08-215" n="08:215"/>Judgment and Eternity. Ever, as from the beginning, &#x201C;Man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 12:5.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>You were perfectly correct to an iota in your theory about my silence.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Expressed in a letter which has not been found.</note> I had determined to deny myself all privilege of complaint to you till the evil was remedied. After the toughest battle, I got the wretched thing accomplished precisely on Monday last,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1835-09-21">21 Sept.</date></note> the day before you wrote to me. <hi rend="italic">It</hi> is worth little; but the being done with it is worth almost life to me. That was simply the ugliest task ever hitherto set me to do in the world.</p>
<p>Our Scotch summer jaunt has gone, like so much else, over to the Impossibles. No July day on Burnswark sheds its brightness over us; the smoke and smoulder of London Brick, hot and choking as one huge Brick-kiln, was allotted me instead.</p>
<p>However, I am bent for seeing Scotland after all. It has carried me on thro&#x2019; this business; and I will not balk myself. I write in breathless haste today; being just on the wing westward towards Wapping and that region, in search of a conveyance to Edinburgh or Newcastle. The sea seems less horrid to me than the New Patent Fast coach for twenty-six hours long;&#x2014;a thing that the Inquisition of Spain might have taken a hint from. To this moment I can predict with no certainty what way I shall come; but one thing seems certain, that, if accident befall not, I will come; that you shall see me in some eight or ten days. The people will be all busy with their untoward harvest, and the good weather gone; nevertheless one will get <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>, this frightful din will cease pealing in one&#x2019;s ears and soul for a week or two. I have a kind of passion to see green fields again; the jingle of a clear trotting Brook were worth all other music to me. It is as if you had been spun round for sixteen months with a preternatural velocity on some immeasurable whirligig (of a London City, with its million-and-half all scrambling together); and now begged of Heaven and of Earth one blessing: that of being &#x201C;well let alone.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, used many times by Jane in later letters.</note></p>
<p>Mrs. Welsh being with us these last three weeks or more, and to stay till I return, my wife does not go with me. She too has suffered much from the Summer; and is very poorly, but recovering. She brought me up your letter this morning, and said it contained &#x201C;sorrowful tidings.&#x201D; She sends her kind regards to Burnswark in general.</p>
<p>In some ten days then!&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear little Wifie,</salute>
<p>There has been a longer delay in writing this time than I anticipated; and now at last if I would not again disappoint thee, I must write without deliberation, with the smallest possible convenience: I expected to be back at Scotsbrig last night, and to write there (as indicated in the Newspaper) with all fit means and appliances; but the weather, as it usually does in these weeks, proved rainy; I staid with Alick, and must write here at his desk, or be too late for the post. You know what sort of thing writing here is! This Pen, for example, <hi rend="italic">marks;</hi> but if it do not mark there is no tool other than an old razor for mending it: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sic de caeteris</hi></foreign> [Thus for the rest]. However, I have a room to myself, a good fire and a locked door; kinder welcome <pb id="pg-08-217" n="08:217"/>never met man than that which meets unworthy me: so with or without much coherence, in the middle of the <foreign>squaelling</foreign> [screaming] of contented or discontented children, and the moist blustering of October winds, in view of the old steeple of Annan, with trees grass and <foreign><hi rend="italic">mugworths</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wormwood.</note> (that would delight Leigh Hunt) more immediately at hand, I dash you off some fractions of Autobiography as I can.</p>
<p>The journey to Liverpool I shall retain for long winter evenings. Garnier<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350527-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1835-05-27">27 May</date>]</ref>.</note> I fancy would call and say that he saw me safe in the Coach: you can fancy that I lumbered along, much-enduring, and got to port some time within the twenty-four hours. Literally <hi rend="italic">to port:</hi> for our so-called &#x201C;Liverpool Mail&#x201D; proved to be properly the &#x201C;Chester Mail,&#x201D; and took us some twenty miles of round about; landing us at last in the surly <foreign><hi rend="italic">gloaming</hi></foreign>(for the day had been wet) on the bare stones of the Dock; out of a Steamboat namely! There is no end to the deceptions of men and coach-keepers! However, the grand question was now, What to do? I was dusty, unslept, sulphurous; Maryland Street as I calculated would be just at dinner; we were far from it; far from the Carlisle Steamer, the times or seasons of which no man there could tell me of. With a Porter shouldering my luggage, I wandered to Steam-Offices; to a wrong Inn; finally to the right one (in Dale Street), learned that the Boat would verily sail at three in morning; got hot water and a bedroom; intent to brush myself there, and, spending the evening with Uncle,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh.</note> sail, asleep or awake, at the given hour. I was <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> exceedingly to open thy little red <foreign>poke</foreign> [bag] with shaving tools, and find it all so right and orderly; Mother and thou sitting probably at tea 200 miles from me. Bagmen surveyed me as I ate my beefsteak and drank my thimbleful of brandy; I set out forthwith for Rodney Street and Maryland Street. A long way; and a dim one, compared with the London ways. In a dingy street an elephantine figure stalked athwart me; I said, &#x201C;Dr Carson!&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carson: see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310811-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:317</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-11">11 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> it grunted affirmation; told me in a grunting somnolent tone what turns I had to Rodney Street; then lumbered on along its way without other salutation or goodnight. Heavy Bull of Bashan,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 22:12.</note> thought I, retire to thy crib, and proper sliced turnips with chaff await thee there!&#x2014; At last behold me in Maryland Street; the goodman welcoming me in his own open-hearted brotherly way, the good lady making me tea with toast and <pb id="pg-08-218" n="08:218"/>&#x201C;Irish honey,&#x201D; little Johnnie surveying Aunt Grizzie&#x2019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Welsh&#x2019;s.</note> present; all hands blithe to see me; all things attainable there; only not the one thing needful, rest. Tower-of-Babel Johnstone<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. George Johnston: see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200419-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:241</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1820-04-19">19 Aug. 1820</date></corr></ref>. Carlyle refers to him elsewhere as &#x201C;him of the Confusion of Tongues&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-07/lt-18340304-TC-JWE-01"><sic>7:113</sic><corr>TC to JWE, <date when="1834-03-04">4 March 1834</date></corr></ref>). Though unexplained it may refer to when John and Johnston were studying languages together: cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191111-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:206</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1819-11-11">11 Nov. 1819</date></corr></ref>. There has been no previous reference to his being married or having a daughter.</note> and his Daughter came directly, or were already there: Dr Arbuckle was soon sent for, and came. The good Doctor told me he was just leaving Liverpool and Europe: his romantic mysterious source of supply (which he now made no mystery of) had dried up; and invitation to Marinam (near Pernambuco, a Cotton-station in South America)<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Robert Arbuckle was probably going to S&#xe3;o Luiz de Maranh&#xe3;o, known in England as Maranham, the seaport capital of the north coast Brazilian state, Maranh&#xe3;o. Pernambuco was a seaport (now called Recife) and a state on the east coast of Brazil. It did not adjoin Maranh&#xe3;o and could not be described as near.</note> had been sent him, to practise among the English and Portuguese there; which invitation he had accepted; he was to sail in a week! I could not blame him; but that too was a <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> feature of the night. The young ladies sang and played; the old gentlemen and young drank red wine, ate shrimps and other supper, and all laughed as I talked: at length, after midnight, I arose and said to Arbuckle that he positively must then and there take charge of me, get me stuck in some lockfast place; or should he even tie a shot to my feet and fling me into the Mersey brine: for one way or the other <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> was grown utterly indespensable to me. You may fancy the friendly obtestations, outcries and preventives, all which I had resolutely and with brevity to wave aside. Arbuckle led me thro&#x2019; streets and confusions, I got bills settled, got porters, passed thro&#x2019; mountains of cotton-bags with sleepless watchmen on the top of them; on thro&#x2019; Dock police &#x26;c &#x26;c to the Carlisle Steamer; and there under the void night with a heartfelt invocation to God to bless him I took leave of the good Arbuckle,&#x2014;probably forever in this world. We were sad enough both; but so the Powers would have it. Sleep, after some jerkings and startings, rushed down on me; drowned all snorings &#x26;c &#x26;c; I awoke at my old hour of six; reeling in my drawer-bed, with the glad feeling that we were at sea, and must either get home soon or be drowned. I fasted; for we were all sick; the weather (for some hours) wet and gusty: finally after adventures and <foreign><hi rend="italic">misshanters</hi></foreign> [misadventures] (for I had fallen asleep, and they sailed <hi rend="italic">past</hi> Annan-foot with me, &#x26;c) I got safe to poor Mary&#x2019;s in the Suburbs of Annan at nine in the evening. It was Roodfair <pb id="pg-08-219" n="08:219"/>day;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Tues., <date when="1835-09-29">29 Sept.</date>, or Wed., <date when="1835-09-30">30 Sept.</date>, as the Roodfair lasted two days.</note> all were at Dumfries, and she was alone: the kindest of little women. In spite of rains next day, Alick and I got to Scotsbrig at the hour of sleep; they put me into a dry snug bed; I ailed nothing but headache and <hi rend="italic">sniftering</hi> [from a cold]; and, next morning, having &#x201C;indulged in a Cup of Castor&#x201D; I began rapidly to recover. I have done literally nothing since but go on with that; and so here I am, not at all entitled to complain much.</p>
<p>To tell you what they are all about would take long space. My Mother is well and cheerful beyond what I could have fancied. They have converted those two upper rooms into a really comfortable, quite brisk-looking Apartment, <hi rend="italic">far</hi> better than we ever saw them: Jenny is the most assiduous little handmaid and all goes along as smooth as oil.

Well; the <foreign>lass</foreign> is of slight nimble figure, with a rustic simplicity of intelligence and goodhumour in face; <hi rend="italic">can</hi> and will wash, sweep, scour, cook, and do <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things: I must carry her to London (she has a Brother there, a shop man): that will cost &#xa3;2<hi rend="superscript">..</hi>10; her wages must be &#xa3;5 the half-year without perquisites; if we or if she want to be off at the end of the first half year she returns <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the &#xa3;2<hi rend="superscript">..</hi>10: and goes her ways. I will inquire of Miss Little of Cressfield today; <pb id="pg-08-221" n="08:221"/>meet the girl again on Thursday, and hire her if it seem good. My own private notion is that she is no first-rate servant; more like M&#x2019;Turkdom than Chelsea; yet it is indubitable that Cressfield and others have wanted her back again: her goodness of character and temper (or rather I should say <hi rend="italic">nature</hi>, for there may be quickness of <hi rend="italic">temper</hi>, in that face) seems well proved: she wants no tea-money, beer-money, carpets &#x26;c &#x26;c; and the chance is that as compared with any we have had, she may be a very jewel. I endeavoured to make all plain to her; especially to an elder <foreign><hi rend="italic">gled</hi></foreign> [greedy buzzard] of a sister that had come with her: the creature looked innocently in my face, with a kind of trustfulness: for a year I do incline to suppose she may do. Shall I take her then? I see no other that I can do. She seems some 24 years of age; an attachable creature; may be handy, orderly (the probabilities are that way) is certainly submissive, lively and modest: better than most women. What can I do (let Miss Little testify or not) but take her, and be thankful? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nicht wahr</hi></foreign> [Don&#x2019;t you think so]?</p>
<p>This business of the <foreign>Lass</foreign> then being in a fair train, I must speak to you of <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>. Harry ran away, and flung off my Mother (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> blameably) he has performed other beautiful feats (they are really wise and laughable): my Mother will take him again from Alick, who has been feeding him on bought hay all this time: but the result of the whole is, he is not of use to any of them here. Now an ancient Blacksmith near this house, a man I remember of old,<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> has seen him, and fallen in love with him; a man &#x201C;extremely kind to horses&#x201D;: he will give the value for him, and keep him popping about in the easiest kind of employment in his old days; therefore I ask, were it not wise to sell him to the ancient Blacksmith? Say Yes, and it shall be done: say No, and I will try to do some other way. The result in money can be about some &#xa3;5: but perhaps there were no smoother old age to be provided for the poor beast, than even this same, which offers itself. Write: about this; and O about so many other things! <hi rend="italic">Without</hi> delay.</p>
<p>O Jeannie! My fingers are all as black as a crow (for our inkbottle is a <hi rend="italic">phial</hi>), and my head itself is not of the clearest, and I had so many hundred things to speak about; and to think about unspoken! Keep thy heart up, my brave <foreign>Lassie</foreign>: it <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be well!</p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>A newspaper is very pleasant when one is expecting nothing at all, but when it comes in place of a letter it is a positive insult to ones feelings. Accordingly your first newspaper was received by me in choicest mood, and the second would have been pitched in the fire had there been one at hand, when after having tumbled myself from the top story at the risk of my neck, I found myself deluded with &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wun penny im</hi>.&#x201D; However I flatter myself you would experience something of a similar disappointment on receiving mine, and so we are quits and I need not scold you&#x2014;</p>
<p>All is going as well with me, as I am thankful to find it is with you. I have not been a day in bed since you went<supplied>[,]</supplied> have indeed been almost quite free of headach<supplied>[e]</supplied> and all other aches, and every body says Mrs Carlyle begins to look better and what every body says must be true.

The poem is more likely to have been related to a four part poem Sterling told Julius Hare about in <date when="1835-11-00">Nov. 1835</date>. He wrote part 1 in <date when="1835-11-00">November</date>, about a youth told by his magician teacher that to &#x201C;give beauty of any kind an abiding reality, it must be sought and appropriated only under the consciousness and controll of duty and exclusive love.&#x201D; Part 2 was not yet written, part 3 was to consist of a partly reworked <hi rend="italic">Statues</hi> (probably written <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), and part 4 of a poem on the Bible which he told Hare could be found in his manuscripts. Jane may have heard an early draft of part 1 or, less probably, part 4. By <date when="1836-01-00">Jan. 1836</date>, Sterling had abandoned the plan and wrote to Hare &#x201C;the poem is, I think, deficient in interest, and too abstract in its ground and colouring for general readers:&#x201D; see Julius Charles Hare, ed., <hi rend="italic">Essays and Tales by John Sterling</hi> (London, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), I, lxxvi&#x2013;viii.</note> of half an hour length&#x2014;an Allegorical shadowing of the union of the Ideal and actual&#x2014; It is far the best thing he ever did&#x2014;far beyond any thing I could have supposed him capable of&#x2014; He said when he was writing it he thought sometimes &#x201C;Carlyle will be pleased with that&#x201D;<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>

<salute>My Dear Goody,</salute>
<p>It will perhaps most readily of all express the confusion I am in to say that writing even to thee I have this moment seen best to tear up one half-finished sheet and fling it in the fire! My head is all tumbled and my heart: deep, deep <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi> were of all earthly things the thing I should like most today. However, it is very clear to me what thy impatience must naturally be; the main matters too are all <hi rend="italic">settled</hi>; a letter conveying never so indistinctly even that fact must be welcome: I take a new sheet therefore; and will send <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, by Heaven&#x2019;s blessing, be as it may. O Goody!&#x2014; Understand, however, if the little vein of satiric humour have again come into play, that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is literally the first post, by which any letter could have come that was worth sending. There have been delays, errors, perversities: how erroneous are all men and things; oblique, oblique, not a right-angle accurately right anywhere; but ever the cursedest <hi rend="italic">bevel</hi> and discrepancy,&#x2014;to the <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> of time and effort, which should be <hi rend="italic">spent</hi> not wasted!</p>
<p>The estimable Marion Hay kept me trotting and inquiring, learning nothing much except that she &#x201C;could not be recommended as a Cook&#x201D;; in spite of which I was determined, and so was she: but alas, her Mother and friends &#x26;c &#x26;c, whereby ten good days were lost, and the outcome <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> after all! Then were journeyings to Dumfries; talking, talking* no fixed prospect; great cry and little wool.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A great Cry and little Wool quoth the Deel when he clip&#x2019;d the Swine&#x201D;: Kelly, <hi rend="italic">Scottish Proverbs</hi>, p. 47.</note> Mrs M&#x2019;Diarmid, on my first call, promised and languished; on my second call, had been able to do nothing, but &#x201C;speak to Mrs Wilson of the Commercial&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. William Wilson, Commercial Inn, Dumfries.</note> who again, when I waited on her, had been in like manner &#x201C;able to do nothing&#x201D;: the result was still good words <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> nothing. At Annan meanwhile by my own and Mary&#x2019;s industry I had got choice of two: the one a forward would-be beauty, and <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> artist in the servant line; full of Dock English (for she had been as far as Manchester), <pb id="pg-08-228" n="08:228"/>of self-possession, taproom ceremony; vulgarity exchanged for natural <hi rend="italic">un</hi>breeding: the other a young unfortunate (only twenty-one, yet with a walking &#x201C;Misfortune&#x201D;), whose account of herself was modesty itself; whose air and physiognomy seemed promising to me. On Saturday Night late, returning for the second time from Dumfries and good words <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> nothing, I hired this Misfortunate; and think, on the whole, she may do quite tolerably well; far better than the Dock-English; perhaps better than Hay herself would have done, who I found &#x201C;could not be recommended as a Cook,&#x201D; which was the name she gave herself; and also was occasionally unhealthy. Thou must take her, as thou gettest her, <foreign>Bairn</foreign>; for I could do no other better. A <foreign>shifty</foreign> healthy little <foreign>lass</foreign>; of small stature, but hardy and sharp; submissive, anxious to learn and do the best; rude native Annandale, who says <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;uz&#x201D;</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;me&#x201D;;</hi> if without manners, at least with no ill manners. She spoke of her &#x201C;misfortune&#x201D; without hysterics; but really in a candid natural way which pleased me more. Conceive her as almost <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">able</hi> to wash and dress, possessed of &#x201C;eminent&#x201D; skill in sewing and even shaping (having studied it), &#x201C;not a cook at all,&#x201D; except of her Father&#x2019;s and Mother&#x2019;s rustic victuals (which she does <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, as would seem); who has swept rooms, and the rest of it; who actually <hi rend="italic">keeps</hi> her Father&#x2019;s Cottage next door to Mary&#x2019;s, all clean as a pin: this I do believe is a fair total of her acquired talent. For the rest, my decided guess is that she will prove an orderly methodic creature; thrifty, honest (more than <hi rend="italic">hand</hi>-honest; there is no cant visible in the body), with the truest wish to do well. I judged &#x201C;by the physiognomy alone&#x201D;; it was her face passing Mary&#x2019;s window that first put the thought in me. Not a beautiful face; on the contrary a tawnyish, small coarse face; but the black eyes look out on you with a humble painstaking expression, of sincerity, industry, endurance: it was (bating the Misfortune) a better face for service, if a worse for friendship, than the estimable Hay&#x2019;s seemed to me: a stronger face, and a healthier quieter one. She comes <hi rend="italic">with me;</hi> on the same terms as Hay would have done; and I hope and believe thou wilt make her a kind of blessing to us. This matter, then, is settled, the best way I could: with unspeakable relief I wash my hands of it for year and day; the girl being likely to stay with us so long at least. She is of the size of Mary, more slenderly built, not <hi rend="italic">ugly</hi> at all to look upon: her name, tho&#x2019; she is &#x201C;no <hi rend="italic">Cook</hi> at all,&#x201D; is Anne Cook; and Mary will try her in porridge-making! Here I leave her till sight.</p>
<p>For the rest, the ancient Smith has taken possession of Harry, yesterday morning, at the charge of &#xa3;4<hi rend="superscript">..</hi>15 (the Crown-piece was <pb id="pg-08-229" n="08:229"/>luckpenny);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A small sum given back by the person who receives money in consequence of a bargain.

The like is to be said of meal: also a way for it to travel in; by Whitehaven, namely; the road to <hi rend="italic">which</hi> is a certain shop in Dumfries. Two <hi rend="italic">sock</hi>-boards are a-making; finally on Saturday my last transactions in Dumfries was having my foot for an hour in stucco [plaster of paris], and discoursing to the proper artificer on the nature of <hi rend="italic">lasts:</hi> there is to be a pair out here and a pair of shoes made on them in few days hence.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350409-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1835-04-09">9 April</date></ref>.</note> I studied sore to go up to Templand, were it only for an hour; but Mother and Alick were with me, their plans and engagements lying elsewhither: if your Mother would wish me for any purpose to go up, let her speak and I will still go. Our conveyance on that occasion was a light&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">cart</hi>, and one of Alick&#x2019;s trotting galloways. Harry&#x2019;s riding had grown intolerable, or next to that: travel of all sorts has hitherto suited me ill; or rather I should say the lodging and miscellaneous treatment I meet with on travel. Thus is the <hi rend="italic">business</hi> all settled; except my getting back to Chelsea; of which more anon. Rest is not for the wicked,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>I am to go tomorrow to Graham, who has been here, and saw me also at Annan. He <supplied>[is]</supplied> very friendly, but very wearisome; talks unceasingly about a &#x201C;Mr Menzies&#x201D; (pronouncing him <hi rend="italic">Menz</hi>ies, as he is spelt),<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Robert Menzies, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:365</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></corr></ref>.

I avoid gigmanism here as the pestilence; work-cartism is no less an offence to me: what I pray of men is to leave me alone in my glory&#x2014;till the liver get a little better. It is the strangest mood I live in amid these autumn leaves; all things are so full of golden interest, yet with an inexpressible sadness; my soul is <hi rend="italic">exceeding</hi> lonely; sparrowlike,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240927-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:159</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1824-09-27">27 Sept. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> companionless, worst of all when I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> &#x201C;company.&#x201D; Were a <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi> to revisit the glimpses of the moon,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, I, iv.</note> I fancy its humour would be such: but for a man&#x2014;!&#x2014;The only creature I have seen of the <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> sort that has given me the smallest pleasure was poor Aird<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Aird: see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:361</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350501-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1835-05-01">1 May</date></ref>.

Many loves he sent to you and Mother; also one Newspaper, which went off only today. M&#x2019;Diarmid paid me your &#xa3;10; and did nothing else of significance: indeed the second time he was not at home; I ate not, or drank not, or tarried in his house.

<salute>My Dear Inglis,</salute>
<p>No letter that can come from me in my present mood and position will be worth the reading, much less the paying for: nevertheless I had long ago determined to write to you when I should arrive here; and now something almost like a call of business (tho&#x2019;, alas, on my part only begging business) impels me to do it. In the dullest of all humours, soliciting from the Heavens and the Earth no higher blessedness than to be let alone, I accordingly stir myself up, as it were in spite of the Devil and the Flesh. The probability or even the certainty is, I shall profit by it myself: if you suffer, pray bear it like a Martyr, as you and all men are or ought to be.</p>
<p>Your Letter, your two Letters found us duly at Chelsea; I can still remember the days of their arrival, as a kind of white days. We like always truly <hi rend="italic">well</hi> to hear of you, especially from you. There is the image of a brave man, dashing bravely to the right and left of him many a sorry obstacle; &#x201C;in still defiance,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340517-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:157</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-17">17 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> or with brisk good humour, and genial mockery of what is not worth being angry at, &#x201C;stepping stoutly along.&#x201D; Forward, forward, in that brave fashion, and ever the more bravely! Another great merit is your evident enduring good-will towards <hi rend="italic">oneself:</hi> thanks many for it; long may it live in your heart, long find a lively counterpart in mine! One cannot <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> of such things without desecrating them: but surely if there be in this beggarly world anything worth prizing, one knows ever the longer the better <hi rend="italic">what</hi> that is.</p>
<p>I have fled hither some three weeks ago out of Din and Confusion grown insupportable; to rest me a little here; to look once again, were it only with the feeling of a <foreign><hi rend="italic">r&#xE9;venant</hi></foreign> (all too ghostlike verily) on the scenes one inhabited when alive. In that Brick Babel, where all goes with such breakneck speed, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> from the Cab-driving on the streets to the way of thinking, of existing within doors and within hearts, you grow after a certain length of time to feel as one whirled <pb id="pg-08-234" n="08:234"/>with inconceivable velocity on an immeasurable whirligig for what purpose you cannot so well see; whereby you, in a fit of desperation (as some I have known <hi rend="italic">do</hi>) at length go and fling yourself into the River; or else, which is the milder and surely preferable method,&#x2014;retire for five weeks into the country; as I have done now. My Wife has her Mother with her; and with more or less patience waits my return. Did you notice on a Newspaper that I hoped &#x201C;to see you soon&#x201D;? The truth is, I did calculate on going by sea and Edinburgh, to wait, with you mainly, there one night: but Smacks and Steamboats proved all ineligible; so I fled by Liverpool rather. Literally a flight; for no sleep rested on my eyes; and I felt as if retreating from the <foreign><hi rend="italic">H&#xF6;llische Jagd</hi></foreign> [devilish hunt], as properly it was. In another fortnight I must be back.</p>
<p>I have been exceedingly busied and bustled in that Babel: apparently to little end. A task I had set myself of writing on the &#x201C;French Revolution&#x201D; would not prosper much, met the sorrowfullest mischances, and is yet far from done. A first volume, the fruit of five months hard toil, was lent to a friend, and by him, too carelessly, <hi rend="italic">sent up the chimney</hi>, as kindling for fires! This is literally <hi rend="italic">true</hi>. The task of <hi rend="italic">re</hi>-writing it lasted six months; and was the ugliest I ever had in life, or expect ever to have. It is done, however; and if the Heavens keep me alive six months longer, the rest of the Book shall be done; after which my outlook into the future, as it were <hi rend="italic">terminates</hi>. Literature in London is madder than Bedlam: nevertheless true it remains that God made this Universe and not the Devil; wherefore a man ought to possess his soul in peace, if he means peacefully; and hold himself ready for turning to the right hand if his way on the left hand prove all too foul. Pray only that I may be able by and by to send you a copy of the Book! Who knows but it may prove almost a <hi rend="italic">unique</hi> in Edinburgh. It seemed more and more as if there were no one but yourself with whom I had any sympathy there, any call for sympathy. One should love his brothers; but finds it easier at some seasons to do it in the <hi rend="italic">cryptophilous</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is coining the word, which he defines in the phrase which follows it.</note> way, giving or receiving no sign. In London there is much to <hi rend="italic">over</hi>look (if you would keep your temper), but also somewhat to <hi rend="italic">look</hi> at and dwell on: in regard to companionship and social position among my fellow men I was never elsewhere so well situated, indeed never elsewhere <hi rend="italic">situated</hi> at all. We must take the evil with the good.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-235" n="08:235"/>But amid these generalities, let me not forget the speciality, &#x201C;call almost of business,&#x201D; which brings you in contact with them today. The question is, Do you fortunately wa<supplied>[nt a]</supplied> Law-Clerk? Do you know any reputable Law-practitioner that does? There is a young Cousin of mine, of my own name,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carlyle, son of Carlyle&#x2019;s Uncle Frank. See A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NL</hi>, II, 211&#x2013;12, where in a letter of <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date> Carlyle writes: &#x201C;I could do nothing for Tom in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, tho&#x2019; I did try this and that; and he owes me absolutely nothing. Nor can I now do anything for him; nobody can,&#x2014;except himself, by being wiser than he was.&#x201D; Carlyle probably wrote <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> in mistake for <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>.</note> who longs greatly for such a situation; who, I imagine, might really fill it well. He was in an &#x201C;Office&#x201D; in these parts, but the Attorney died; and Tom is now in the Sheriff&#x2019;s Establishment at Dumfries, working without wages, for improvement merely. Improvement he does want (being still only nineteen or twenty), but also some frugal means of living. A place in some Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lawyer&#x2019;s Office, if not a W. S.,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Writer to the Signet.</note> then some inferior kind of man,&#x2014;would meet all his wishes for a year or two. He is actually a modest, intelligent, very well-conditioned youth this Cousin of mine; of industrious, methodic habits; clear, even penetrating, for his years; likely one might say to make a superior kind of clerk; and, if he live, a superior kind of man. For the rest, owing to circumstances it seems to me as if a more than usual charge of him were laid in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands: father and mother are gone; he is, apart from his qualities, one of the loneliest young creatures now living.&#x2014; Alas, I fear you can do nothing in this kind for him: yet it seems my duty to <hi rend="italic">try;</hi> if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi>, nothing is surer for me than that you will with true readiness. I remain here till the beginning of <date when="1835-11-00">November</date> (first <hi rend="italic">week</hi> probably); after that the address is the old one, which you know.</p>
<p>As it is dubious whether you can even make out the handwriting of this, I will not soil more of the white paper with such work; but let you go. May good be with you and not evil, my Friend! Forget me not while we both pilgrim on this side the Moon. It is a solitary kind of world; yet it is a world; and, I imagine, had a Maker;&#x2014;as the other also, and all others, will probably be found to have. <closer><salute>Farewell and love me!</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>My Wife would send you a hundred compliments if she were here; that is really a modest computation of it. I fear Mrs Inglis<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inglis&#x2019; first wife. m. <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, was Mary Ann Stein of Wester Greenyards.</note> has forgotten <pb id="pg-08-236" n="08:236"/>me; but pray try to put her favourably in mind.&#x2014; Will you ever come to London?

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>On Sabbath last, when our Mother, Alick and I returned from Annan, and properly also from Dumfries, where we had been on an expedition of three days, we found Jenny in possession of your Munich Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1835-10-06">6 Oct.</date> John says in the letter that they had arrived at Munich from Geneva late the previous evening.</note> which she had got the night before. I assembled the whole household round me on the spot, and read your news; greatly to the solacement of all. That you are well, and safe in what seems likely to prove your winter quarters, is one of the cheerful sides of our position at present. Notwithstanding your strict charges I have been forced to lose one post; and even now shall not be able to write with the composure or perspicuity I could have wished: I write as it were by the wayside; in the large room up stairs, which has now a pretty constant thoroughfare thro&#x2019; it towards the inner or cooking and main room; neither is my own mood, in this gusty October weather, with the whew [whistle] of moist winds scattering <foreign><hi rend="italic">decidua</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either the obvious wordplay or a medical joke, suitable for Dr. John Carlyle?</note> all round us, one of the briskest: however, I will do what is in me; you shall know at least that we are all in health and heartily well disposed towards you: with this itself, carried to such a distance as Munich; you would feel as one that had got something considerable.</p>
<p>It is three weeks and two days now since I arrived here; after the usual unpleasant tumbling of a journey by land and sea: unpleasant always; to me in my actual mood highly so. However, my actual damage by it was only a slight sniftering of cold, which went off in a day or two: after two days of rolling and hurrying I found myself transferred from No. 5 Cheyne Row to Mary&#x2019;s little habitation in Wellington street, Annan; little, but full of hospitality; and next night <pb id="pg-08-237" n="08:237"/>Alick and I roused the Scotsbrig people from their premature dormitories, and we were welcomed by a Mother. How glad she was to see me I need not say; it will be more pertinent to assure you that she looked wonderfully well; has really a snug lodging up stairs here, and with the neat-handed Jenny beside her, gets along, so far as I can judge, really in a comfortable handsome way. The front-room is new painted by James Aitken, the walls ornamented by some Italian &#x201C;pictures,&#x201D; that you wot of, all in goodly frames, among which my sulky figure<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Maclise&#x2019;s portrait of Carlyle for <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s;</hi> see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320216-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:125</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-02-16">16 Feb. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> also hangs (right opposite the window between the <foreign><hi rend="italic">uomo di ritorno</hi></foreign> [man of return] and the <hi rend="italic">Donna di Caraffin;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a member of the famous Neapolitan family, Carafa or Caraffa, that flourished from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century; John had brought the pictures from Italy, and James Aitken had framed them, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331118-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:37</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-11-18">18 Nov. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> the &#x201C;eminent Reformer&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly John Knox; cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230308-JBW-EA-01"><sic>2:305</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1823-03-08">8 March 1823</date></corr></ref> where Alexander Donaldson calls him &#x201C;the great reformer.&#x201D;</note> looking towards the Book-case, with the end-wall wholly to himself); not to speak of tables with covers, with japanned work boxes &#x26;c; and all kept clean as a pin. The big bed, where I sleep, with curtains new-dyed red, looking very smart, occupies the corner opposite the fire; the side parallel to (and almost in contact with) the staircase wall; old Bookcase and chest of drawers at its feet. I assure you it is all very tidy and sufficient looking. Then the other inner room, which is the room of use, this being the room of state or ceremony,&#x2014;I assure you, you would be surprised to see what an improvement is wrought on it by the breaking out of the front window (a window of old, but walled up), by the papering of bed, by sorting and siding, judiciously applied. It is quite <hi rend="italic">light</hi> now; free of smoke; warm and dry. The bed (papered inside) stands fronting the fire, room for breakfast or dinner to be held in front of it; the head end is towards the new window, yet quite out of its light: the space between the wall and that head-end is full of pegs and hooks with a shelf or two, where the kitchen-tackle can stand or hang; a bunkerpress [window seat chest] is <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the new window; at the foot end of the bed is another large press (once &#x201C;Box-bed,&#x201D; but painted and altered now); a chest of drawers and clock (shone on by the old window) occupy the other wall. There is a good thick rustic carpet all over the floor; fuel-box on the right hand side of the fire, well screened by the little four-footed table, which is kitchen-table, and stands level with the sill of the new window. I am afraid, dear Jack, you have already lost your reckoning in all this; however I determined <pb id="pg-08-238" n="08:238"/>to let you have a trial at picturing out the abode kindliest to you of all others in this Earth. It is more significant to mention that &#x201C;Isabella,&#x201D; Jamie&#x2019;s wife, is a very nice-looking rational natural country woman, with whom it is quite easy to live with my Mother&#x2019;s rational temper: hitherto I think they have all been a mere benefit to one another, and at <hi rend="italic">no</hi> time, even by chance, anything else. Jamie goes about rough and hearty as formerly, tho&#x2019; the last two years have been hard on him, as a farmer; bad harvests, prices never seen so low: however he struggles on, and &#x201C;can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> as usual.&#x201D; Isabella and he have a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Jamie, whom I hear croaking at this moment down stairs; a very giant of a fellow for his months, whom all the house often amuses itself with. In reference to Scotsbrig I must also add in a whisper that we have had a visit of Rob Haining<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning, who married Jenny on <date when="1836-03-15">15 March 1836</date>. He was a draper employed by a Mr. Craig in Manchester.</note> since I came: Rob Haining wonderfully transformed into a kind of Manchester buck; a most <foreign>shifty</foreign>-looking [active-looking] fellow, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any kind of speculation, but full of practical adroitness; whom, it is guessed, Jenny at length looks on with some favour. The youth is as I describe him; very likely to make loads of money: if Jenny dare risk him, <hi rend="italic">who</hi> has right to say her nay? Thus at Scotsbrig, with our Mother in tolerable health and cheerfulness of mind, and the rest healthily following their courses, all is as well as one has business to wish.&#x2014; As for Mary and Alick I doubt they feel the pressure of these miserable times more than is good: Mary&#x2019;s husband is one of the most industrious laborious men; but finds work sometimes scarce, and payment for it generally scarcer; if he can <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> himself and household (of wife and three fine children) by that occupation, it is thought to be <hi rend="italic">all</hi> he is doing. Mary is a most assiduous little wife, thrifty, tidy; Jamie talks often of America,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Austin, Mary&#x2019;s husband. They did not go.</note> but she will not hear of that yet. Poor Alick I think is still worse situated; at the Howes without profitable occupation or outlook, with an injudicious helpmate, a vehement mind, and habits which are not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> bad, but which decidedly give one qualms sometimes. He has made nothing of that summer&#x2019;s jobbing but lost some twenty pounds; and has now given it up. He has been with me a good deal; and I have talked with him as my own languor and dispiritment would allow: his temper is tolerably clear and deliberate; he finds there is distinctly nothing to be done in the trade-way at Annan (which is greatly fallen, of late); he has some aim towards <hi rend="italic">the Orchard</hi> farm, near by this; but small reasonable hope of getting it on <pb id="pg-08-239" n="08:239"/>terms that will enable him to <hi rend="italic">live;</hi> elsewhere in this country nothing at all in the shape of prospect. He speaks, not much but with a certain tone of resolve about upper Canada in the spring. It is a stern resolution; but really one knows not how to dissuade him. The aspect of everything among the working men of this country fills one with trouble and sorrow. Alick went from Scotsbrig this morning to go home tonight: he has been here exclusively several days; working at the repair of the Ecclefechan houses<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The houses left to Carlyle&#x2019;s mother by his father; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320522-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:161</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-05-22">22 May 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> with a mason; I mean if the day be good to go down to him tomorrow (Sunday), and speak with him by ourselves: tho&#x2019; what to advise him I know not. I am <foreign>wae</foreign>, very <foreign>wae</foreign> to think of what seems to await us: but one should be prepared for the inevitable, acknowledge it as the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>. Alick&#x2019;s main possession, I think, will be his children; his eldest <foreign>lassie</foreign>, especially, is a very fine wise little creature; and he loves them much.&#x2014; I told you I had been at Dumfries too; I was twice there. Jeans<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning Jean.</note> looks well, like a young mother; blithe and <foreign>douce</foreign>; a very clever, clear, brave woman. Her James also displays himself as a punctual faithful very intelligent man; and makes way in his business, and what is better a right <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of way. They are in the house our Uncle John lived in, and seem very happy together. Their little son Alick is a queer looking little cricket of a creature, without speech yet, but with sense for three times its bulk; not thriving very well, tho&#x2019; better now than of late. You have, at the present time, <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> nephews and nieces. As I said to Jane, &#x201C;there is a <hi rend="italic">quackling</hi> and rocking in all these houses: one generation passeth away, and another cometh.&#x201D;&#x2014; (My Mother has just been here with a driblet of whisky and water; for it is afternoon.)</p>
<p>I have seen Grahame and Nelson, and even since your Letter came; and delivered your compliments. Ben they say has been <hi rend="italic">scandalled</hi> somewhat about a maid-servant that went away from his house a <hi rend="italic">mother</hi> and no maid: but, as I hear, most probably <hi rend="italic">without</hi> ground. He had nothing new to set forth when we met; looked considerably hoarier and older. I yesterday (Jenny and I having ridden to Annan) saw for the second time the youth Edward;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Nelson; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:366</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> as taciturn, abrupt of manner as ever: he goes to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> this winter to graduate; is studying all manner of things: he wants <hi rend="italic">affection</hi>, that youth, and will not I doubt come to much. Waugh I saw twice on former days; a very imbecile man: he is writing a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> &#x201C;Theory of Medicine&#x201D; or something <pb id="pg-08-240" n="08:240"/>like that, and on sabbaths a &#x201C;Commentary on the Revelations&#x201D;;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351006-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1835-10-06">6 Oct.</date></ref></note> practices what is indispensable for (coarse) victual with Aunt Marion; farther not; looks old, yellow, crowfoo<supplied>[t, in]</supplied>different towards all persons. Man cannot help that man: insanity, to a considerable extent, has marked him for her own. It was Annan Fair when I went thither the previous time: old houses and streets with a thoroughly new people in them; not one in the two hundred whom I recognised. I called on Tom Grahame and his Sister: T. is from America; the old straggling <hi rend="italic">brambly</hi> unprofitable man: in the Town Council he last year struck Dr Thom<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. William Thom; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280201-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:320</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-02-01">1 Feb. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> unexpectedly, yet not without provocation, on the <hi rend="italic">seat of honour</hi>, and has had damages (&#xa3;80) to pay for it. He lives now on his means; has a house in Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> does not attempt Advocateship; will be nothing in life, but a consumer of fruits. Other Annan people I did not see: old Mrs Irving,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350110-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1835-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref></note> whom I had mind of, they told me had been <hi rend="italic">given to Spirits:</hi> I did not like to venture.

I cannot but love the sociable large heart of Grahame; otherwise there were <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> in him for me. They all, these people, asked kindly after &#x201C;my Brother&#x201D;; whose posture at present I had to describe with more or less minuteness. I have endeavoured to live in perfect solitude since I came hither; but have nevertheless had people enough about me. There is a considerable curiosity about me, &#x201C;the literary man&#x201D;; which paints itself in strange figures in the rustic imagination. Clow of Land they tell me is a declared admirer: I saw him twice here, and have had to promise that I would go to him. Wull Brown&#x2019;s daughter (a female Wull, so like him is she, with youth and femininity); Wull himself: <hi rend="italic">eet-a!</hi><note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A phrase connected with Wull Brown; cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311220-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:69</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-12-20">20 Dec. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> He was here last night, with others. Nothing suits me so ill at present as the company of men. Rest, rest: that is all I ask of the world at present.</p>
<p>But, alas, dear Jack, the sheet being so near full, how can I enter on my own multitudinous humours and interests by this opportunity? Suppose it, thyself; it is all as might have been supposed! I felt more shattered, <hi rend="italic">excoriated</hi>, sensitive to all things on getting hither than I <pb id="pg-08-241" n="08:241"/>looked for: but I really feel better for the journey, and shall be stronger. It is like the Rhinoceros&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">mudbath;</hi> or in more respectful terms, like Antaeus, flung to the <hi rend="italic">Earth</hi> for a new supply of strength. I am sometimes sad enough; but that too is profitable. <hi rend="italic">Reality</hi> is always profitable, be what it like. I have moments of inexpressible beauty, like auroral gleams, on a sky all <hi rend="italic">black</hi>. My Book seems inexpressibly despicable; however, I will write it: after that there remains for me&#x2014;? On the whole, exactly what God has appointed! Therefore we will take it thankfully. Jane writes to me that she is getting better and better: her Mother stays till I return; all for the present goes on as it was wont there. My day of return is not fixed yet: very likely the Tuesday or Friday of week next but one; the Steam-boat being then at a right hour. I have had troublesome work, hiring servants: I have got one, an Annan <foreign>Lass</foreign>, of promising aspect, who is to go with me; who we hope will be a great blessing at Chelsea.&#x2014; I do not wish to stop a day in Liverpool; the racket of it cuts me quite asunder. Last time I only waited till the Boat sailed; some five or six hours. I almost <hi rend="italic">fought</hi> myself away: Arbuckle escorting me. Poor Arbuckle! We shall hardly meet again. He was just about setting off, you must know, for Maranham (near Pernambuco, S. America) a Cotton Station of English and Portuguese, to practice there: &#xa3;300 a year certain, &#x26; what he can make. We parted solemnly, at one in the morning; as I shall always remember. He commended himself affectionately to you: would have written, but &#x26;c &#x26;c.&#x2014; Here is my Mother come to hear this read over, and send her message before it be sealed up. To the margins next!</p>
<p>[In margins:]</p>
<p>My Mother has heard this <foreign><hi rend="italic">blash</hi></foreign> [weak mixture] read over, and approves of it, <foreign><hi rend="italic">blash</hi></foreign> as it is: she would send &#x201C;a hundred messages but has not words to put them in.&#x201D; She commends you for counsel to the Great Source of Guidance; trusts He will counsel you what is best. I am not to forget that she would like <hi rend="italic">unco&#x2019; weel</hi> to have a Letter for herself from you. I asked her what you could say to her that were specially acceptable? &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Aught</hi>, except cursing and swearing&#x201D;! I promised that you would write to herself soon, as she desired. We had already made up our minds that you were likely to stay at Munich over winter, and thought it best so. What you are to do next time when it comes will shew. I perceive a new project in your last Letter: of <hi rend="italic">continuing</hi> should the Lady need you. Who knows whether this were better, or even not better? Your own feeling must have great weight in it: no man can counsel with any effect: it is enough to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what is before one to be done. We shall figure you as much freer <pb id="pg-08-242" n="08:242"/>and more contented while at Munich.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written that Lady Clare &#x201C;values and respects me though I have often assailed her aristocratic prejudices in simple and strong language so as to put her out of humour for the time. &#x2026; My present opinion is that Lady Clare will not go to Rome for the winter, and I have not the smallest intention of going with her if she should. If she stay in Munich and wish me to remain with her, I shall take time to consider whether I will do so or not. A few days may enable me to judge more properly than I could at present. Munich as you remarked is a sort of half-home, &#x26; the more so as I am now situated being comparatively quite free.&#x201D;</note> Be diligent; be clear, and justminded. Let us all be, and all will be well. <closer><salute>God bless you ever!</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>
<ps><p>There were tents on Burnswark (of Military Surveyors), right upon the old Roman Camp; very curious to see: the new transient upon the old perennial. They are gone now. Have you ever seen the Comet? I have; only twice: the first time, with its long train, in the solitude of Scotsbrig, it was very august, almost awful.</p>
<p>I have written to R.

I have forgot a hundred things. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu!</foreign></salute></closer></p>
<p>Jane &#x26; her Husband have arrived this instant&#x2014;on foot; and send
their love along with all the rest. I was about sealing when they entered. Pity Alick was off to Annan!&#x2014;</p>

<salute><foreign>Caro e rispettabile il mio Marito!</foreign></salute>
<p><foreign>Mi pare, che voi siete assai irrecordevole della vostra povera piccola! questi vostri lungi silenzi, questa la vostra lunga assenza mi <pb id="pg-08-243" n="08:243"/>divengono noiozi. Ritornate Mio Marito Ritornate, in nome di Dio, alla vostra casa! In vano Stimabili Signori vengono in gran numero mi far&#x2019; adorazione! In vano mangio carne di porco e recomincio esser una bella Gooda! In vano mi sforzo m&#x2019;occupare, mi divertare, mi facere contenta! Nell&#x2019; assenza del mio Marito rimango sempre inquieta, sempre perduta! Si pero, voi trovatevi meglio nel&#x2019; paese, si la preziosa vostra sanita diviene piu forte, la vostra anima piu chiara piu tranquilla non avete pensiero di me&#x2014; Bisogna ch&#x2019; io sottometto la mia voglia alla vostra prosperita e faro il piu meglio possibile esser paziente. Ecco come sono stata studiosa mio Marito! Tutta questa bellissima Italiana e scritta senza dizionario, senza studia, con penna corrente. Il Conte de Pepoli se ne maraviglia al divino mio talento; lascia i suoi alti complimenti, e dice salamente in sotto voce &#x201C;Ah graziosa! Ah bella bella. Ah Ah.</foreign>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dear and respectable husband of mine! / It seems to me, that you are very forgetful of your poor little one! These long silences of yours and your long absence are becoming annoying to me. Return husband of mine Return, in God&#x2019;s name, to your house! In vain do worthy gentlemen come in great number to court me! In vain do I eat pork meat and begin again to be a beautiful Goody! In vain do I try to busy myself, to amuse myself, to make myself happy! In the absence of my husband I remain always worried, always lost! If, however, you are faring better in the country, if your precious health is improving, your spirit clearer and calmer do not worry about me&#x2014; I need to submit my will to your welfare and I will do my best to be patient. You can see how studious I have been, my dear husband! All this beautiful Italian is written without dictionary, without study, with a flowing pen. The Count de Pepoli marvels at this divine talent of mine; he forgoes his high praises and simply says in low tones &#x2018;Ah precious one! Ah beautiful beautiful. Ah Ah.&#x2019;&#x201D; Jane&#x2019;s Italian is rather carefree and has mistakes affected by her knowledge of French.</note></p>
<p><salute>Dear my Husband&#x2014;</salute> You have probably enough of this, as well as I; so now in English I repeat that I expect with impatience the letter which is to fix your return. So long; I have reason to be thankful that I have been born<supplied>[e]</supplied> thro with an honourable thro&#x2019; bearing<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Helpless phrase of a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> conceited <foreign>extempore</foreign> Preacher&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note><supplied>[;]</supplied> except for too [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] days before your last letter arrived I flatter myself I have been conducting myself with a quite exemplary patience and good nature towards all men women children and inanimate things. <foreign>Ecco la bella prova di che, Sereetha sta sempre qui; e la mia Madre ed io non sono ancor imbrogliate</foreign>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Here is an excellent proof of this that Sereetha is still here; and my mother and I are not yet at odds.&#x201D; The meaning and implication of &#x201C;imbrogliate&#x201D; as used here is uncertain.</note></p>
<p>What a world of beautiful effort you have had to expend on this matter of the servant! Heaven grant it may be blessed to us! I do not <pb id="pg-08-244" n="08:244"/>know well why; but I like the abstract idea of this woman<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ann C<hi rend="italic">k</hi>&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> much better than the other&#x2014; It seemed to me rather an objection to the other that she had a Brother a Baker&#x2014; The Bakers, you know, <hi rend="italic">trade in servants</hi> here, and he would probably have soon been reccomending [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] her into a more <hi rend="italic">exalted</hi> place. Moreover it was a thought displeasing to me, that she had been educated in the school of country gigmanism&#x2014;Macturkdomism and Gillenbierigism<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Annandale = &#x2018;genteel&#x2019; places and persons&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> is just as hateful or more hateful to me than Devonshire housism.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unclear but possibly using the Duke of Devonshire&#x2019;s household as a symbol of fashionable behaviour.</note> the &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">uz</hi>&#x201D;ing woman, of tarnished virtue, will suit I think much better.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Cook. &#x201C;Appears to have had what they call a &#x2018;misfortune&#x2019; there. &#x2018;The <hi rend="italic">uz</hi>ing,&#x2019; some feature of pronunciat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have now forgotten&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).

The child was cared for by Ann Cook&#x2019;s mother after Ann&#x2019;s departure for London.</note> In fact, it would be difficult for <hi rend="small-caps">me</hi> to say that an Annandale woman&#x2019;s virtue is the worse for a misfortune&#x2014; I am certain that in their circumstances, with their views and examples I should have had <hi rend="italic">one</hi> too if not more. And now that the best is done, which could be done, let us quiet ourselves and look with equanimity towards the issue&#x2014; If she does not do better than those that have gone before<supplied>[,]</supplied> if <hi rend="small-caps">no</hi> grown <hi rend="italic">servant</hi> any longer exists on this earth why we can certainly manage with an <hi rend="italic">ungrown</hi> one&#x2014;Sereetha has hardly been a fair trial of the little girl-plan&#x2014;but she has been <hi rend="italic">a trial</hi>&#x2014;and I am confident of being able to get on quite peacably [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] with one of <hi rend="small-caps">such</hi> little girls as I doubt not are to be found in plenty. With only a giving up of a few hours of my own time which might easily be worse spent and the sacrifice of the beauty and <hi rend="italic">ladylikeness</hi> of my <hi rend="italic">hands</hi>. For <hi rend="small-caps">economy</hi>, little I find is to be gained by the substitution of a child for a woman. The washing runs away with all, the difference in wages and their consumption of victual is much the same&#x2014;but then the things <hi rend="small-caps">are</hi> washed <hi rend="italic">beautifully</hi> and I <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> beautifully, when <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do not dishearten me with hypercriticism. So never fear dearest&#x2014;never fear about that or anything else under Heaven. Try all that ever you can to be patient and good-natured, with your <foreign>povera piccola Gooda</foreign> [poor little Goody],<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Goody, with diminutives &#x2018;Goodykin&#x2019; &#x26;c, the common name she had from me&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> and then she loves you, and is ready to do anything on earth that you wish, to fly over the moon if you bade her.

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>There are moods one falls into, wherein speech is of all tasks the most frightful and also the most unprofitable; other moods I have known wherein speech tho&#x2019; still frightful was not unprofitable but the contrary: we shall flatter ourselves that it is only under the latter category I have come today, when driven on by an unquiet conscience I in the laziest manner take up the pen for you. The spirit is willing, but O how weak is the flesh!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 26:41.</note> In fact, I should not have promised, or should only have promised conditionally: on condition that the <hi rend="italic">Daimon</hi> impelled me to do it. In that case, you had saved some small <foreign>peculium</foreign> of postage, which the Patriot King<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340522-TC-JHLH-01"><sic>7:190</sic><corr>TC to JHLH, <date when="1834-05-22">22 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> (with a blessing to him!) will now get; and I had passed another morning languidly drifting among this wreck of all highest and lowest things; a Chaos of sights, remembrances, emotions, Prophecy brought suddenly side by side with Cattle-dealing, fragments of the Empyrean tumbling confusedly amid floating masses of Annandale Peat-bog! Alas, I am afloat, and all is afloat; and I have flung myself down, and said: Be it so then; only let it be without farther effort of mine. To speak in articulate sentences about all this matter, or about any matter whatever, is such a task as you may fancy. Could I play on any violin or trombone, or rather on a hundred violins and trombones at once, I would thunder you out a whole crash of preternatural fiddling, or some such thing; and that were my speech.</p>
<p>The best news is, first that I am coming home to you again very soon; it would have been tomorrow but the Liverpool Steamboat did not answer in its hour: secondly that I feel much strengthened by this rustication of mine, am really far healthier than when we parted. I did not, know till plumped all at once out of the noisy sin and misery of London into the solitude of the old innocent Earth here (which at lowest afflicts you only with mud and rain), how fretted and shattered, and altogether exasperated off my just balance, I had been: all things produced such a disproportionate diseased impression on me; my little Sister singing a Scotch song was like to set me a-crying; the <pb id="pg-08-249" n="08:249"/>clear brooks ran each with the beauty of an Eurotas or Siloa<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The river Eurotas flows through Southern Peloponnesus to the Gulf of Laconia. For the pool of Siloa or Siloam in Jerusalem cf. Isa. 8:6; <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> I, 11, and <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250624-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:340</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-06-24">24 June 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> for me; on the other hand, the stupidity of fools was enough to drive one <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>. Alas, there is no health in London, for the body or the mind. It is a feverdream there of double and treble feverishness; a mad dream,&#x2014;from which one awakes in Eternity! Unhappy that the tools for your work; that the free heart of your fellow man, opened fearlessly towards you fearless, were it only once in the thousand trials, is nowhere else to be met with. One must take the evil and the good.</p>
<p>On the whole, I have been, comparatively speaking, very happy here. There is the truest affection, which no colour of Fortune, not mishap or even misconduct could alter, all round me; there are no riches in any King&#x2019;s Treasury<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Esther 3:9.</note> that will weigh against this. Then farther one has <hi rend="italic">quietness:</hi> sweet inexpressibly are these pale still days; the air noiseless, the very barndoor fowls fallen silent; only the voice of some husbandman peaceably directing his thatchers and potatoe-diggers (all visible far and wide if you stroll out); or perhaps, at evening, of some acre or two of <hi rend="italic">crows</hi>, making wing to the rooky wood, generally engaged in rather <hi rend="italic">loud</hi> conversation. And all the waggons, hackney and glass coaches, dog-carts, nightmen, daymen, noblemen, gentlemen, gigmen, grinding along at the distance of 319 miles from you; the smoke of their torment ascending up <hi rend="italic">there!</hi> It is a free open region of knolls and brooks, fringed only with hawthorn, with natural brushwood in the craggy dingles; planted wood-groups not enough for shelter, far from imprisonment, from obcaecation!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An obsolete word meaning mental or spiritual blindness.</note> A hundred yards from this fire-place I can see, as it were, all the kingdoms of the world: the Solway, grown quicksilver, all out to Saint-Bees, Carlisle smoke and Annan Steeple; the thousand craggy summits of Galloway, of Cumberland Yorkshire, on this hand and on that; and noticed yesterday that Skiddaw and Helvellyn, for example, had put on their white hair-powder,&#x2014;the cold of winter being at hand. Nay close by on the edge of my native Burnswark there sat till a week ago three white military tents (making &#x201C;Great Military Survey,&#x201D; I understand), directly on the spot where Agricola still declares that he planted himself near eighteen hundred years before;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julius Agricola (<date when="0040-00-00">40</date>&#x2013;<date when="0093-00-00">93</date>), governor of Britain, <date when="0078-00-00">78</date>&#x2013;<date when="0085-00-00">85</date>. The military camp of Blatobulgium (now called Birrens) was possibly built as part of Agricola&#x2019;s northern campaigns of <date when="0081-00-00">81</date> and <date when="0082-00-00">82 A.D.</date> (cf. Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">Agricola</hi>, 23&#x2013;24) or was a later outpost of Hadrian&#x2019;s Wall.</note> for his <foreign><hi rend="italic">vallums</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-08-250" n="08:250"/>[ramparts], his <foreign><hi rend="italic">aggers</hi></foreign> [mounds], and all the rest, have lain quite unmolested ever since except by the rains and the small hoofs of sheep; and are all there as fresh as life; the very well, as is natural for it, bubbling up its waters yet, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> on the Artesian principle. To see these white canvas houses built close beside the old green conic mounds (also three in number) with so different an object was worth a turning of the eye. Farther I have seen &#x201C;the Comet&#x201D;; tho&#x2019; not looking for it! The wonder hung himself out gratuitously for me, one night, while he journeyed near the Greater Bear: really a most singular nebulous-looking fellow; confused sulky, as large as your watch, and then with a great train or ribbon at him, a fathom long, woven apparently of moonbeams;&#x2014;hurrying on, with high-pressure speed, God knows whence, God knows whither, and on what business! The sight of him struck me unexpectedly, under the still night, with astonishment, almost with awe. Who could but say to him: Hail, thou brother Thing; created also by God; welcome out of Immensity, be thy intents wicked or charitable! At that moment, how much wiser, <hi rend="italic">truer</hi> seemed the superstitious terror of the Old Time, when the eye, if opened superstitiously, was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">shut</hi> to Nature, but worshipped her, than the &#x201C;small difficult crowing&#x201D; and triumphant quackle-quackling of the Diffusion Society intent only on sine and cosine!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Society for Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. The Newspapers were full of charts and timetables of the nearest approaches of the Comet to the Great Bear.</note> But to speak in the Progress-of-the-species dialect, shall we not one day have the latter and yet not want the former? Even Diffusion society is a progress; <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of a step, the <hi rend="italic">falling</hi> part of it: for it is a great truth (true in a thousand senses) that all &#x201C;walking is but a succession of f<supplied>[alls.&#x201D;]</supplied><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330613-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:402</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-06-13">13 June 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> In this manner then I spend the bright weather of my St. Martin&#x2019;s Summer; all the brighter that there come ever and anon horrid days of rain and tempest, with noise, leaves and desolation; and then as suddenly cease: like bullyings from a choleric person (named Winter) that is not yet in free wrath, but only getting into it. I avoid all gigmen, nearly altogether, am shy even of men lest they disturb me; I read no Books whatever, except pieces of the Bible and&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">Histoire Parlementaire</hi>.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340901-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>7:289</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1834-09-01">1 Sept. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note>
Of the Bible I seem to get more and more understanding, deeper and deeper reverence. It is a Book written by men that <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> the thing they were writing. Who could fancy there were such a worth in that; and yet there is. Of the &#x201C;Hist. Parl.&#x201D; and whole French Revolution a History in three Books I make exceedingly little at present. Miserable does it seem, miserable I in the midst of it. <pb id="pg-08-251" n="08:251"/>The whole Business lies round me in vague cloudy masses; far, very far from living form. The part I have formed, or written, looks detestablest of all; fit only a second time for the fire. Nevertheless I at no moment hesitate that I must write it out, and then wash my hands. Then for the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> thing!</p>
<p>As you say, I am delivered from Newspapers;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had said in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1835-10-17">17 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I suspect you must be nearly confined to indoor pleasures in Dumfriesshire now, for there can be little comfort in ranging the moors with such weather as we have had, of which you have probably had an enlarged edition. You have the good fortune at any rate to be free from newspapers.&#x201D; He then listed some of the more dramatic news stories of the day. See Mineka, XII, 278.</note> yet not from the echo of Newspapers, from din and complaint, and the sight of a whole people slowly <hi rend="italic">revolting</hi> against their old Manner of Existence. &#x201C;Voluntary Church&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350810-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-08-10">10 Aug.</date></ref></note> is the main word here; uttered with a composed emphasis, and by all people, the most religious seemingly the most emphatic. Our poor old Church of Scotland clutches at the skirts of Episcopacy (not wisely I think); and so reels hither and thither as <hi rend="italic">she</hi> reels, and will go to the Abyss with her one might calculate. A Tobacconist in Dumfries has gained immortal glory, it would seem, by confuting and dumfounding whole Presbyteries of Reverend Involuntaries, who in evil hour had ventured on a Public Meeting to exhibit the religious and loyal spirit of the Scottish People.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a reference to a Synod meeting of 45 ministers and 15 elders in Dumfries on <date when="1835-10-20">20 Oct.</date> The tobacconist&#x2019;s name, possibly Mundell or William Fraser, was not noted in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> report of <date when="1835-10-28">28 Oct.</date></note> When the sheep begin all <hi rend="italic">baa</hi>ing and even butting against the shepherd, it has an ill look for him.</p>
<p>A man, not a gigman, but whose company I should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have preferred to yours at this moment breaks in upon me; I have to conclude even faster than I meant. You have what I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> say; not the millionth part of what I would! However on Sunday come a week (Sunday <hi rend="italic">first</hi> for you) I almost calculate that you may see me at Chelsea, if you like to come down, if no evil befal. There is then, as you observe, freer field for communing. Freer truly; or it were evil with us! Remember me very kindly to Grant. Say at Kent Terrace<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Harriet Taylor lived.</note> that I hope soon to walk thither, and make my compliments in person. All is confused about me at present; I myself am confusion worse confounded!<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 996.</note> Nevertheless we still hope, still endeavour. <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Vale mei memor</hi></foreign> [Goodbye remember me]!</salute></closer></p>

Could I make proper despatch, and have no delay after sealing, there were even a possibility of saving <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day&#x2019;s post, and being a day better than my word. We shall see: but interruptions are many, and liabilities to interruption. The thing I have to write, however, is of the briefest, and best: that thou shalt see me again by the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> conveyance southward; that this day week, if all go right, we shall be sitting together.</p>
<p>No steamboat leaves Annan till Friday; but on Friday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1835-11-06">6 Nov.</date></note> some time about noon, it is the purpose of Anne Cook and me to put to sea: on Saturday morning we shall be in the Docks of Liverpool; I will leave my Misfortunate at the Umpire Coach-Office in Dale Street, taking places (an outside and an inside probably, that we may alternate) for both of us; go myself in the interim to Maryland Street to breakfast; then finally start that same day about noon; and so, making that sorrowful fire-bath of travelling the shortest possible, hope to be at home to dine with my own Goody on the Sunday afternoon! Would I were there; for all is a burden to me, in this humour. We suppose, you see, that there are <hi rend="italic">seats</hi> in the Umpire on our arrival; likewise that it proves possible to merely call on our kind Maryland Street friends<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane&#x2019;s uncle, John Welsh, and his family.</note> without offence. I hope and almost believe it may turn out so; &#x201C;my soul longs to be free&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> of all that sort of thing, and straight home again: but one cannot certainly prophecy [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. About four o&#x2019;clock on Sunday great will be the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Coagitor&#x2019;s</hi></foreign> agitation, as I shall well know, whether there myself or not: however, if four o&#x2019;clock bring nothing of us, give it up for that day; and, unless a Newspaper with more precise tidings to the contrary arrive next morning, expect us with double assurance on the Monday. I told Mill (for my given promise forced me to scrawl something to him last week) that if he came to Chelsea on Sunday morning, he would probably find me: there is almost no likelihood that he will come; but if he do, consider only that I made a mistake <pb id="pg-08-253" n="08:253"/>and oversight in calculating, and nothing is wrong. O Goody, my own dear Goody!&#x2014; But all is glad-<foreign><hi rend="italic">waeness</hi></foreign>, dispiritment defiance, and on the whole <hi rend="italic">unspeakableness</hi> within me. Silence, and no attempt to speak, is therefore seemingly the best.</p>
<p>All people say, and what is more to the purpose I myself rather feel, that my health is greatly improved since I got hither. Alas, the state of wreckage I was in, &#x201C;fretted,&#x201D; as thou sayest, &#x201C;to fiddlestrings,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351026-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-26">26 Oct.</date></ref></note> was enormous. Even yet, after a month&#x2019;s idleness, and much recovery, I feel it all so well. Silence for a solar year: this, were it possible, would be my blessedness! All is so black confused about me, streaked with splendours too as of Heaven; and I the most helpless of mortals in the middle of it. I could say with Job of old: Have pity upon me, have <hi rend="italic">pity</hi> upon me, O my friends!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 19:21.</note> And thou, my poor Goody, depending on cheerful looks of <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> for thy cheerfulness! For God&#x2019;s sake, do not; or do so as little as possible<supplied>[.]</supplied> How I love thee, what I think of thee, it is not probable that thou or any mortal will know; but cheerful looks, when the heart feels slowly dying in floods of confusion and obstruction, are not the thing I have to give. Courage, however! Courage to the last! One thing, in the middle of this chaos, I can more and more determine to adhere to; it is now almost my sole rule of life: to <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> myself of Cants and formulas, as of poisonous Nessus&#x2019; shirts;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;The Hero as Man of Letters,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, V, 178.</note> to <hi rend="italic">strip</hi> them off me, by what name soever called; and follow, were it down to Hades, what I myself know and see. Pray God only that sight be given me, <hi rend="italic">free</hi>dom of eyes to see with: I fear nothing then; nay hope infinite things. It is a great misery however for a man to lie, even unconsciously, even to himself. Also I feel at this time as if I should never laugh more! Or rather say never sniff and whiffle and <hi rend="italic">pretend</hi> to laugh more. The despicable titter of a &#x201C;Duke,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Lord Jeffrey, &#x201C;Duke of Craigcrook.&#x201D;</note> for example, seems to me quite <hi rend="italic">criminally</hi> small. Life is no frivolity, or hypothetical coquetry or whifflery: it is a great <hi rend="italic">world</hi> of a truth that we are alive; that I am alive;&#x2014;that I saw the &#x201C;Sweet Milk Well&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Water of Milk; cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250624-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:340</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-06-24">24 June 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> yesterday; flowing (for the last four thousand years) from its three sources on the hillside; the origin of Middlebie Burn; and noted the little dell it had hollowed out all the way, and the huts of Adam&#x2019;s Posterity built sluttishly on its course; and a Sun shining overhead, ninety millions of miles off; and Eternity all round; and Life <pb id="pg-08-254" n="08:254"/>a vision, dream and yet fact,&#x2014;woven, with uproar, on the Loom of Time!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

I am actually very considerably better than when we parted.</p>
<p>How the sheet goes, in mere froth and ineptitude! But indeed there is hardly anything of the narrative sort I have to give since writing last: I seem to have done <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> but lie and sleep (I reach to <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> now every morning). There have two Barrels gone off for Chelsea, by way of Whitehaven and the Land&#x2019;s End. One is full of new oatmeal; the second and larger, of <hi rend="italic">potatoes;</hi> with two hams, with <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>. The &#x201C;keg of herrings&#x201D; could have been got, had we known one day sooner; but the Barrels were gone the day before your Letter came. If that conveyance prove as cheap as I expect, we may apply to it again more readily than to the other. I have had two Letters, in answer to two of mine (for it seemed a duty, and I <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> myself): one from Henry Inglis, one from your Uncle Robert. It was about poor Cousin Tom,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351021-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1835-10-21">21 Oct.</date></ref></note> wanting to be a Lawyer&#x2019;s clerk in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Robert writes with promptitude, with the cle<supplied>[arness]</supplied> of a business man, with unusual cordiality for him. It is even possible that he himself may have room for Tom, which I should reckon fortunate, and likely to be suitable; at all events, he explains, directs, promises, in an authentic kind of way, to help. Henry Inglis would if he could; with zeal, but with less knowledge. The poor Boy Tom must do with it what he can: he is a very good sensible fellow, and promises to do well; tho&#x2019; sorely bested at present, without adviser in the world, with but small means of money, his Mother gone quite <hi rend="italic">crazy</hi> &#x26;c. I saw him last night, and gave him my final advices.&#x2014; Except twice to Annan, about clothes &#x26;c, I have been nowhere. Graham of Burnswark has missed me ever since that day; neither were Aitken<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Aitken; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270217-TC-DA-01"><sic>4:192</sic><corr>TC to DA, <date when="1827-02-17">17 Feb. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> nor Menzies there then: only a Letter from Aitken, inviting me&#x2014;to Minto. No Craigenputtoch, no Templand. On Wednesday last there came a bundle from Jean, or rather thro&#x2019; Jean&#x2019;s hands and <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Mary Milligan,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a needlewoman of Grace Welsh&#x2019;s.</note> as I judged. There were three sufficient Night-shirts, and a small note directed &#x201C;Mrs Welsh,&#x201D; which I keep; both of which, for their respective owners. Four stocking-boards have come; of the amplest size! Shoes and lasts I expect by Annan tomorrow. The Misfortunate is all ready for packing: I will take my Good Janekin in my arms (and to my heart) if the <pb id="pg-08-255" n="08:255"/>Powers allow on the day I said.&#x2014; The sheet is all but done, and no word of thanks for your fine Italian-English Letter;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351026-JWC-TC-01"><date when="1835-10-26">26 Oct.</date></ref></note> which I read three times (actually), and did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> burn. It is the best news to me that you are getting better, that you feel cheerful as your writing indicated. My poor Goody! It seems as if she could so easily be happy; and the easy means are so seldom there. Let us take it bravely, honestly; it will not beat us <hi rend="italic">both</hi>. What you say of the Sofa is interesting more than I like to confess. May <hi rend="italic">it</hi> be good for us! I feel as if an immeasurable everlasting sofa were precisely the thing I wanted even now. O dear, I wish I were there, on the &#x201C;simple greatness&#x201D; of that one such as it is, and Goody might be as <hi rend="italic">near</hi> me as she liked.&#x2014; <foreign>Hadere nicht mit deinem Mutter, Liebstes!

<p><salute>My Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>It is now full time that I should write to you: I have been here some three or even four weeks in safety; your Letter to our Mother arrived some days before my leaving Scotsbrig; the Letter by a private hand to myself has been lying in the Drawer for above a week. I wished to have attained some kind of fixation before writing, and to be able to inform you that I was fairly at work again. This evening (for Jane declares she will not let me work in the evenings) I propose to spend with you, be the <hi rend="italic">fixation</hi> as it may: I feel how impatient you must be getting to hear of me fixed or unfixed.</p>
<p>I quitted Scotsbrig on the first friday morning of the month:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1835-11-06">6 Nov.</date></note> very drizzly weather, and all of us naturally dispirited; yet none absolutely giving way to vain sorrow. My Mother took sad leave of me at the door in the murky drizzle of the morning; I saw her again as Alick and I rode up the Purdamstown <foreign>brae</foreign> on the other side of the <foreign>burn</foreign>: the faint figure of her was standing watching us within the window; silent, dimly visible: one of those sights, as I said then to myself, that thro&#x2019; all time one never will forget. At Annan Ben Nelson insisted, in spite of the rain, on accompanying me to Waterfoot; Alick and Jamie walked with us over the Hill-End; Jamie Austin had gone before with the luggage. As ill-luck, grounded on Ben&#x2019;s false tidings would have it, the Steamboat was clearly <hi rend="italic">in motion</hi> when we got sight of her: it became a racing, a hailing of boats; a jumping in and steering in hot hurlyburly: when my luggage, saved from the jaws of the flood lay on deck, and I turned round to wave farewell, my Friends were all faded from my eyes, I was looking on the dull sandhills of Newbie. Annandale and what it held was gone in that hasty fashion; lost to me, one other time. We reached Liverpool next morning; waited only some three hours; then off by a famed Coach called the <hi rend="italic">Umpire</hi> to London at one stretch. On Sunday night about dusk, a wretched vehicle landed us here; as wholly wretched, at least me wholly so, tho&#x2019; the kind welcome, a cup of excellent Madeira and dinner partially <pb id="pg-08-257" n="08:257"/>set me up again. The Annan serving woman (for it is she that makes the plural number) had stood the whole business with the humour of a Chactaw Squaw, and needed only a glass of rum punch to make her better than ever: a hardy, impassive, <foreign>shifty</foreign> piece of true Annandale stuff, who promises to do excellently well here, and be a very great accommodation to us. Cockney helps, of all colours, had grown nigh unsufferable to us. I do not think you know this young woman: she is called Cook, her father was a tanner with old Gavin Irving and now &#x201C;carries the Letters&#x201D; of the Borough: the creature herself is dusky of skin, loud Annandale-melodious of speech, and had &#x201C;a misfortune&#x201D;! However she is whole of heart, deft of hand, an appurtenance of the household, and will last for a year, the length of her term, with advantage to us.</p>
<p>The state of Scotsbrig, I think, was pretty fully delineated to you last Letter. Nothing new had happened; all seemed settled for the winter. Our good Mother you may fancy as sitting in warm enough quarters yonder, with blazing Whitehaven coal amid the piping winds; reading, nursing the young <hi rend="italic">Jamie</hi> (a tremendously heavy fellow of his months) or otherwise peaceably filling up her time. I got a frank, and wrote to her fully the week after my arrival: I have since sent an old stout folio &#x201C;Baker&#x2019;s Chronicle,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Richard Baker (<date when="1568-00-00">1568</date>&#x2013;<date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>), <hi rend="italic">A Chronicle of the Kings of England from the time of the Romans government unto the raigne of our soueraigne Lord King Charles</hi> (London, <date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>). Later editions, e.g. London, <date when="1730-00-00">1730</date>, included a continuation to Charles II by Edward Phillips, Milton&#x2019;s nephew.</note> according to agreement, for winter reading (she liked it at Craigenputtoch formerly); a Newspaper or two go weekly; I have had one from Jenny, and three from Jean, acknowledging my news, and signifying that all is as I left it. Alick, reserving America as the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> shift, had begun again looking out for farms: &#x201C;the Orchard&#x201D; (Wurchit), Gullielands near Annan, and other small farms were to let; which he was clear for trying after.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-TC-JCHA-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCHA</corr>, <date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec.</date></ref></note> Nothing can exceed the depression of Agricultural things there at this time, no one thing to help another; wheat selling at 14 shillings the Carlisle bushel, which has been seen at three guineas, and in &#x201C;the dear years&#x201D; was as high as five. Jamie says he can <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> but will be very <foreign><hi rend="italic">tight hadden</hi></foreign> [hard going]. The American backwoods are a blessed Goshen,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The land of plenty allotted to Joseph&#x2019;s kin in Egypt, free from the plagues; cf. Gen. 45:10, Exod. 8:22. Hence any such land exempt from evils.</note> tho&#x2019; a wild one, for many. My heart bleeds to think of the unrhymed Tragedies of the Poor; and how able Editors and Customhouse Statistic men on all hands cry out, &#x201C;Prosperity <hi rend="italic">un</hi>exampled&#x201D;; <pb id="pg-08-258" n="08:258"/>and Peace, Peace, when there is no peace,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Jer. 6:14.</note>&#x2014;and cannot and ought not to be any. God turn it all to good! To me the contemplation of it is actually very painful.&#x2014; I saw old Cressfield once, and meant honestly to go and visit him some evening; but did not make it out; to my regret now. He is quite brisk in faculty tho&#x2019; looking very old: his son Frank has lost his wife in Australia;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. William Little of Cressfield, a house a mile south of Ecclefechan and built by Carlyle&#x2019;s father for &#xa3;100 (see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> intro. I. Campbell, p. 31). Dr. Little was one of the doctors who attended Margaret (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281126-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:419&#x2013;20</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-11-26">26 Nov. 1828</date></corr></ref>).

Doubtless I told you of Grahame, how friendly he was, how thick, stagnant and wearisome; full of his Mr <hi rend="italic">Men</hi>-sies (Menzies the new Minister of Hoddam), whom I absolutely would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> ride over to visit; not even tho&#x2019; David Aitken (dried to a <hi rend="italic">Kipper,</hi> soul and body, as I had seen him in London) was to be there. Poor Grahame! and yet I do like that friendly heart of his, the general home of all visible sons of Adam. He was very special inquiring your address &#x26;c; our Mother&#x2019;s Letter from you coming in while he was there, I read it nearly all to him. His good friend Johnstone of Grange, as perhaps I told you, was dead suddenly, and all was change and sorrow there. Worthy Tom Beattie<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> whom you recollect was thought to be dying of consumption; was making ready for Madiera, or Devonshire thro&#x2019; winter. By the last Dumfries Newspaper I find that James Hogg the Ettrick Shepherd is also gone;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hogg had died <date when="1835-11-21">21 Nov.</date> The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> noted his death on <date when="1835-11-25">25 Nov.</date>&#x2014;&#x201C;by far the most remarkable man that ever wore professionally a shepherd&#x2019;s plaid&#x201D; and had a fuller memoir, <date when="1835-12-02">2 Dec</date>. Carlyle also noted the death in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>.</note> would be buried this day in the church yard of Ettrick: dark mountain solitude covers up his grave then at this hour; the foolish guileless chirping or singing son of rough Scottish Nature is gone silent forever. The last time I saw him was in Bookseller Fraser&#x2019;s,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:89</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320122-TC-MAC-01"><sic>97</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1832-01-22">22 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> where also William Fraser was.&#x2014; At Annan I met with Tom Grahame, returned from a long tour in America; a withered, straggling, sceptico-pragmatical individual; of small value. Also, one night at Alick&#x2019;s, Wull of the Breconhill!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220222-TC-AC-01"><sic>2:54</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1822-02-22">22 Feb. 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> He is fat, fat, inclining to baldness; a snoring, attitudinizing sack of a man, greatly apprehensive of being laughed at: but on the whole incredibly improved; grown &#x201C;the honest lawyer,&#x201D; not distracted as one might have dreaded at seeing him of old. Poor Glen<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Still boarded out with Peter Austin, at Carstammon, near Craigenputtoch.</note> was the likest to him, tho&#x2019; of far deeper gift; and we see how <pb id="pg-08-259" n="08:259"/><hi rend="italic">he</hi> has gone: &#x201C;no improvement or change&#x201D; they answered me when I inquired. Waugh too was at Alick&#x2019;s that night; lisping mincing, an absurd mass of conceited inertia, not so much as looking sorry for himself; writing &#x201C;theories of Medicine&#x201D; rather, and speculating about the instantaneous &#x201C;success of a comedy.&#x201D; Ben Nelson is said to be deeply embarrassed in pecuniary matters: the son Edward took down your address, and talked of writing from Edinburgh. Here ends Annandale. I found a little bundle of medical Books left by Arbuckle for you at Liverpool: I suppose, borrowed; he himself was gone for S. America, and calculated to be there by that time. I brought the little Book parcel with me; I did not see George Johnstone, who has a house and his Mother: this brings me to London,&#x2014;something of the latest considering how my sheet looks! Let me add however here that your Miss Elliott had safely delivered her box to Fraser, by whom it was forthwith forwarded: she had sent her address and &#x201C;exchanged threepennies&#x201D; with Jane; all in great civility, with the sorrow &#x26;c, with the hope &#x26;c &#x201C;when she returned to town.&#x201D; I will call for her, the first word of notice I get. Mrs Jameson should have had her lithographs before now; but I learnt on inquiring that she was at Weimar. Your lady will find her by a simple address thither, I should think: the lithographs lie eating no bread. Finally let me mention that your money in the Dumfries Bank amounts to &#xa3;541, for which Mother will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> take the interest, let me speak to her as I would.</p>
<p>Your arrangement at Munich turns out as we expected it would: a stay for the winter, rejoiced at by all of us, since no better might be. We like to fancy you in that half-home, among your honest German brethren; it is far homelier, honester, nearer hand, than there by the Woman on Seven Hills. Doubly glad are we to find that you have medical employment: it is precisely the one thing needful for you there. Suppose you should see <hi rend="italic">continued</hi> practice inviting you at Munich? Or as you say, a few years longer of patience, and a reasonable annuity for life? The latter plan I like worse; but can dissuade or persuade on no side. England surely, except that it is one&#x2019;s country, is of all countries the least inviting at this moment; torn asunder with mean rabid factions, which will not get settled for a century; a country eating <hi rend="italic">itself,</hi> and without other work; the <hi rend="small-caps">supreme quack</hi>, in all departments, like to inherit it so long! One has to keep silence; and be dumb, not opening his mouth.&#x2014; Meanwhile enjoy Munich, my Boy, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what the day gives to be done there: <foreign><hi rend="italic">das weitere wird</hi></foreign> [anything further will &#x2026;] &#x26;c. That you have met William Fraser was naturally most interesting news to me. I have inquired often, very <pb id="pg-08-260" n="08:260"/>often about him, almost <hi rend="italic">without</hi> result till now; the monster &#x201C;Jerdan,&#x201D; of the &#x201C;Gazette,&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For William Jerdan of the <hi rend="italic">Literary Gazette,</hi> see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310717-FEF-G-01"><sic>5:307</sic><corr>FEF to G, <date when="1831-07-17">17 July 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> had not &#x201C;heard a word of him,&#x201D; two months ago,&#x2014;and was and remained a satyr-cannibal Literary Gazetteer; who shall live (<foreign><hi rend="italic">leben hoch</hi></foreign> [live high] if he like and can), only <hi rend="italic">far</hi> from me. I sent Fraser a <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k to Boulogne, and many remembrances; but neither they nor it seem to have reached him. Say all friendly things to him on my part; and bid him go on towards well doing unweariedly, not looking behind, not to this hand nor to that, but ever more resolutely towards the mark of the prize. It will give me the truest pleasure to learn that he is making the best of the much good that is in him; that past sorrows have all been precious lessons to him. I envy you the Speech of Schelling: there are few men in Europe I would go farther to see.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;In my last letter to my mother I mentioned that Wm. Fraser was here, and that I was frequently in the habit of seeing him. He seems much improved by his adversity. His wife and he love and respect each other; and she is one of the best little housewives I have seen, and as such infinitely valuable to him. They have a fine little child which they love unreasonably so as to make one anxious about them and it. I have seen it twice unwell, and, the first time a German Physician had been treating it before its mother knew of my being in Munich, and he would have done it a mischief with his calomel and other drugs. If Nature cured the disease, rather than my simple remedies, I could at least claim the merit of having rescued the little patient from a bad physician. Fraser is studying German diligently and speaking of studying Roman Law, taking what is called a <foreign><hi rend="italic">repetitor</hi></foreign> [<foreign><hi rend="italic">repetitorium:</hi></foreign> a course of lectures for candidates preparing for an examination] to direct and assist him. He desires to be kindly remembered to you. I have given him <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> to read, and after going through it once he keeps it for a second perusal. We laughed much at a story told us by an English Captain the other day, which bore upon a remarkable passage of Teufelsdreck. An English Lord had been assailed and stripped of all his clothes after being thought dead. The cavalry had gallopped over the place twice where he was lying. A French soldier had used his body for a shelter firing over it. Two hours after all the troops had been gone, he observed an English soldier to whom he made signs to approach, and said: &#x2018;I am Lord Ponsonby; if you&#x2019;ll carry me to head quarters I&#x2019;ll make it worth your while.&#x2019; &#x2018;Humbug! Imposture!&#x2019; replied the soldier, &#x2018;how the devil am I to know whether you are Lord P. or some rascal making use of his name? I&#x2019;ll have nothing to do with ye.&#x2019; Luckily for the unhappy Lord some fragments of his &#x2018;outward case&#x2019; remained about him on nearer investigation else he might have been left to perish. &#x2018;Indeed how was one to know him,&#x2019; as the Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> remarked, &#x2018;when he was quite naked?&#x2019; &#x2026;<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Lichtenthaler is better than he was in summer. Schelling is in the country still and I have not yet seen him since my arrival; having been always engaged in one way or another at the hour when he is visible.&#x201D; John&#x2019;s story refers to Sir Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), colonel of the 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Light Dragoons at Waterloo; his detailed description of his escape is not dissimilar from John&#x2019;s, though only his valuables and not his clothes were plundered, and the soldier far from doubting him guarded him for seven hours overnight until help could be fetched.

O&#x2019;Connell was eventually exonerated but meanwhile newspapers were publishing O&#x2019;Connell&#x2019;s attacks on Raphael as a &#x201C;mighty great liar&#x201D; and &#x201C;that most incomprehensible of all vagabonds,&#x201D; and then attacking him in their turn; see the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1835-11-13">13 Nov.</date></note> &#x201C;trash, trash, the penny-<hi rend="italic">vri</hi>ter&#x201D;; of which probably you hear too much thro&#x2019; the very newspapers of Munich. Silence of that! As for our own household there is this to be said, that we are all in fair health, that I am (most feebly) beginning to scribble again; that our friends are mostly gathering round us, and all is as you have known it before. Jane I found greatly improved; she still keeps well; amuses herself much speaking and writing Italian. I myself am feeblish, but clear: I mean to work cunningly, not by main force; I shall surely get done with this Book; and print it; and then&#x2014;?

But indeed often my soul is like to grow quite sick (it is that weary, weary <hi rend="italic">body</hi> rather); and I feel as if no resting place waited me on this side the <hi rend="italic">Great</hi> Ocean. It is a petulant weak thought; neither do I long to die till I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> my task. I think however I will quit Literature.&#x2014; Alas, here is Anne Cook with the porridge; puts an end to all speculation! This sheet cannot go tomorrow I believe, nor next day: I will fill the margins at my leisure: I have to see people, to do things; I shall still have somewhat to tell you. <closer><salute>Good night my dear Brother.

<ps><p>Monday Night, 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014; My dear Jack, this Letter which was written so far on friday must be finished tonight, to be off tomorrow. I am not in the best spirits, yet might have been in worse. On Saturday I went to dine at <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Mrs Taylors, expecting probably to meet Mill and a French Republican called Cavaignac;<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >E. L. Godefroy Cavaignac; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331217-TC-JSM-01"><sic>7:53</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-12-17">17 Dec. 1833</date></corr></ref>. See Frederick W.

Worse still, the fret and excitement &#x26;c of the thing (tho&#x2019; I dine most moderately) brought a cholic on me yesterday afternoon, pain, depression and an abstinence from food (a loathing of it) for some twenty hours. Today I have sat quite still, wrapt in a fleecy <hi rend="italic">plaid</hi> night gown which my Mother gave me, and now feel as if I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be even considerably <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> by the adventure. A dark <hi rend="italic">green</hi> cloud of bile had been hanging over me for long: in my left eye was occasionally a small speck of a <hi rend="italic">mote</hi> (very ugly to have coming dancing before you), which I do not notice now. My work also it is to be hoped will proceed better, and all be well that ends well. Tonight we were to go to the Rennies&#x2019;, but of course declined: tomorrow night to the Bullers&#x2019;, but that has been <hi rend="italic">postponed</hi>. That burnt volume has been a real misery to me; but I shall get stronger, and I have nothing but <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> work now.&#x2014; Today whom should we see here but Miss Morris! We had called twice at Baysw<hi rend="italic">r</hi> [Bayswater], since summer, but not found her. The young lady is looking well; making all sorts of inquiries about you, wondering when you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to get home. She is for Brighton again, till <date when="1836-01-00">January</date>. We propose to make her acquainted with Mr Dunn when she returns. An innocence and <foreign><hi rend="italic">schuchternheit</hi></foreign> [shyness] seem to be her main characteristics; but she has never yet got to any freedom of utterance with us. An aged devout &#x201C;Miss Hudson&#x201D; (I think) accompanied her hither.</p>
<lg><l>As journeys this Earth, her eye on a Sun, thro&#x2019; the Heavenly spaces,</l>

<l>Falters not, alters not; journeying equal, sunlit or stormgirt:</l>

<p>Is the pain <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> gone from the knee? That might have been a bad business.&#x2014; I impute my sickliness here to the bad water we have, which I am not yet got accustomed to. We have taken to using the Thames, and mean to get a filter.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh (as I think I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mentioned) went away, by Liverpool, about a week ago: we had a Letter some days ago indicating that she was safe, was to stay there about a week, and then proceed. She did not take greatly to London; but managed tolerably nevertheless. The day of parting comes: each <hi rend="italic">must</hi> go his own road!</p>
<p>Of all the people I see here John Sterling (the young clergyman) <pb id="pg-08-263" n="08:263"/>is the one I <hi rend="italic">love</hi> most, different as our tempers and life-theories are in all points. He is a frank brotherly all-hoping, most childlike mortal, of very considerable genius; one feels as if he were &#x201C;too good to live;&#x201D; which indeed his bodily constit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> makes one anxious about. He has fixed himself at Bayswater and comes often down to me.</p>
<p>Mill is getting more and more confirmed into a Logician, and Utilitarian of <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> growth. One esteems him exceedingly: but to love <hi rend="italic">him</hi>? It were like loving the 47th of Euclid.<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pythagoras&#x2019; Theorem.</note> In several respects, he is the strangest human creature I have ever in my life seen.</p>
<p>Tomorrow or next day I get a frank, and send your Letter forward to Scotsbrig.</p>
<p>good night dear Jack! I need not seal <foreign><hi rend="italic">bis Morgen</hi></foreign> [till Morning].</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Tuesday morning.</hi>&#x2014; I feel stronger, as I expected, this morning; and fully as well as usual. To work now; with fair prospects! Jane was to write you a P.S.; but was so <foreign><hi rend="italic">vertieft</hi></foreign> [absorbed] in Italian at the moment that she had to put it off till &#x201C;the morrow&#x201D;; and now there is no room, except for her love.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>For the last ten days I have daily (or rather <hi rend="italic">nightly,</hi> for I attempt <hi rend="italic">working</hi> usually thro&#x2019; the day) meditated writing you a word along with this Letter of the Doctor&#x2019;s; but always some mischance or other has come in the way; and my &#x201C;good resolution&#x201D; remains one of those things which, a stern Proverb says, the Place of Darkness is &#x201C;paved with&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300112-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:58</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1830-01-12">12 Jan. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> To lift it out of that frightful condition, into the rank of a &#x201C;good action,&#x201D; I take pen this morning before attempting anything <hi rend="italic">else:</hi> my state of mind, or rather of body, renders me unfit for work at any rate this day: biliousness, blue-pill &#x26;c &#x26;c; so let the duty which <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be done have fulfilment, and the poor unhappy <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> lie over till fitter hours.</p>
<p>We received the Frank, the German Coach-parcel, both of them the day before yesterday: a poorish pennyworth as it proved, but the best the day would bring. The frank is from a Painter I once saw in <pb id="pg-08-264" n="08:264"/>Dumfries for some fifteen minutes, in the midst of a heap of hideous Portraits, of David Hannay,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310327-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:256</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-03-27">27 March 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> Galloway <foreign>Lairds</foreign> and such like; who now wishes me to aid and assist in setting him up here in London. Alas, except by good wishes, due indiscriminately to all the Sons of Adam, I do not in the least see how I can aid and assist this pourtraying [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Mr Lewis<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> (I think he calls himself); or indeed what I am to do or say for him that were much more judicious than simple <hi rend="italic">nothing at all</hi>.

However, he seems a good man, with good purposes; one can wish him <hi rend="italic">good speed</hi> by and by. These <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazines</hi> seem to be a very troublesome thing.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps in connection with charges for postage.</note> I think I may promise that except perhaps one other you shall not be plagued with them again: the very first time I go so far into Town, it is among my obligations to speak to Fraser with emphasis on the subject. And so let us rejoice that it is over, all that shovelful of rubbish swept into the dust-box; and no bones broken. It is not at all likely that any more German Manuscripts will visit you: but if any do, let them lie till you have given me warning; perhaps they will not need forwarding at all, or at any rate I can usually get a frank for doing it.</p>
<p>Lastly the Newspaper has come, not an hour ago; and we have, with considerable endeavour<supplied>[,]</supplied> even made out the sympathetic writing! Pity that there are no news from Scotsbrig about poor Jenny.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sick, as explained later in the letter.</note> but what can we do except keep waiting and hoping. Pray thank your assiduous punctual James for all the pains he has taken: I will owe him as much when his turn comes my way. One other thing I have to request: that he or you, or both, will take paper and plain copperas-gallnut <hi rend="italic">black</hi> ink, and by post write us a most full Letter. There is no satisfaction in anything else; and no other hand, belonging to the Brotherhood, is to be depended on for that. Pray suggest to James (if the little <foreign>Totum</foreign> [Toddler] of an <hi rend="italic">Alick</hi> be too squally) that <hi rend="italic">any</hi> quiet evening will accomplish the object; will be grateful and useful <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> if so spent, and to himself not unprofitable. One gets very uncomfortable in the middle of such entire silence: nothing but black-bile <pb id="pg-08-265" n="08:265"/>and blue-pill to guide your imagination, all goes to sixes and sevens with it; becomes a void darkness; a Chaos, or (as the Terregles<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parish in Kirkcudbrightshire, west of Dumfries.</note> Schoolmaster more poetically called it) even a &#x201C;Tchaw-os&#x201D;! Be such consummation far from us!</p>
<p>Almost the only <hi rend="italic">business</hi> I had to write of was one of the smallest; directions about a Parcel which you will very soon received [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] thro&#x2019; the hands of Mrs Welsh. It contains a pair of boots, for which the former were exchanged (you will know for whom <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are intended); a Book, of great size, meant for my Mother&#x2019;s winter-reading; certain pairs of gloves (poor <foreign><hi rend="italic">scraes</hi></foreign> [shriveled objects] as they are), of which the white-leather pair is for my Mother also, and the other pairs are for Sisters and Sisters-in-law indiscriminately, a pair for each: do you take the first pair, and send the rest all on to Scotsbrig with &#x201C;specifications.&#x201D; This is all.&#x2014; Mrs Welsh left us a fortnight ago, for Liverpool; intending to stay there ten days, and then forward by sea or land as the weather and circumstances might direct. A Newspaper, this day, indicates that she is still at Liverpool; tho&#x2019; whether setting out or farther postponing it, the words &#x201C;still in the wind,&#x201D; which she has <hi rend="italic">un</hi>sympathetically, most palpably written on the margin, do not too clearly indicate. It seems probable that you will see her in passing, or hear after as new-arrived, in no great length of time. She <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> all manner of things in London, and for the rest held herself very quiet; but did not seem to get much good of our Babylon. No wonder at all! It is a place in which no man&#x2019;s head or heart can, otherwise than by effort, and as a gracious exception and favour of Heaven, have any calmness. O the sputtering, crackling, everlasting mad-spinning whirlygig that it is! One closes his eyes on it, many a time, and says: Go then, and whirl and spin, to Tophet,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Symbolising a place of idolatrous sacrifice; cf. 2 Kings 23:10.</note> since thou wilt!</p>
<p>My paper is fast fading, and nothing communicated yet about what we are doing here ourselves. In fact, there is not much to communicate. Old acquaintances are mostly come back for the winter, old circumstances getting themselves arranged on the former footing. Jane is, on the whole, very considerably improved from the date of my quitting her last, when indeed she was weaklier than I had for long seen her. She is not strong today, being just risen from a two-days headache: she had a purpose of writing something in return for your Note; but, I doubt, will hardly make it out this time. Our new Annan Servant goes on rattlingly, a brisk uncomplaining, unhesitating <foreign>lass</foreign>; <pb id="pg-08-266" n="08:266"/>we hope she will rattle away there, astonishing the natives with her pure Annandale <hi rend="italic">breadth</hi> of utterance; and for us, cooking the morsel that is needful, and sweeping the daily product of dust in this dusty confusion of a world, without unnecessary disturbance. It will be a great and almost blessed deliverance, in comparison. She is well herself and hearty; but longs much to hear from her friends now; this you can impart to them, if you have opportunity. As to myself I have really been but in a <foreign>feckless</foreign> sort of state these last two or three weeks; sitting at my Desk once more, but with a degree of helpless ineffectuality that might surprise one. The <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> is not right within, nor the heart; nor is the world right without. Little would tempt me to fling that thrice unfortunate Book of mine, even at this advanced stage of it, <hi rend="italic">cleverly</hi> into the fire, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> have done with it. However I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> take that rash method; I, as you have heard, <hi rend="italic">take a blue pill</hi> rather, and wait for better days. Like the man I one night heard on Leith Walk: a drunk individual whom he met growled out indignantly, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Go</hi> to H&#x2014;, sir!&#x201D;&#x2014;to which the other, in a frank historical tone, replied, &#x201C;G&#x2014;, I&#x2019;m gawn to <hi rend="italic">Leith&#x201D;;</hi>&#x2014;and have not convenience for the other expedition just now! Let not me be less judicious. In fact, I have scrawled and <foreign><hi rend="italic">glarred</hi></foreign> [daubed] some portion of my poor Book but brought nothing whatever out in a clean shape yet. It is what James would call &#x201C;laying it,&#x201D; perhaps the other finer parts of the process will follow in due course. I must be quiet, quiet: it is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">canny</hi></foreign> [cautious] way of working, not the right-forward main-force way, that will serve me in this case. The Book, be it worth nothing or worth something, shall, if Heaven please, be finished. After which it seems possible a radical reform, at any rate a radical change, in my figure of life may follow. I am grown or fast growing entirely wearied of much; especially of this perpetual pining in sickliness, i<supplied>[n]</supplied> the mean painful enchantment (for it is very much that) of nameless woe and dispiritment. Nameless and needless; for I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> bound to it: one can live otherwise than by ink (and <hi rend="italic">poison</hi> as it proves); otherwise, were it even by breaking stones on the highway. I believe myself to have at bottom a very <hi rend="italic">healthy</hi> frame of body, for one so sensitive; and soon sur<supplied>[ely]</supplied> or never I ought to think of getting in possession of that. Let the whole world sing or say what it will, the course that had led a man into continual <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>-health is a <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> course, a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> Nature herself surely warns him aloud to quit it. The only thing to be prayed for however, i<supplied>[n]</supplied> this matter, is that you <hi rend="italic">keep your temper</hi>. Cheerful heart, and such clearness of eye as is! If one gets <hi rend="italic">enraged,</hi> he flings all topsyturvy; and <hi rend="italic">is,</hi> and produces round him, a mere &#x201C;Ttchaw-os.&#x201D; <pb id="pg-08-267" n="08:267"/>Consider, on the other hand, that &#x201C;smallest of Barley-men&#x201D;;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Birlieman or Barleyman estimated the value of the crops, hence was an arbiter of local disputes. Perhaps Carlyle sees &#x201C;the smallest of Barley-men&#x201D; as humble in contrast to Solomon, yet practical.</note> how he speculates not, neither does he inquire: yet Solomon in all his wisdom and might said, &#x201C;Vanity of Vanities&#x201D;;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 1:2, but not said by Solomon.</note> and <hi rend="italic">he,</hi> purchasing a cask of small ale, thinks it nourishing liquor.&#x2014; The truth is, dear Jean<supplied>[,]</supplied> as thou seest, I am fit for nothing this day but <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> croaking: and had not this Letter been to do might as well have lain dormant, and not attempted doing of any kind.</p>
<p>We shall look very anxiously for news from Scotsbrig and you. Jenny seemed but in a weak way all the time I was there: perhaps this violent sorethroat bringing the business to a head, may leave her better than it found her, and be one of those <hi rend="italic">painful blessings</hi> one often experiences here. But we long very much to hear how it is with her. James will probably take this down to Scotsbrig when he goes; I have warned my Mother that it would go out on Wednesday in any case: James by some Newspaper when at Scotsbrig can give us a hint. An <hi rend="italic">interior</hi> wafer, and two or three words in a small hand will bring us most directly to the point. Till, as I said, James and you can<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From this point to &#x201C;amount to the same thing&#x201D; the gaps and words in square brackets are caused by a badly torn MS.</note> &#x2026; write us a long Letter!</p>
<p>It is good news to <supplied>[he]</supplied>ar about the <hi rend="italic">Lasts</hi> <supplied>[bein]</supplied>g in the course of finish. I &#x2026; pair of Bl&#xfc;cher Boots;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Strong leather half boots named after Gebhard Leberecht von Bl&#xfc;cher (<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), Prussian general.</note> wh<supplied>[ich]</supplied> as is too usual, pinch me troublesomely, and would <supplied>[pinch more if]</supplied> I did not take heed. By a <supplied>[si]</supplied>ngular mischance, they are from the very same mould &#x2026; were last year which set me <foreign>hitching</foreign> [hobbling] and <foreign>banning</foreign> [cursing]: the two shoe<hi rend="italic">shops</hi> were far &#x2026; pair of shoes, as I found too clearly, were the <hi rend="italic">same,</hi> in perversity of shape, e &#x2026; weaker leather! They come all from Northampton or such places; and my evil &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">so;</hi> that I should land&#x2014;on my <hi rend="italic">head</hi>. If the judicious chance have complied with &#x2026; -<hi rend="italic">y,</hi> it is well: but if I had it to order again, I should bid him paste four plies of &#x2026; the sole of the foot (the stucco-foot), and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>. At worst, one can nail a bit &#x2026; <supplied>[s]</supplied>ole leather on the bottom of the Last, and it will amount to the same thing. Tell James, however, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to forward the new pair of shoes, till I or he hear of some gratuitous opportunity; only to have them ready when he is satisfied. A <pb id="pg-08-268" n="08:268"/>Coach-parcel, were it never so light, costs 7/2 to this door<supplied>[,]</supplied> too much to risk on it.</p>
<p>Poor Jane can write nothing, only send you her love and regards: she is free of headache today, but all &#x201C;<foreign>daddit abreed</foreign> [shaken to pieces],&#x201D; as she says, and as you may fancy. I must write a small scrap of inquiry to Alick; and then seal and despatch. The answer to Jack&#x2019;s Letter is already over the sea. Tell my dear Mother that so soon as my first Chapter is fairly clean and concluded I will get a frank for her. Give my brotherly affection to all and every of them, not forgetting Thomas your neighbour in the list. Take care of yourselves; and keep the little creature warm.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps Carlyle is confusing his nephews: Thomas was Alexander&#x2019;s son, Alick was Jean&#x2019;s.</note> <closer><salute>Farewell my dear Sister!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>This miserable scrap of paper is barely, if at all, better than nothing; but I cannot let another frank go without at least one word from me: a word to signify articulately in black on white the &#x201C;farewell&#x201D; I had not time to take of you by speech that morning. What you felt as I went whirling away from you, in that dumb hurried manner, I could well feel. By the blessing of the heavenly Powers, we will meet again, and have some speech yet.</p>
<p>All my news are in the sheet already written to Jean, which you <pb id="pg-08-269" n="08:269"/>will see. The thing I had farther to say was a question, best put to yourself: How you are getting on with those farms, and other projects of yours? I will keep flattering myself that you have fallen in with some kind of prospect that way. America is a thing one <foreign><hi rend="italic">scunners</hi></foreign> at [flinches from] terribly; surely poor Scotland is not quite desolate yet. Let us do our best, Boy! In the mean time, one counsel I have to give (and indeed it is the one I have myself, in my own position, to <hi rend="italic">take</hi>): that of being as <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> as were possible; considerably quieter than you are. Do not madden your heart with the thing, let it go which way it will; sit <hi rend="italic">still,</hi> till you have more clearness; the clock-weights of the world are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> rushing madly down, it is only one&#x2019;s own impatient temper that so paints it out to one. I really would like well to hear that you could, many a time, thro&#x2019; these winter days, sit down quietly and <hi rend="italic">do nothing:</hi> read, or, as John advises, take to improvement in spelling and arithmetic. Books I really would counsel: ask Ben Nelson, for instance, whether he cannot get you Stewart&#x2019;s work on America,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Stuart, <hi rend="italic">Three Years in North America,</hi> 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>); see also <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330418-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:372&#x2013;73</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-04-18">18 April 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> and many other works on it, or on other subjects that may interest you? He will do it quite willingly; or you may procure Books elsewhere: and really cannot be better employed than reading them. Of course, neglecting no opportunity of trying for farms; in which I still hope you will find the modest success you seek. But if <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> why then still we are not lost, we will not despair, There is a wide world still; and hearts, that will all help one another. No &#x201C;brattling and brainging at ta weemsie&#x201D; then! &#x201C;Kit what ta deevil ails ta?&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Part of a Canobie coalminer&#x2019;s speech to his Boy &#x2018;Kit,&#x2019; reported by Brother Alick, with true mimetic humour&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note quoted by A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM,</hi> I, 82), meaning &#x201C;No &#x2018;clattering and plunging in your stomach&#x2019; then! &#x2018;Kit what the devil ails you?&#x2019;&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I hope at any rate my dear Brother you will write to me <hi rend="italic">freely,</hi> very soon; and tell me what your speed [progress] is be it better, be it worse.&#x2014; I am somewhat <foreign>feckless</foreign> and bilious, as you will see by Jean&#x2019;s Letter; but not ailing anything other than that.&#x2014; Jack abides at Munich, so far as we can see, thro&#x2019; the winter: perhaps he could not be better than there. The Paper is done: I durst not take a larger bit for overloading the frank. Ja<supplied>[ne is r]</supplied>ather ailing too, unites with me in kind love to all your Ho<supplied>[usehol]</supplied>d &#x26; you. Do not forget the small Jane, the small Tom!&#x2014; Sit composed thro&#x2019; the winter my dear Alick; hopeful, trusting in Heaven and its goodness; and when <hi rend="italic">intolerable</hi> misery overtakes you at any hour, seek within your own <pb id="pg-08-270" n="08:270"/>heart for the cause of it. <closer><salute>God bless you!

<salute>My dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>No Letter could be welcomer than yours, bringing favourable tidings as it did, at the time when we were apprehensive that something was wrong with you. It is the first Letter you have sent us; but must be the beginning of many. Do not spare us with Letters: it will improve your handwriting, and be everyway a good exercise for yourself, were there nothing more; and to us always, the smallest contribution of news will be welcome as flowers in May. Just do as you have begun doing: write down whatsoever comes readiest to hand; not minding whether it be well-worded or ill-worded; understanding only, with clear assurance, that the minutest piece of intelligence you convey from those Two Upper Rooms, in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> kind of words whatever, will be welcomer than all rhetoric could make anything else.</p>
<p>It does not seem as if that cold had completely left you yet: you must be very careful about it; avoid damp, cold feet, exposure to sunrise or sunset; above all things, take care of derangements in the stomach, for it all begins there.&#x2014; We have had a new Letter from Dumfries since you wrote; which however does not bring any very minute intelligence of recent date from Scotsbrig: we take the comfort it suggests, that if anything had been gone far out of joint there, they would have heard it, and told us.&#x2014; Alick wrote a part of that sheet; and his hand was welcome to us, as he may know. Pray thank him for me, as well as James and Jean, till I get time to do it myself.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1835-12-14">14 Dec.</date>, written by James and Jean Aitken, and Alick.</note> What that Bacon-affair may turn to one cannot conjecture: no doubt, it is natural to grasp eagerly for employment, and <hi rend="italic">any</hi>thing is better in several senses than <hi rend="italic">no</hi>thing; we must hope that good will come of it. So far as I understand, it is better on the face of it than Cattle-jobbing; which indeed seems to be of all extant trades the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> every way. I grieve to learn that there is small outlook for farming; <pb id="pg-08-271" n="08:271"/>yet it is what I expected.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had said that he was in Dumfries &#x201C;to attend the pork-market, for you must know that I have commenced that line of business about a fortnight ago&#x2014;.&#x201D; He had taken up baconcuring and by <date when="1836-06-00">June 1836</date> calculated &#x201C;on having gained 50&#xa3;.&#x201D; (JAC to TC, <date when="1836-06-15">15 June 1836</date>). On farms he said, &#x201C;the Gullielands is let to Dockray the hatter for more than &#xa3;20 too much I think. the Orchard is now in the market but I have little hope of it.&#x201D;</note> The German Proverb says, &#x201C;There are remedies for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things but Death&#x201D;; a very true Proverb. We must wait with our eyes open; do nothing rashly, do all things bravely patiently.</p>
<p>I have not forgotten your new <hi rend="italic">Coal-Box;</hi> which I welcome heartily into that corner. It is pity Alick has not yet got up the chimney-cann! Tell him from me that the sooner it is done the <hi rend="italic">better;</hi> that it will grow no easier at all to do by never so much waiting. Also mention again in your next Letter whether it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> done.</p>
<p>As for me the principal news is that I have got another Chapter of that weary Book finished, better or worse. I felt rather <foreign>feckless</foreign>, dispirited, confused: but the thing went off when I roused myself; I found with joy that I could still go along writing as of old. A long task is still to do; but it is all <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> work now; no writing of <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> stuff, which latter surely is the miserablest of all human trades, enough to break the heart of a man. I am in better health than I was; and will go on <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;</hi><foreign><hi rend="italic">cannily</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">,&#x201D;</hi> well remembering John Richie&#x2019;s admonition: &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">slower</hi> thou rides&#x201D; &#x26;c.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Thou may depend on&#x2019;t, the <hi rend="italic">slower</hi> thou rides the <hi rend="italic">quicker</hi> thou&#x2019;ll get to thy journey&#x2019;s end&#x2019; (this to a man riding a mere skeleton of a horse, likely to die if urged on)&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> It is in my favour too this fine hard weather we have: a ringing black frost all round; I saw the people today skating on the pond of St James&#x2019;s Park, the nose of all persons <hi rend="italic">blue,</hi> gardeners &#x26;c thrown out of work will soon be begging &#x201C;Pity the poor <hi rend="italic">froze</hi>-in Garden<hi rend="italic">ers</hi>!&#x2019;&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361229-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date></ref>.</note> It is winter fairly.

<salute>My dear Mother</salute>
<p>You are to look upon it as the most positive proof of my regard that I write to you in my present circumstances; that is to say with the blood all frozen in my veins, and my brains turned to a solid mass of ice, for such has for several days been the too cruel lot of your poor little daughter in law at Lunnon; the general lot indeed of all Lunnon so far I can observe. When the Frost <hi rend="italic">comes</hi> here, <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;it comes&#x201D;</hi> as the woman said with the four eggs.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;When I come, I come,&#x2019; laying down her gift of four eggs&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> and it seems to be somehow more difficult to guard against it than elsewhere for all the world immediately takes to coughing and blowing its nose with a fury quite appalling. The noise thus created destroys the suffering remnant<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Suffering remnant,&#x2019; so the Cameronians called themselves in Claverhouse&#x2019;s time&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> of senses spared by the cold and makes the writing of a letter or any other employment in which thought is concerned seem almost a tempting of Providence. Nevertheless I am here to tell you that we are still in the land of the living,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 28:13.</note> and thinking of you all <pb id="pg-08-273" n="08:273"/>from yourself the head of the nation down to that very least and fattest child, who I hope will continue to grow fatter and fatter till I come to see it with my own eyes&#x2014; I count this fatness a good omen for the whole family! it betokens goodnature which is a quality too rare among us. Those <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;long sprawling ill puttogether&#x201D;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;A lang, sprawling, ill-put-together thing,&#x2019; such had been my mother&#x2019;s definit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to her, of me as a nurseling&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> children give early promise of being <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>gy</foreign> ill to deal wi.&#x201D;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Thou&#x2019;s <foreign>gey</foreign> (pretty, pronounced <hi rend="italic">gyei</hi>) ill to deal wi&#x2019;;&#x2019; Mother&#x2019;s allocut<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to me once, in some unreasonable moment of mine&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note></p>
<p>That one of them who is fallen to my share conducts himself pretty peac<supplied>[e]</supplied>ably at present, writing only in the forenoons. He has finished a chapter much to my satisfaction, and the poor book begins to hold up its head again.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec.</date>): &#x201C;Four days ago, finished the 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> Chapter V.II (named &#x2018;Nancy&#x2019;); very indifferent; questionable, above all, in respect of its relation to the rest, and whether it should have been that way, or even <hi rend="italic">been</hi>. Cannot help it.&#x2014; Providence again is leading me, thro&#x2019; dark burning hideous ways, towards new heights and developments. &#x2026; What shall my next Chapter be? <hi rend="italic">Varennes; Day of Poinards, Mirabeau?</hi> Will behove me to act forthwith about deciding. Varennes most likely; the space being limited. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Satis!</hi></foreign>&#x201D;</note> Our situation is further improved by the introduction of Ann Cook into the establishment instead of the distracted Roman Catholics and distracted protestants who preceded her. She seems an assiduous kindly honest and thrifty creature, and will learn to do all I want with her quite easily. For the rest, she amuses me every hour of the day with her perfect incomprehension of every thing like ceremony. I was helping her to wring a sheet one day, while she had the cut finger and she told me very flatly it was &#x201C;clean aboon my fit&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(Ability)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014; &#x201C;I should get at it by practice&#x201D; said I &#x201C;for weaker people than <supplied>[I]</supplied> have wrung sheets&#x2014;&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;May be sae,&#x201D;</hi> returned she very cool<supplied>[l]</supplied>y, <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;but I <foreign>ken</foreign> na where yeel find ony weaker; for a weaklier like cretur I never saw in a my life.&#x201D;</hi> Another time when Carlyle had been off his sleep for a night or two; she came to me at bedtime to ask&#x2014;&#x201C;if Mr. Carlyle bees ony uneasy thro the <foreign>nicht</foreign>, and&#x2019;s gaan <foreign><hi rend="italic">staiveren</hi></foreign><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(Stumbling)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> aboot the hoose wull ye bid him gee us a cry<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(Awaken us)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> at five i&#x2019; the morning&#x201D;! We may infer however that she is getting more civilisation from the entire change in her ideas respecting the handsome Italian Count<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Count Pepoli, Bologna exile &#x26; dilettante, a very pretty man&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> for instead of calling him <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;a <foreign>fleysome</foreign></hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(Fright-some)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> <hi rend="italic">body&#x201D;</hi> any longer she is of opinion that he is <supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied>a real fine man and nain that comes can <pb id="pg-08-274" n="08:274"/>ever <supplied>[be]</supplied> named in ae day wi him,&#x201D; nay I notice that she puts on a certain net cap with a most peculiar knot of ribbands every time she knows of his coming. The reward of which act, is a <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;I weesh you gooday&#x201D;</hi> when she lets him out. So much for poor Ann who I hope will long continue to flourish in the land. My Mother is still in Liverpool and talks now of remaining till after newyearsday&#x2014;how much longer will depend on various chances apparently&#x2014; If she <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be comfortable there it is better she stays at this dead season of the year. Still better could she have remained in comfort with us. but she did not take to London at all&#x2014;nobody seemed to please her except Count Pepoli with whom she could not interchange a word in any language of articulate speaking men&#x2014;and that was perhaps the reason&#x2014; I am much better off this winter for society than I was last&#x2014;Mrs Sterling<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sterling&#x2019;s mother, Hester Sterling.</note> makes the greatest possible change for me. She is so good so sincerely and unvaryingly kind that I feel to her as to a third Mother. Whenever I have blue devils I need but put on my bonnet and run off to her and the smile in her eyes restores me to instant good humour&#x2014; Her Husband would go thro&#x2019; fire and water for me and if there were a third worse element would go thro that also&#x2014;the son is devoted to Carlyle and makes him a real friend which among all his various intimate acquaintances and wellwishers he cannot be said ever to have had before&#x2014;this family then is a great blessing to us. And so had been my study of Italian which has helped me thro many dullish hours. I never feel any thing like youth about except when I am learning something, and when I am turning over my Italian dictionar<supplied>[y]</supplied> I could fancy myself thirteen&#x2014;whether there be any good in fancying oneself thirteen after one is turned of thirty I leave your charity to determine.</p>

<p>Mrs Welsh came to us in the last days of <date when="1835-08-00">Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi></date>,&#x2014;by an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Steamer:&#x2014; I was waiting at the St Katherine Dock, in a bright afternoon; pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> meeting, pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> voyage up the river in our wherry; and such a welcome here at home as may be fancied. Ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the end of the next month, I had finished my <hi rend="italic">Burnt Ms.;</hi> and seem then to have run for Scotsbrig, and been there perhaps 3 weeks (scarcely a detail of it now clear to me), in <date when="1835-10-00">Oct</date> following; I was sickly of body and mind, <pb id="pg-08-276" n="08:276"/>felt heavy-laden, and with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> any hope but the &#x201C;desperate&#x201D; kind, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I always did hold fast. Our Irish Cath<hi rend="italic">c</hi> housemaid proved a mutinous Irish Savage (had a fixed persuasion, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> notice, that our poor House and we had been made for <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> and gone awry in the process): one ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> while all seated for supper Mrs Welsh, Eliza Miles &#x26; we Two, the indign<hi rend="italic">t</hi> savage jingling down her plates as if she had been playing coits, was instantaneously dismissed by me (&#x201C;To y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> room at once; wages tomorrow morning; disappear!&#x201D;)&#x2014;so that the bringing of a Scotch Servant was one of <supplied>[my]</supplied> express errands. &#x2018;Ann Cook,&#x2019; accordingly, &#x26; the journey with her, by Steamer from Annan, by &#x201C;Umpire Coach&#x201D; from L<hi rend="italic">rpool,</hi> some 40 or 50 hours, all in a piece, is dismally memorable! Breakfast at Newport Pagnell<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, south of Northampton on the coach route from Liverpool to London.</note> (I had given Ann the inside place, night being cold &#x26; wet) awkw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hungry Ann w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hardly even eat, till bidden and directed by me, landing in Holborn, half-dead, bright Sunday aft<hi rend="italic">rnoon,</hi> amid a crowd of porters, cabmen, hungry officials, some 7 or 10 of them, ravenous for sixpences &#x26; shillings, till at length I shut the cab-door, &#x201C;To no person will I pay anything more at this time!&#x201D;&#x2014;and drove off, amid a gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> laugh, not ill-humoured, from the recognising miscellany. Drive home, surrounded by luggage, and with Ann for company, seemed endless. I landed at this door, in a state of misery, more like mad than sane:&#x2014;but my Darling was in the lobby; saw at a glance how it was; and almost with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> speaking bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me to my room, and with me a big glass, almost goblet, of the best Sherry, &#x201C;Drink that, Dear, at a draught!&#x201D; Never in my life had I such a medicine. Shaved, washed, got into clean clothes, I step<hi rend="italic">t</hi> down quite new-made, &#x26; thanking Heaven for such a Doctor.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh went away a few weeks after, to Liv<hi rend="italic">rpl</hi> to her Brother John&#x2019;s there,&#x2014;fav<hi rend="italic">te</hi> [favorite] and now only Br<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> a brave and gener<hi rend="italic">s</hi> [generous] man much liked by all of us.&#x2014;</p>
<p>John Sterling had turned up in the early part of this year: John Sterling, and with him all the Sterl<hi rend="italic">gs;</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was an immense acquisit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to us for the ten years that followed.

<p>That &#x2018;sore foot of Xmas last,&#x2019; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has never otherwise been forgotten by me, now dates itself.

<p><salute>My Dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute> I walked over to Charles Buller today, and got this frank, which will be lying ready for you on Saturday, or whensoever, after that, you call. It was my promise that I would drop you a word so soon as anything <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> came upon the sheets of the Book; and a little Chapter being got into that state, I keep my word. John&#x2019;s Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Munich, <date when="1835-12-08">8 Dec.</date></note> spick-and-span new the other day, and full of nothing but welcome tidings, is so much <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> bargain. You will find him very well; better off, I think, than any other of us whatsoever at this date; and fixed there till <date when="1836-04-00">April</date>, when we may again cherish the hope of seeing him, should all go well. He has even Practice, it would seem, and has made 420 <hi rend="italic">francs</hi> (or Ten-pences) by that, about &#xa3;20, better very considerably than making nothing. I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> written to him; and my Letter would be in his hands some two days after his own came off.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John complains in his letter of not having received one from Carlyle recently. He gives news of the d&#x2019;Eichthal family: &#x201C;Has Charles d&#x2019;Eichthal been to see you yet? I wrote a little postscript in one of his mother&#x2019;s letters to request him to do so. Jane will find him a tolerable chess player. The whole family are exceedingly kind to me here. I have a standing invitation to their Loge in the theatre, and to dine with them whenever I have time to spare.&#x201D;</note> I think I shall wait now, having nothing that presses to tell him, till I hear again.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-278" n="08:278"/>I got your three words, my dear Mother; and was right glad of them, in the absence of more. I assure you, I will be &#x201C;<foreign>canny</foreign>&#x201D;; nay I must, for a little overwork hurts me, and is found on the very morrow to be quite the contrary of <hi rend="italic">gain</hi>. I have many a rebellious troublesome thought in me (proceeding not a little from ill-health of body); but I deal with them, as I best can, and get them kicked out. Pride! Pride! as I often say. It lies deep in me; deep, deep, and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be beaten out, were it with many stripes. If this Book were done, I feel all but quite clear for giving up Literature as a [<supplied>trade</supplied>&#x2014;blur on page] <hi rend="italic">whatsoever</hi> other I fall to. But for the present all this is neither one thing nor another to me. On, on with thy work! that is the one commandment; sufficient for the day!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 6:34.</note>&#x2014; I see many good people here; and have indeed many a blessing, were I in the mood to make right use of them. The Young Clergyman John Sterling comes very much about me; and proves by far the loveablest man I have met for many a year. His speech always enlivens me; shortens the long walks we sometimes take. There is no day almost but I walk: the Streets, even when there is none with me, are amusing to look on, one does not readily weary.&#x2014; I do not go much <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;out&#x201D;;</hi> never to dinner when I can help it. Tea, again, suits me well enough: you take <hi rend="italic">your tea at home,</hi> then fare out about seven or eight O&#x2019;clock, drink one other cup of <hi rend="italic">jute</hi> [weak tea], have some talk, often very rational and pleasant, and come home unharmed. I saw the Bullers that way one night; also Mill lately (who has been ill of some kind of fever); John Sterling with whom I saw that Evangelist the good Mr Dunn; &#x26;c &#x26;c. So passes the day in labour, the evening in some sort of amusement or light employment.&#x2014; There is a Paper in the last North American Review, headed &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle&#x201D;; which treats of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh:</hi> it is extracts mostly; good-natured, rather stupid: you will see it by and by. The man says, if I will come to America, I shall be sure of a welcome &#x26;c:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Alexander H. Everett and the review, see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-TC-GRI-01">TC to <sic>GR</sic><corr>GRI</corr>, [ca. <date when="1835-08-00">Aug.</date>]</ref>. Carlyle printed a long extract from the review under &#x201C;Testimonies of Authors&#x201D; in the first British book edition of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> (London, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), pp. vi&#x2013;ix; and he wrote of it in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, about this time, that it was &#x201C;very insignificant; say inane.&#x201D;</note> America we will leave as the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> shift; so long as the bowls will roll here at all in a tolerable way, I will keep on this side the water. It is a queer thing writing, in these days: you send a written sheet away from Craigenputtoch, and the answer to it comes back by and by over the Atlantic Ocean. They seem very good sort of people these Yankees,&#x2014;at least to me.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-279" n="08:279"/>Dear Mother, how do you <hi rend="italic">fend</hi> in this hard weather, these short days? Do you keep a rousing fire from the new Coal-box? Mrs Welsh has the Book for you. The days will always be growing longer after <hi rend="italic">this;</hi>&#x2014;and times generally, never doubt it, will alter and even mend! We have the whole world to turn ourselves in; and it is the Almighty&#x2019;s world.&#x2014; It will be another new year before you hear from me again. May the worst of our years be over! Good be with you and all of us; thro&#x2019; this coming year,&#x2014;thro&#x2019; the endless Eternity which it brings us a step nearer.&#x2014; You must very kindly remember me to Grahame when you meet him, and say I will write, were I farther on, a little. My respects to that speechless Infant, brotherly wishes to his father and mother. Jenny is charged with my messages to Alick. Do not forget Mary and her household: she can also tell Ann Cook&#x2019;s people that the <foreign>lassie</foreign> is well; hardy as a Highlander, full of assiduity, good nature, and wild Annandale savagery, which causes the Cockney mind here to pause astonished. Broader Scotch was never spoken or thought by any mortal in this Metropolitan City. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother. Yours wholly,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesterday a Gentleman, sympathizing with the late mischance of the London Journal,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There is no mention in the last issue, no. 91, <date when="1835-12-26">26 Dec. 1835</date>, of an impending closure, as Hunt explained to Thomas Weller on <date when="1836-01-16">16 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi> was discontinued with an abruptness almost as surprising to myself as to you, owing to some mysteries of partnership which I cannot explain; and I could not take leave of my readers &#x2026;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence of Leigh Hunt,</hi> ed. Thornton Hunt [London, <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>], I, 311). Later Hunt wrote that &#x201C;the note which it had struck was of too aesthetical a nature for cheap readers in those days&#x201D; though most of the essays were later &#x201C;accepted by the public. &#x2026; But the reputation, as usual, was too late for the profit&#x201D; (Hunt, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi>, ed. J. E. Morpurgo [London, <date when="1949-00-00">1949</date>], p. 428).</note> asked me, whether I thought I could, without offense to your feelings, hand you the inclosed little Paper on the part of a Nameless Friend?

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am sure the full time for a Letter to you has come and gone since I wrote last; and, tho&#x2019; there is nothing particular to be treated of, another Letter will be welcome. I must not let &#x201C;want of time&#x201D; be an excuse any longer; but write this night; flinging all to the right and left till I have done it.</p>
<p>Jenny,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sent from Manchester by Robert Hanning to Janet at Scotsbrig, who had then sent it on to London.</note> or more probably Mary, sent me a Manchester Newspaper last week with the Notice that you had heard from Jack, and that with you and him all was well: for which brief notice, as for a most welcome <pb id="pg-08-281" n="08:281"/>one, I pray you thank the sender. It is good, compared with none at all! Yet I hope soon to hear it more specifically, and at large. Jack has not written to me since the Letter you got; nor have I to him; waiting always till I heard from him <hi rend="italic">again</hi> (for a Letter of mine was on the road when he wrote last), that so our Correspondence might get <hi rend="italic">clear</hi>, and delivered from what I call the <hi rend="italic">overlapping</hi> impediment, that is, one Letter always having to be written and despatched before the answer to the last has come. I feel pretty sure, tho&#x2019; the Newspaper said nothing of it, that Jack would desire me to write <hi rend="italic">now</hi> forthwith; and I accordingly shall do it, without waiting for instruction from you, or for any other prompting or furtherance: the night after tomorrow is the time I appoint for that duty. If indeed a Letter from Scotsbrig should arrive in the interim, it would be a great accession! But I fear there is little likelihood of that. Jack, as I conjecture, is going on in the old very tolerable way at Munich; not unpleasantly for the meantime, and with the hope of seeing us all in <date when="1836-04-00">April</date>, which hope we too can indulge. Let us be thankful; that we are all struggling on, better or worse, in a reasonable course; that prosperity shines on any of us, and adversity has yet beaten none of us down.</p>
<p>As for myself, I have nothing to relate except that I travel forward in my task, daily by little and little; at a frightfully slow rate, yet never absolutely lying down. The Fable says, The Hare, swiftest of animals, set out to run a race with the Tortoise, which is the slowest: Hare, after a while, looking over his shoulder, saw Tortoise at such an immeasurable distance that he thought it was of no use running, he might sport a little, or even go to sleep; he slept accordingly; and awoke to see what crawling, continual perseverant crawling, had done: the Tortoise was within few yards of the goal; the Hare <foreign><hi rend="italic">spanged</hi></foreign> [leaped] and jumped, but could not get in <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, only <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, and had lost like a fool!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aesop&#x2019;s fable on &#x201C;The Hare and the Tortoise.&#x201D;</note> Thus it is with the perseverant man. Or as you said when shearing that time, &#x201C;Do never so little, it will not jump in again.&#x201D;&#x2014; On the whole, however, I have no reason to be very sour with myself: I have a Second Chapter done off; and a Third or perhaps a Third and Fourth mostly lying out on the paper, needing only to be polished off more or less. I am also very quiet, and content; in general almost happy; quite careless what becomes of me, so I had done with this Task. It was a Task I <hi rend="italic">could do;</hi> I, even I: no crossness of circumstances, unfriendliness of things or men could hinder me <pb id="pg-08-282" n="08:282"/>from doing it, but I finished it off in the name of Heaven! This is what I will say, one day; and look again, with what faith I can, to my Great Taskmaster, as to what is <hi rend="italic">next</hi> to be done. The Book will be a very <hi rend="italic">queer</hi> one; and blessed to me beyond measure,&#x2014;were it in this only, that I shall have no more to do with it.</p>
<p>All the rest of London goes as it was wont; I heeding it comparatively little. The great grinding roar of it discomposes not my ear, as I walk thro it; I see much to pity, something to love; almost nothing I can be at the trouble to hate. John Mill has had a fever of some kind, and is still very weakly: I see little of him for long, as he cannot come out at nights: his Father also is confined all winter with illness;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1836-01-09">9 Jan.</date> Mill had written to Sarah Austin about a slight illness from which he was &#x201C;by no means completely reestablished. My father has had no returns of unfavourable symptoms for many weeks now, but his recovery is very slow&#x201D; (Mineka, XII, 291&#x2013;92). James Mill was suffering his last illness and died on <date when="1836-06-23">23 June</date>. Mill continued unwell; in <date when="1836-04-00">April</date> he was ordered to Brighton to recuperate; and in <date when="1836-07-00">July</date> he took three months&#x2019; leave from India House to travel on the continent for his health.</note> there have been very many people sick. I wonder often how it is with you at Scotsbrig in that respect: I fear it has been very boisterous and rigorous upon you; but you never complain. Spring will be here by and by, and brighter sun. It is our pleasantest season in London: indeed I fear nothing here in the shape of weather, if it be not the scorching of such a summer as our last was.&#x2014; I see all my other old good friends, kind to me as ever. Tomorrow we are to dine with Mr Dunn,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Rev. James Dunn, see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June 1835</date></ref>.</note> that worthiest of Irish Clergymen: he is a good man, and does me good; his very face is a lesson of patient suffrance, of peace and goodwill towards men. I also see the Wilsons;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane and Thomas Wilson, sister and brother.</note> who have now got back from Paris. Various others: but somewhat oftener than any I walk with John Sterling, debating much with the man, loving him for his young hope, some ten years younger than mine. All these people are partial blessings to me: pleasant to look after, when one has done with his days work, and goes out &#x201C;at two o&#x2019;clock.&#x201D; On the other hand, it is also pleasant enough to be left quite quiet with your own thoughts and a Book in the evening: I often enjoy myself very handsomely that way. Men cannot help me much, men cannot hinder me much,&#x2014;to get on with my poor French Revolution, which is the grand thing at present!&#x2014; Jane has had a cold, and has often breakfasted in bed in the frosts; but otherwise she has been pretty well, and indeed is now done with that complaint too; and sits writing, at <pb id="pg-08-283" n="08:283"/>this moment, behind me, at her own table and desk; busy with a short French Translation I got for her to do. Whether she will &#x201C;make three guineas by it,&#x201D; or not, is still a kind of problem; but it has been useful otherwise of itself.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced, but possibly a translation of some work by an unidentified Landolphe, apparently a Swiss or French writer; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360302-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1836-03-02">2 March</date></ref>.</note> She has made the <hi rend="italic">tartan:</hi> into what think you? No dressing-gown, but a Gown proper; with black silk sleeves (large as bushel-sacks), and wears it daily,&#x2014;very dashing I assure you.&#x2014;&#x2014; I mentioned on a Newspaper that the Barrels had come, &#x201C;just the night before.&#x201D; Perhaps a hundred times, when any waggon wheels stopped near us, we had thought, There now at last, there they are!&#x2014;till finally so often disappointed we had almost renounced hope of our poor Barrels, so that their actual arrival was a surprise. The carriage from Whitehaven to London Docks was some 11/; from the Docks hither&#x2014;some additional 9/; a pound all but twopence (I think) in all. Nothing was spoiled, nothing wrong: the Customhouse beagles had broken up both, to see that there was nothing contraband; they had taken the <hi rend="italic">bottom</hi> too, the cunning dogs; but coming to the Hams and their wrappage, which were unwilling to come out that way, they had most luckily <hi rend="italic">stopt;</hi> had they gone an inch farther, there lay the <hi rend="italic">whisky;</hi> and the whole had been condemned with penalties!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From <date when="1736-00-00">1736</date> to <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date> England had a higher tax on spirits than Scotland, hence any whisky imported not only had to pay tax to bring it into line with this but after <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date> had to pay extra in an attempt by English distillers to limit imports from Scotland. Alick&#x2019;s whisky was either legally taxed in Scotland and smuggled to avoid the import tax, or was part of the resurgence of illicit whisky distilling provoked by the higher taxes of <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>. Whisky from an illicit still was often superior in quality, so Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;rare stuff&#x201D; may well have avoided taxation entirely.</note> We drew off the Graybeard<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Earthenware pitcher with a handle at one side and a spout at the other; named from the old man&#x2019;s face with a long beard which sometimes formed the spout.</note> however, and drank Alick&#x2019;s health in it, rare stuff as it is: but never more may liquor travel with such risk. On the whole, I think we will not plague you again with Barrels and stuff sent hither. One can get all here to buy; if it be not the oatmeal, and I found I could sup on arrow-root and milk almost as well. This year, however, we eat Scotsbrig potatoes to dinner; eat Annan Ham to breakfast; which is curious enough. Isabella&#x2019;s Cheese, so far as the eye can judge, had stood its journey, to Belfast and round the Land&#x2019;s End, very well. The sides of it were <hi rend="italic">dimpled</hi> all over with pressure of potatoes; but the skin was unbroken: it is scraped clean, and lies high and dry, on a bra<supplied>[c]</supplied>ket up stairs, seasoning. We hope to eat it, <pb id="pg-08-284" n="08:284"/>and honour the sisterly maker, in due time.&#x2014; I must also tell you a word about the housemaid Ann; who is now writing a morsel of Letter to go by this to her Mother. The <foreign>lass</foreign> is hardy, cheerful, unwearied; rough and ready! No servant we have ever had gets me breakfast so soon prepared in the mornings: I usually sit down at eight o&#x2019;clock,&#x2014;such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">dadding hizzy</hi></foreign> [speedy girl] is this Ann, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">stours</hi></foreign> [bustles] along,&#x2014;not of course in the most particular way. We have great cause to think her a lucky change against London women; and will very cheerfully let her <foreign><hi rend="italic">dadd</hi></foreign> [dash] about there with ready hand and will.&#x2014; I said you would get the Letter sent down before many days.</p>
<p>This sheet, which is the last I chance to have, will not stand much more; and surely there were whole volumes to write yet. How are you, dear Mother? I wish Jenny would take the pen up again; why does not she? I feel certified now about the <hi rend="italic">fire;</hi> and fancy often that you sit warm enough &#x201C;when rocking winds are piping loud.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Milton, <hi rend="italic">Il Penseroso</hi>, l.126.</note> It is all very clear to my eye: the new Coal-box, the saddle riding there at the bedhead! Stuff the window-seams with paper; tell Jenny to do it, she will find it keep out the wind. Did Mrs Welsh send you the Book yet? We have no tidings of her for a week or two; but fancy she must now be got home.&#x2014; I would give something to know how Alick gets on with his Bacon-trade; I can only guess, and fear that it is not of the best, all things continuing so ill.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her letter of <date when="1836-01-17">17 Jan.</date> Janet had said, &#x201C;Alick is very busy indeed now he seems to be more contented now that he has something to do<supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D;</note> Tell that I know he did write a line to me last; but that I am in great want of another. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> gets all my news thro&#x2019; you. The like excuse you must make to every individual of the family, for really I am very busy, and like scribbling badly, having enough of it to do by compulsion. Yet I will pay my debts too. Give my brotherly affection, and kindest heart&#x2019;s-wishes to Alick and his household, to Jean and Mary and theirs. Alas, I think I owe Jean a Letter too. Do I not? Tell her to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">thole</hi></foreign>-made [patient], this time. As for Jenny, you can say that I am <hi rend="italic">shorted</hi>, or going to <hi rend="italic">short</hi>.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had told Carlyle the previous <date when="1835-06-00">June</date> that Janet felt &#x201C;shorted&#x201D; [annoyed] that he had not written; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-TC-JCHA-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCHA</corr>, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June 1835</date></ref>. Since then Carlyle had teased her with the term; cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-TC-JCHA-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCHA</corr>, <date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec. 1835</date></ref>, but Janet had just written to him, on <date when="1836-01-17">17 Jan.</date>, &#x201C;you must excuse mistakes in the intire dud for I am sure ther [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] are many only it will tell you nothing but good news and above all let you know that I am not shortened. that was a small stain put on my character which I was quite innocent of. therefor I <hi rend="italic">deny the charg</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] alltogether.&#x201D;</note> The two Jameses great and small are desired to accept my wishes. The <pb id="pg-08-285" n="08:285"/>poor Small has got more teeth I hope? His watery countenance and smile is getting dim for me, I find; but it will be all altered (for the better, one hopes) when we meet next. Good night, dear Mother; good night to one and all!&#x2014;</p>
<closer><salute>Your ever affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p><hi rend="italic">Tuesday, 1 o&#x2019;clock</hi>.&#x2014; I send you a new salutation, this morning, dear Mother, before the Letter goes off to Buller. There will a Newspaper go today, with a warning on it. No <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> came last week; for I got none: Hunt is a very unpunctual. His <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, poor fellow, by which he lived, has broken down suddenly, and he is now without work, without support, and eight or nine of a most thriftless ravenous family hanging on him: a man whom all men may justly pity! What he will do one cannot see rightly: he cannot dig, to beg he is ashamed.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360115-TC-JHLH-01">TC to <sic>LH</sic><corr>JHLH</corr>, [ca. <date when="1836-01-15">15 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> I have seen him twice lately; not for a long time previously: he speaks of trying the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (it was a Three-halfpenny Weekly Paper) under a new form. I pray heartily he may succeed in it.&#x2014; Did I mention last night that his son was drawing my Picture in oil colours?<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thornton. The portrait was unfinished.</note> The poor young man requested it, as a thing that might do him good; and I could not refuse, tho&#x2019; the task proves wearisome. Whether he will make a Likeness after all is very dubious: the figure at present is one of the roughest, grimmest; with &#x201C;a look that would split a pitcher,&#x201D; as the Irish say!&#x2014; Jane&#x2019;s cold is a little returned again, last night; and she will not go to dine today. She sends daughterly and sisterly love to all of you with open heart.&#x2014; Now surely Jenny or some charitable individual will write?</p>

<p><salute>My Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute> Notwithstanding my objections to the <hi rend="italic">overlapping</hi> system, and my hope to get out of it by a rigorous maintenance of silence till you wrote again, I find that under penalty probably of considerable atrabiliar misgivings to you, I must resume the <pb id="pg-08-286" n="08:286"/>pen just as we are. Your last Letter to me had no other than welcome news except this that mine to you had not got to hand; as I hoped it might do in a day or two after yours had come off. My own dilatoriness in sending it ought to have been a reproach to me. However I kept silence, and patience; and now about a week ago there has come Notice of a Scotsbrig Letter duly received and with continuance of good news; in which Letter it is stated that my luckless belated one did arrive &#x201C;the next day.&#x201D; I know not how it did not strike me that I ought <hi rend="italic">thereupon</hi> to write instantly: but so it was; Jenny in her report of your intelligence, gave no precept to that effect; which I carelessly thought there would have been, had <hi rend="italic">you</hi> not (mark my greed!) been minded to write hither also. Add to this that I was, am, and am like to be, extremely busy, getting on extremely ill; amid distractions; and hardly, both in morning and evening, can accomplish anything like the beggarliest task either as to quantity or quality. Not till this night does it strike me in all its glaringness what a villainous procedure I am carrying on with you,&#x2014;and I write; after hastily smoking! As it is very likely there may be another Letter of yours on the road before this arrive, let us finish the <hi rend="italic">overlapment</hi> in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> ingenious manner: Let a Letter have gone or not, do you instantly on receipt of this write to me as the beginning of a new account! Should your probable Letter contain any similar message to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> about writing instantly, understand beforehand that I am to disregard that. Whereby the <hi rend="italic">burble</hi> will handsomely clear itself, and all again be straight. See how my first page is gone; demonstrating merely that there is a burble!</p>
<p>We are well here, my brave Boy; as well as we have been usually. Jane has had a petty kind of cold, which never amounted to much, for a good while; but it is now gone, and even with it her general health was rather of the improved kind. As for me, I waver in the strangest way between a feeling sometimes almost like perfect (long-forgotten) health; and then suddenly a tumble into the valley of the shadow of deepest Bile and Confusion,&#x2014;till I rally again, and begin a new Chapter. My friend the black speck (hardly bigger than the half-diaphonous shadow of a pin-head) attends me pretty constantly, however; with its <foreign><hi rend="italic">Memento jecoris, jecoris</hi></foreign> [reminder of the liver]! I believe myself, at bottom, to be in an intoxicated rather despicable predicament: but I cannot help it; and shall evidently be no Better till this inestimable <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> get done. Courage, my <foreign>lad</foreign>! I will do it; I have still life and resources to do it: and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, there shall be such a rest as I have never had. Generally speaking the Book appears <pb id="pg-08-287" n="08:287"/>as worse than Nothing to me; but yet as attended with this one blessing, far beyond all others: that I shall <hi rend="italic">get done with it</hi>. I thought today, up at Hyde Park Corner; seeing all the carriages dash hither and thither, and so many human bipeds cheerily hurrying along: There go you, brothers, in your gilt carriages and prosperities better or worse, and make an extreme pother and confusion, the Devil very <hi rend="italic">largely</hi> in it: and I too,&#x2014;by the blessing of the Maker of me, I too am authorized, and equipped by Heaven&#x2019;s Act of Parliament, to do that small secret Somewhat, and will do it; without any consultation of yours! Let us be brothers, therefore, or at worst silent peaceable neighbours, and each go his way, with lips closed.&#x2014; Of the thing and things that are to come <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the Book I do not now give myself any the slightest thought hardly. They will be as they can and will. I find largely this crotchety adage fit me &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">De</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">deux</hi> <hi rend="italic">afflictions</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">une</hi> <hi rend="italic">Consolation quelque fois</hi></foreign> [two afflictions make one consolation sometimes]&#x201D;: it really does answer in three or four curious instances with me; and on the whole I keep myself as quiet as may be. &#x201C;Strength,&#x201D; I have written somewhere, &#x201C;is not seen in spasms; but in stout bearing of weight.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note>&#x2014; On the whole, Jack, I would thou wert here.

<p>There came a Letter from Jenny;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1836-01-17">17 Jan.</date></note> nay perhaps two Letters, since I wrote last: all was well in our dear Birthland; Mother&#x2019;s health &#x201C;fully better than when I saw her&#x201D;: she had gone down to Annan, was to be at Dumfries; everything went on in the good old way. Alick was said in general to be &#x201C;exceedingly busy&#x201D; with his Pork-speculations, and seemingly much happier. Poor fellow: he too has a hardish battle; but, one hopes, will fight it. Our dear Mother sent with her own hand <pb id="pg-08-289" n="08:289"/>&#x201C;blessings, and thanks to you for your good Letter&#x201D;; me she advises to take a glass of punch, of some whisky which poor Alick smuggled into one of two Provision-Barrels they sent us (by Whitehaven and the Land&#x2019;s End), which had just, after long waiting, got to hand.

<p>Wednesday 2 o&#x2019;clock.&#x2014; Dear Jack, I have finished my task today, and will now out for a little of this beautiful sunshine: our weather is generally very good here (except in summer). I know not what I can add, on the spur of the instant, if it be not a word meaning only good <pb id="pg-08-291" n="08:291"/>will.

<p>Miss Elliot called here again with Miss Morris; Jane unfortunately out: I went next day to her H&#xF4;tel; gone out (tho&#x2019; it was the earliest calling hour); next day she had to leave Town.

<salute>My dear Sister Jean,</salute>
<p>It is a long time since you got any direct word of me; indeed I rather think, I am still your debtor every way for that Letter: however, you have frequently enough learnt how I was going on, and doubtless imputed my silence to nothing wrong.&#x2014; I have this morning got done with another <hi rend="italic">Chapter</hi> (much to my poor heart&#x2019;s content); and will write you a line before beginning again. I had determined <pb id="pg-08-293" n="08:293"/>so, last night; and behold, about tea-time, there came-in this Letter from Munich, which of course confirms me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1836-01-24">24 Jan.</date></note> I am going to dine tonight (with a good Friend named Taylor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Henry Taylor; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311110-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:40</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1831-11-10">10 Jan. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note>), where probably there may be Honourable Members; one of whom will give me a frank: it is the main good one gets of Parliament.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh writes to us that she saw you in passing; that all was well, and the little <hi rend="italic">cracket</hi> [cricket] of an Alick chirping quite brisk. I learn too from Jenny that you have finally given up that House-bargain and House; and are to go (or perhaps you are already gone? No; that cannot be it.) to English street again.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Aitken had been buying a house in Academy Street from Carlyle&#x2019;s uncle John Aitken; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350112-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-01-12">12 Jan. 1835</date></ref>. James had told Carlyle in his letter of <date when="1835-12-14">14 Dec. 1835</date> that he was moving his shop and house to cheaper and bigger premises; Jenny added on <date when="1836-01-17">17 Jan.</date> that he had &#x201C;given up the house all together he has also given up the shop he now occupyes and has taken another one in the same street.&#x201D;</note> Perhaps it was far the best plan. Lawsuits and quarrels are to be avoided as the unprofitablest of all things: if you have not your House, you have your money, and can get another when you like. I hope James has work in these bad times, and gets on courageously. A light heart and a clear eye: these will help a man thro&#x2019; many things.</p>
<p>What became of Spence and the <hi rend="italic">Lasts?</hi> I have longed considerably for them, all the time I was wearing these villainous new shoes, which, however, happily proved of the worst leather (as well as shape) and are now done. Tell the worthy man to at least not destroy the <hi rend="italic">cast of the foot:</hi> I will have a mould made from it yet, by the blessing of Heaven.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350409-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1835-04-09">9 April 1835</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; I think sometimes of sending you up a lot of Mazagines &#x26;c when I can find a right conveyance: we shall see about it.</p>
<p>Jane has been ailing often thro&#x2019; Winter, and yet never very ill. &#x201C;Sniftering&#x201D; of Colds, &#x26;c &#x26;c; with an occasional sharp headache, but that not very frequently. With the Spring one may expect amendment, and briskness again. She sits here by me, reading my <hi rend="italic">two</hi> last finished Chapters (not without criticism and also praise), and sends you her kind wishes and remembrances. As for myself, I go on in a headlong kind of manner; perhaps, on the whole, considerably nearer health than I have been for a long time. I feel no fear or indeed care for any terrestrial enemy or chance, while working at this Book of mine. I am independent of the world in regard to it: the world will do to it <pb id="pg-08-294" n="08:294"/>exactly what it likes, were that nothing at all; I shall be well content, having <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it. This seems very strange, but it is true, and a blessed truth.&#x2014; With regard to the question, <hi rend="italic">when?</hi> I can still predict nothing; but may say that I am now getting on far better; and hope to be fairly in the Third Volume (at least) by the time Jack has appointed for coming. Would he were come, the good Doilter! Our Spring months from March to June (when it gets too hot) are the finest of the year. We have had generally a very good winter, as to weather; I have worked and lived in it with infinitely less of suffering than thro&#x2019; the Oven-heat of last summer. Such another Oven-heat I think I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> never endure again,&#x2014;should I take a job of driving Highland <foreign>Stots</foreign> [oxen] for the sake of country air.&#x2014; According to M&#x2019;Diarmid you have had but windy work of it;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Courier,</hi> <date when="1836-01-27">27 Jan.</date>, had reported severe gales on <date when="1836-01-23">23 Jan.</date>, damaging most of the houses in Dumfries and blowing a large factory chimney in Maxwelltown into the river.</note> but I hope you are thro&#x2019; it unhurt all of you, and the worst past. I have often thought of the Scotsbrig house, and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gurling</hi></foreign> [howling] of that Chimney-head of our Mother&#x2019;s in windy nights. I fear Alick has never taken the Chimney-Cann [pot] for the back-smoke? I wish I could hear that he had.</p>
<p>I know not what I have to tell you of my seeings or doings lately that could interest you. My main history, as you see, is over my Desk; one day of it like another.&#x2014; We meet plenty of people; could easily meet more than plenty: English and Foreign, Italian, German, French; &#x201C;each comely in its kind.&#x201D; It is one or rather it is the only, great blessing connected with this monster of a Place. You are allowed to live in some sort of peaceable brotherhood with your fellow creatures, and feel yourself a man among men: not a Hermit set on a Hill, with Black-Cattle and staring Bogtrotters round you. O that weary Hill of Puttoch! Never thro&#x2019; the longest human existence shall I forget that: never, I think, till I have sailed round all the Seas and Lands of this Terraqueous Planet, will I pitch again <hi rend="italic">there</hi>.&#x2014; In other respects, London, as I say, is a monster; eminently unfit for the poor and honest. For example, we are eating fresh butter, of very <hi rend="italic">pale</hi> complexion, at the easy rate of 18 pence a pound! Salt can be had at 1 shilling: but we tried it out of five or six different shops; found it all in a state&#x2014;of putridity, detestable to gods and men. So it is with most other things, in the way of outward accommodation, dirty air, dirty water, dirty houses&#x2014;dirt and death. The people puddle on. One must take (as usual) the Evil along with the good.</p>
<p>There has been rather a Cessation of Newspapers lately, which <pb id="pg-08-295" n="08:295"/>might perhaps surprise you. Truth is, the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> has been given up by Mill;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had been giving Carlyle copies of the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> since <date when="1834-12-00">Dec. 1834</date>; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341201-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:343</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-12-01">1 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> and I seized that opportunity to protest against his troubling himself with me any farther in the matter. I could not read those dull leaden <hi rend="italic">Globes;</hi> and there was <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [fuss] on all hands, sending them, and getting them. The <hi rend="italic">only</hi> thing I regret is the advantage they gave me of telling you all, very frequently, by such simple means, that I was well and thinking of you. This I do regret: but will try now and then to snatch an old Newspaper when I can, and do it still. Only if none come, know the reason of it.&#x2014; Speaking of Newspaper<supplied>[s]</supplied>, is not your <hi rend="italic">Times</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Times</hi> (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330108-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:293&#x2013;94</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-01-08">8 Jan. 1833</date></corr></ref>), now chiefly owned by James Brown, town clerk of Dumfries, and edited by Thomas Harkness. It lasted until <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>.</note> given up? I heard of Douglas<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert K.

He also is an &#x201C;Able Editor,&#x201D; and can do excellently well without <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.</p>
<p>I do not take the smallest interest in what is called &#x201C;Public Business,&#x201D; Politics, &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;which in fact is rather &#x201C;Public Idleness with Noise.&#x201D; Let them jar away there; they &#x201C;can <hi rend="italic">di&#x2019; tha naither ill na&#x2019; guid</hi>.&#x201D; O&#x2019;Connell makes a great talking everywhere;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >O&#x2019;Connell attended a series of dinners in Ireland and England during <date when="1836-01-00">January</date> which were reported particularly in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> which regarded him as a &#x201C;moral pestilence&#x201D; (<date when="1836-02-02">2 Feb.</date>).</note> and is truly become the King of the Country for the time being: more shame to it, that it can get no better! Big Beggarman, or what else you call him, there is really none other bu<supplied>[t]</supplied> that Irish Savage, who seems to have any notion what to do, or any courage in him to do it. &#x201C;May the Lord put an end unto all cruel wars / Send peace and contentment to all British Tars!&#x201D; I see abundance of Political Men; radicals and all that: but contrive to get a little talk out of them apart from that &#x201C;general overturn,&#x201D; which to myself is making itself plain enough</p>
<p>I wrote to Jack, shortly after Jenny&#x2019;s Letter; he will have got me by this time: so be at ease on that head. He is to write to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> again directly on receiving mine, and so our Correspondence to proceed regularly after.&#x2014; On my Mother&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> today I mark that she will see this from you on Wednesday.

Jenny&#x2019;s Letter<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1836-01-17">17 Jan.</date></note> came very opportunely, just about the time mine would come. Thank her, and all of them; and say they must write soon again.&#x2014; I will add a little <hi rend="italic">scrape of a pen</hi> for Alick whom you will probably see on Wednesday.

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I really am extremely tired, having written and done little else for a long while; and have already told all my news to Jean, which you will see,&#x2014;yet I will not let the Opportunity pass without a word for yourself, which you will prize the more on that account. I had indeed some words from your hand, which I am still indebted for, and was very thankful to see. You must take a sheet, and fill it yourself, however.</p>
<p>It gave me much satisfaction to hear of your being at least <hi rend="italic">comfortably busy</hi>. &#x201C;The Devil,&#x201D; they say truly, &#x201C;is always at the elbow of an idle man.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; cf. Kelly, <hi rend="italic">Scottish Proverbs,</hi> p. 221.</note> Grahame, from whom I heard lately, tells me &#x201C;it is a brisk trade&#x201D;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham&#x2019;s letter to Carlyle of <date when="1836-01-21">21 Jan.</date> has been preserved, but the portion of it in which he uses this phrase is missing. Graham&#x2019;s letter, however, contains other interesting passages: &#x201C;You have heard and read of the terrible fire in New York; I have a letter from my Brother on the subject, with sundry papers and plans of the part destroyed&#x2014;fifty-two acres of ground closely built with warehouses, three to five stories, in the main business part of the City&#x2014;almost nothing saved; and amongst many thousands ruined, my poor Brother has not only lost his late earnings, but his Mother-in-law has lost a large part of her property. She has $7000 invested in Insurance Stock; it is lost to a farthing, as none of the Insurance Offices can pay fifty cents to the dollar of their policy. It is truly hard: the old lady is turned to eighty years; her only child is my Brother&#x2019;s Wife. My Brother Peter also suffers indirectly: he carried on a Commission Dry Goods business, and mainly with New York, where the stock of goods are principally destroyed. As a City New York will in time recover itself; but comparatively few of those made beggars will recover their independence. Fortunately my Brother&#x2019;s House was out of the vortex, so things might have been much worse with him: here is some cause of thankfulness. [Part of the letter is missing here.]
<p>&#x201C;&#x2026; Ben Nelson told James Stewart that you thought of giving up your present position and studies. Is this settled so, or what other views have you? Please excuse the freedom of my inquiry. I take it for granted that you are progressing in the meantime with the Book that has cost you already so much labour and vexation. I hope you enjoy some degree of health, and that Mrs. Carlyle is quite recovered.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was at Grange lately. Mrs. Johnstone is not in good spirits; it is not to be expected, indeed. She has made up her mind to try the farming for a year or two at least. I am glad to say that through the friendly agency of Charles Stewart, her disputes with James Johnstone of Cowburn are now settled; he threatened to break his Mother&#x2019;s Will, and in sundry other things to give her great trouble,&#x2014;all which, I hope, is at an end. But what a change is at Grange, since the death of Mr. Johnstone!</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have a letter from David Hope lately; he speaks of retiring from Public life, that is, from the Council; says he is tired of it.&#x201D; The New York fire had occurred on <date when="1835-12-16">16</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-12-17">17 Dec. 1835</date>, exacerbated by lack of water, and had destroyed $20 million of property.</p></note> whether a profitable one or not, I suppose no man can <pb id="pg-08-297" n="08:297"/>yet predict. Stick to it, my brave Boy, with assiduity, with patience, with steadiness. Better times must and will come for us all; and <hi rend="italic">shall</hi>, should we even cross the Water to seek them. O man that can till soil, can <hi rend="italic">find</hi> soil yet in this Planet Earth, and it will give him bread if he till it! As for me, who can neither dig nor beg, I still do not a jot fear what is to come. &#x201C;There is life for a living bodie&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; cf. Kelly, <hi rend="italic">Scottish Proverbs</hi>, p. 323, and <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340722-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:245</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-07-22">22 July 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> fear it not.</p>
<p>I saw lately a Mr John Greig<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Greig (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>) had emigrated <date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>; he was admitted to the Bar, <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>, and practiced law and lived in Canandaigua, N.Y.; president of Ontario Bank, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>; regent, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>, and vice-chancellor, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>, of State University of New York; member for New York in U.S. House of Representatives, <date when="1841-05-00">May</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-09-00">Sept. 1841</date>. He helped Alexander in his emigration to North America in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>.</note> from the State of New-York, on his way northward to Edinburgh. He is a notable man. From Moffat about thirty years ago he set out, with an inkhorn at his button, unknown to all people; and now, I understand, he is grown a very King in that region, manages all public business, the benefactor of many, and has wealth&#x2014;&#x201C;a hundred a year for his Cook alone&#x201D;! I really liked the good man (he is an old friend of Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s); and hope to see more of him as he returns this way. He seems to come over every three or four years; and thinks no more of a trip over the Atlantic and back, than many people would of one to Maryport or Bowness.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Twenty-two and three miles respectively across the Solway Firth from Port Annan.</note>&#x2014; Grahame knows him well. By the bye, tell Grahame when you see him that I received his Letter with real thankfulness; and will surely answer it: but you can explain to him how unspeakably busy I am, and excluded from all adventures, or things noteworthy,&#x2014;except in my Inkbottle, at what <hi rend="italic">it</hi> yields me or refuses.</p>
<p>Jack you will see promises to come to us in <date when="1836-04-00">April</date>. May the winds blow fair for him! One will be very curious to see what he has grown into since we parted. Evidently the great heart of Doil is unchanged. Poor fellow, after all!</p>
<p>You would hear how we got the Barrels. All was right at last: the <pb id="pg-08-298" n="08:298"/>Potatoes had been slightly frostbitten, but only about the ends of the Barrel; they are wonderfully good considering what a stew they had. The Meal is equal to any that we ever ate, or need wish to eat. I often enough make myself a glass of punch of your whisky, and enjoy it after such risks as it ran. The liquor is decidedly good; I let none but favourites taste of it.</p>
<p>Will you remember us in all kindness to Mary; explain to her why fewer or no Newspapers come, as Jean will explain to you. She can report that the woman Ann is strong and well; going on with energy, unweariedly.</p>
<p>Take up that Cann<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Earthenware chimney-pot, mentioned in <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360205-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1836-02-05">5 Feb.</date></ref></note> to Scotsbrig, the first good day you have! Do, like a good fellow. The back-<foreign>reek</foreign> which this would cure was quite abominable.</p>
<p>Jane sends her love to Jenny and Jane and you. Remember me affectionately to them, not forgetting fat Tom tho&#x2019; he would not speak to me.&#x2014; I<supplied>[f you s]</supplied>ee Ben Nelson, also remember me. Can James Austin tell me anything about Glen? I fear, Nothing, or nothing good.&#x2014; Oh dear Alick how tired I am! Write to me <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>.</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was much shocked today on opening the Newspaper to find in it a brief announcement that your little Margaret had been taken from you last Saturday.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1836-02-13">Feb. 13</date>. Born <date when="1835-04-00">April, 1835</date>, Margaret had died of measles.</note> Apparently the call had been very sudden; for Jean, writing to me the week before, said nothing of any illness.&#x2014; I remember the <foreign>gleg</foreign>[active]-looking little creature in its Mother&#x2019;s arms; and feel sorrow for you all. It was not to know the good and evil of Life, poor little child; but to be called hence and cut off, while yet but looking into the world! The course of human destiny is &#x201C;fearful and wonderful&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 139:14.</note> ever as of old. Alas, one can say nothing, <hi rend="italic">nothing;</hi>&#x2014;except, if it so might be, what the wise have submissively said before <pb id="pg-08-299" n="08:299"/>us: &#x201C;The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away; blessed be the name of the Lord!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 1:21.</note></p>
<p>I trust neither you nor Jenny will give yourselves up to unavailing distress, or lament beyond measure. Some natural tears are due and unavoidable; the innocent ways of such a being, briefly lent us, will plead painfully in the parents&#x2019; bosom: but what then? Is not <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Human Life a Shadow; and whatever lives fast going down to Death? We shall <hi rend="italic">all</hi> be gathered thither ere long: &#x201C;we shall go to them, they will not return to us.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 2 Sam. 12:23.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; My dear Brother, I feel how vain all words are; whatsoever I could write would fall useless, where the stroke has fallen. It will show only that I grieve in your grief, and feel as a Brother for what befals you, which is the little all that man can do for man.</p>
<p>I had thoughts of writing to you these several days; but this sad occurrence hastens me: tho&#x2019; I have no time or composure to write anything, I send you this Note of Remembrance; with Jack&#x2019;s Letter,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1836-02-03">3 Feb.</date></note> it will not be worthless to you.</p>
<p>Jack as you will notice gives us hope of seeing him before many weeks. I sent him off last week&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> (which accordingly my Mother <hi rend="italic">missed</hi>); I must write to him, the final Munich Letter, one of these days.</p>
<p>What is to become of us all when he returns, and consults, does look uncertain: but that it will be blessed to meet again, and exchange counsel once more, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is not uncertain. I think in general we have &#x201C;a wide world,&#x201D; tho&#x2019; full of impediments, and must set our face handsomely to it. For myself I cannot be said to fear anything, or almost to hope anything from this old country of ours. Things have grown so utterly contradictory and impracticable round me that I have, as it were retired within my own citadel, and very quietly bid them welter their way, and do, in short whatsoever it is their pleasure to do. By the grace of Heaven, I mean to keep my own senses clear, my own heart free and ready; and innumerable cobwebs shall be nothing but cobweb to me. But on the whole surely my position here is a very strange one,&#x2014;as indeed is usually appointed for the like of me. Many men honour me, some even seem to love me; and withal in a given space of time I shall have no bread left here. So we must go and seek it elsewhere then? Clearly; go, were it to Jerusalem (as our <pb id="pg-08-300" n="08:300"/>brave Father used to say);<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270619-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:233</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-06-19">19 June 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> and seek cheerfully&#x2014;whatsoever is allotted us. All things are tolerable, all losses but the loss of <hi rend="italic">oneself;</hi> which latter is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> entailed on us.</p>
<p>But after all there is a brighter side of possibilities; and much may be better than we think. For this also we shall hope to be ready, to be thankful; and to do wisely with this too. Lucky they who as poor Cowthwaite expressed himself can &#x201C;do <hi rend="italic">owther</hi> way&#x201D;!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280126-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:311</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-01-26">26 Jan. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Meanwhile, what forms always my best and indeed for the present my only news: the Book still progresses. I do hope you will all be amused reading it some day before <hi rend="italic">very</hi> long. Were it once finished, I think I shall be one of the merriest men,&#x2014;for a little season! I am in a new Chapter, the ground fairly broken; and do not take the thing too violently. I am getting on far better than I did. There are but two Chapters more, and then the Second Volume is done. One other tough spell for the Third; and then&#x2014;! I think the subject is good; and I study to handle it as well and faithfully as I can. Courage! Courage!</p>
<p>Jean gratified me not a little by the news that your trade this winter had been profitable and favourable. It was surely time that you should find <hi rend="italic">some</hi> encouragement somewhere; of late years, on all hands, you have had enough to struggle with. I long to hear the particulars, and what you aim at now, or whether that salting trade still goes on for a while. I suppose, farms, as usual, are mad<supplied>[, you]</supplied> contented, since it is so, to let them go their own way; and let another than you be ruined <supplied>[by t]</supplied>hem. M&#x2019;Diarmid says the quartern loaf is sixpence, that wages are &#x201C;very steady,&#x201D; and all as usua<supplied>[l is]</supplied> go<supplied>[ing o]</supplied>n wheels. I shall be most particularly happy to hear it <hi rend="italic">confirmed;</hi> and see anywhere in [page torn] <supplied>[Britain]</supplied> evidence of it with my own eyes!</p>
<p>The news I co<supplied>[uld s]</supplied>end you from this Babylon would be [page torn]. We have had two days of the fiercest blustering Nort<supplied>[h wind]</supplied>, and plenty of February dust; on th<supplied>[e whole]</supplied> weather that I do not dislike. Plenty of wind, and this flat region and huge smoke-cloud is beara<supplied>[ble]</supplied> [page torn]: but O the summer, the hot burning stagnancy of Summer!

His son was his partner until <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, and an educational writer; he was a friend of Mill, and worked on the Royal Commission on unemployed handloom weavers, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, publishing a separate report, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, advocating repeal of the corn laws and improved elementary education; he advocated national education on the pattern of Dutch and German methods.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I must write you a brief word tonight; and very brief it must be, considering what O&#x2019;clock we are at.</p>
<p>The day your Letter came, I proceeded to make inquiries about Corrie&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Corrie or Currie (d. <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), Carlyle&#x2019;s cousin, was the son of John Currie of Braehead and of Janet Aitken, Carlyle&#x2019;s maternal aunt, both dead. According to Jean&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1837-03-14">14 March 1837</date>, John Corrie was a dissatisfied young man who was looked after by Mrs. Clyde (see below) and had long held vague hopes that his better-off relatives might rescue him.</note> Kinsman. As you would notice by the Newspaper, I found out both that he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been here, and that he was here no longer. Archdeacon Corrie,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Daniel Corrie (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>) born in Argyll, educated at Trinity, Cambridge, had gone to India as Chaplain, Bengal Establishment, <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>; senior chaplain, Calcutta, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>; president of the Church Missionary Association, and the Archdeacon of Calcutta, <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>. He had become the first Bishop of Madras in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> and was instrumental in establishing the Madras Grammar School, which became Bishop Corrie&#x2019;s Grammar School.</note> it was told me, is a most worthy man, who has done much good in India; in consequence of which they have justly made him Bishop Corrie, and he sailed, with that title, to Madras, last <date when="1835-07-00">july</date>, where he must be arrived before now. It appears farther that he has two Brothers in this country (both in the English Church; one of them at Oxford<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact, at Cambridge: Henry Corrie, (d. <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>), the middle brother, was now rector of Blatherwick, Northamptonshire, and from <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> rector of Kettering, Northamptonshire; and the youngest brother George Elwes Corrie (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">1885</date>) was educated at Catherine Hall, Cambridge, where he remained tutor until <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>. He became Norisian professor of divinity, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>, and master of Jesus College, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>.</note>) and also a Sister, who was with him in India, and is now married at Leamington in Warwickshire.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary, married to John Walter Sherer.</note></p>
<p>If Corrie still think it worth while to write to the Bishop, it can still be done; tho&#x2019; Dumfries is now as near him as London is. Mr Clyde or Mrs Clyde<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. James and Mrs. Clyde of the First United Secession Chapel, Dumfries. Mrs Clyde was a daughter of the first minister, William Inglis. See also <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300629-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:117</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-06-29">29 June 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> could easily perform it for him; the address will be: &#x201C;The Right Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Bishop Corrie of Madras, India&#x201D;; and the Postmaster will easily explain how it can be sent.&#x2014; It strikes me that poor Corrie will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> do this; and yet that perhaps he <hi rend="italic">ought</hi>. I would have written myself to one of these English Corries, had I known <hi rend="italic">any</hi> <pb id="pg-08-303" n="08:303"/>particular that I could distin<supplied>[ct]</supplied>ly specify; but except the name &#x201C;John Corrie of Braehead&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the father of John Corrie and second cousin of Daniel Corrie, who said of him in his letter to John Corrie of <date when="1836-06-18">18 June</date>, &#x201C;your Father I well remember when a <foreign>lad</foreign> of about 12 years old I was then about 10&#x201D; (MS: NLS, 1763.155, a copy of his letter by Jean).</note> (somewhere in Nithsdale, as I guess), there was nothing I could found a question on. I ought to know the name of the Bishop&#x2019;s Father<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Corrie, curate of Colsterworth and vicar of Osbournby, Lincolnshire, <date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>, and rector of Morcott, Rutland, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>.</note> and in or near what Parish or District he and the old man of Braehead<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Corrie&#x2019;s grandfather, brother of Daniel&#x2019;s grandfather, John.</note> dwelt (the approximate <hi rend="italic">dates</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c were also good): I could then ask this English Corrie, &#x201C;was your Brother the Bishop such and such a man, that made inquiry about &#x26;c?<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently Daniel Corrie had initiated the enquiry for his relatives; and in his letter of <date when="1836-06-18">18 June</date> to John Corrie he remarks with pleasure, &#x201C;a relative remains to me in the land of my nativity.&#x201D;</note> In that case I have to answer that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a John Corrie, so and so situated; and leave you to impart the same to your Brother, and do what else is good.&#x201D;&#x2014; I rather incline to think it will still be worth while for me to do this; the rather if poor Corrie grow unwell, and get into straits.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1836-06-18">18 June</date>, Daniel Corrie enclosed &#xa3;5.00 and offered financial aid if John Corrie wished to set up in partnership with his uncle John Aitken. He also told him about his brothers and sister in case he should die suddenly in India. However John Corrie himself died shortly before Daniel Corrie&#x2019;s letter arrived: see AC to TC, <date when="1836-11-27">27 Nov.</date> (Marrs, p. 410).</note> I am truly sorry to hear he is threatened that way; pray advise him, aid him, all that you can.

<p>I have just been writing to Alick.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Last night I wrote a word or two to Alick and Jean, and the frank must not go today without some kind of token for you; to show visibly what you know unseen that I am still thinking of you. At the same time nothing must be <hi rend="italic">briefer</hi> than my brevity: consider only that my whole day&#x2019;s-work of writing is st<supplied>[i]</supplied>ll lying untouched; that I will not begin it till I have sealed up this correspondence.</p>
<p>Poor Alick has had a loss which he will feel deeply; I know you do all you can to console him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Margaret&#x2019;s death.</note> In trying to guess where <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are at this time, I rather figure that it must be at the Howes. O dear me! But we must not get despondent, or sick of heart: it is a world of blessings and hope as well as of crosses and fear; it is God&#x2019;s world;&#x2014;wherein, as you once told me, <hi rend="italic">if we <foreign>tine</foreign></hi> [lose] <hi rend="italic">heart we <foreign>tine</foreign> a&#x2019;</hi>.</p>
<p>By a hint in Jean&#x2019;s Letter, I gather that there is to be a new change of name and state before long.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet&#x2019;s marriage to Robert Hanning on <date when="1836-03-15">15 March</date>.</note> The particulars are yet all dark to me. I pray heartily that it may be for good to those mainly interested. I suppose it is their own well-deliberated resolution; in which, therefore what can we all do but forward them with our best help and wishes. I send many kindest regards to poor Jenny; and pray that God&#x2019;s Blessing may go with her whithersoever she go. If she can write to me, I shall be very happy; if not, I will not take it ill. There is much to be said in favour of <hi rend="italic">Rob;</hi> many a young woman might go farther and fare worse, I do think and say.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-305" n="08:305"/>And now, my dear Mother, how is this new change to affect <hi rend="italic">you?</hi> There are no more now of that kind; this is the last. For these last years we have seen nothing but changes, change upon change; to all of which you have most cheerfully adjusted yourself. Go on so, my dear Mother! It is true health and heroism of mind to do it: there is nothing <foreign><hi rend="italic">tint</hi></foreign> [lost] as long as one&#x2019;s heart is not <foreign><hi rend="italic">tint</hi></foreign>, but all else is remediable.</p>
<p>For one thing you will learn with true joy that there is a fair prospect of Jack in not many weeks now. He talks about the end of <date when="1836-03-00">March</date>. I think he will be for Scotland, perhaps not long after: at all rates, to know that he is here within the Four Seas, will be a great thing for you, from the first. As for myself I do not think I ought to stir from this spot till I get the Book done: <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, I am free as air for any enterprise whatsoever, for any fortune whatsoever. But we shall see, we shall see.</p>
<p>Jane bids me say that she is &#x201C;as cross as a <foreign>wuddie</foreign> [insane person],&#x201D; but very affectionate towards you, and on the whole an excellent Goody (in spite of the cold weather). Really she is in tolerable health; and as for me, I do think I am considerably better than I used to be.&#x2014; O my dear Mother, keep good fires, these bitter days. It is one of the worst seasons of the year; take all care of yourself.&#x2014; When am I to see another word from your hand? No other word can be so welcome to me.&#x2014; My kind love to Jamie and Isabella and the solid Nephew. Good be with you all!&#x2014; And now to work!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You charged me to write so that you might have the Letter by the <date when="1836-03-01">first of March</date>;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote last on <date when="1836-02-03">3 Feb.</date></note> I notice, this evening, by looking at a Newspaper date, that my time is fully come, and even gone, let me send by Paris itself: so dilatory am I always; and now more than ever in this matter of epistles, having no heart for anything! Come home to me, Boy; and let the Letter-writing cease. I would we saw it! And surely see it we <pb id="pg-08-306" n="08:306"/>shall, if the kind Powers have not determined all&#x2014;too sorrowfully for us.</p>
<p>There is no bad news anywhere, except one article which will be less so to you than it was to me, who knew the little subject of it. Alick&#x2019;s youngest child, a fine <foreign>gleg</foreign>-looking little creature, named after our Mother, is dead; of measles; rather suddenly, I think: but the news is quite laconic as yet, only marked on a Newspaper. Poor people: sorrow never fails long. I sent Alick your last Letter in a frank, with some words of sympathy; all I had to give.&#x2014; There was shortly before that a Letter from Jean, testifying of our Mother&#x2019;s continued health, and the general welfare: Alick&#x2019;s trade, it was guessed, would prove unexpectedly successful: they were all well then, and stirring. I added a Note for my Mother; whom I fancy on good grounds to have one bright hope, that of seeing the Doctor soon.&#x2014; Jean hinted in a kind of ambiguous way that Jenny was likely to be wedded &#x201C;in two months.&#x201D; I guessed that it was to Rob Haining [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], whose small <foreign>shifty</foreign> figure, in boyhood, you must remember. There might have been better matches conceivable; and yet still more easily worse. He is a most thoroughgoing whole-hearted little tidy fellow, Rob; grown a Manchester Dandy as I think I told you; likely to do feats in his way; may readily for one thing make wealth in abundance; and on the whole do good rather than mischief. At all events, the damsel it would appear will have it so; they have courted since almost infancy: so what is there to be said except, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gesegnet</hi></foreign> [Blessed]? I have not written to poor Jenny, but sent a message to her: she is a quick-tempered, indeed quick-minded, methodic, truthful little creature; and may take that destiny with tolerable hope.&#x2014; And so our Mother will be left solitary; and rapid Time will have brought another change. But fear not: our brave Mother will take it well; and with the heart she has never be left desolate. Jemmy&#x2019;s wife and she seemed to do very handsomely, and she has the rest about her. Her Houses too, on which her income depends, were like to get into a better train: Baker Park,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Park, baker of Ecclefechan. But the houses were apparently let to Hall Moffat, bootmaker; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370812-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1837-08-12">12 Aug. 1837</date></ref>.</note> a very &#x2019;sponsible man, was about bargaining for the large House next year, and perhaps even taking the whole set of them under his own charge. That village of Ecclefechan, which I passed thro&#x2019;, once or twice, gave me the strangest unearthly feeling; very sad, very ugly, yet not without a grandeur even a sacredness in the middle of such squalor. What is Eternal Rome, Jerusalem, or Nazareth itself, but a <hi rend="italic">temporary</hi> set of huts and habitations, where <pb id="pg-08-307" n="08:307"/>Being begins, and is, and then is not&#x2014;under God&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">un</hi>changing Heaven? Alas, I often feel as if Hades itself were slight change to me, from this fearful and wonderful mystery of a world; surely no greater miracle it were,&#x2014;past finding out. Let us bow down in the dust; and in silence (since for the present one has no <hi rend="italic">words</hi>) feel with the old wise, &#x201C;tho&#x2019; <hi rend="small-caps">he</hi> slay me, yet will I trust in him.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 13:15.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hier steh&#x2019; ich; kann nichts anders, Gott hilf mir</hi></foreign> [Here stand I; I can do no other, God assist me]!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240307-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:44</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1824-03-07">7 March 1824</date></corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, V, 135.</note>&#x2014; On the whole, I often meditate on Christian things; but find as good as no profit in talking of them here.

<p>If I tell you that my poor scribble, after above a week of rest, is again under way, and doing what it can, you must not grow weary of me and it: I have next to nothing else at present that seems to belong to me in this world. Whether the Book be good or be bad, it will to me be blessed in that one point,&#x2014;in its end. Yet after all, it is only my impatient temper that makes me so speak: for the poor thing, full of faults as it can be crammed, will have a thought or two, a genuine picture or two; and so <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be worthless: what more would I? The best news is that I hope to have the Second Volume fairly off at the time you appoint for returning: could all answer, how joyfully would I take my interregnum of vacation with Doil!

On the other hand,&#x2014;but indeed I have no &#x201C;other <hi rend="italic">hand</hi>,&#x201D; or economic <pb id="pg-08-308" n="08:308"/>guidance of any kind here; and go along, thro boundless &#x201C;quackery and triviality,&#x201D; in the peaceablest armed-neutrality <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any.

<p><salute>My dear John&#x2014;</salute>instead of getting the fag-end for my share I am favoured for once with a piece in the middle: Carlyle having several calls tonight, one to go and speak comfort to Leigh Hunt, on things in general; another to write a refusal of an editorship of&#x2014;a newspaper in the beautiful little town of Litchfield [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]!!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Staffordshire Examiner</hi>, a radical, anti-Tory weekly, was started <date when="1836-05-14">14 May</date>, printed and published at Lichfield by Alexander Martin. The first number, begun under &#x201C;the patronage of the people,&#x201D; saw &#x201C;Tory doctrines as being inimical to the welfare of the people, and the interests of humanity itself&#x201D; and warned against &#x201C;milk and water partizans&#x201D; of reform.</note>&#x2014;not beautiful enough however, it would seem, to make the prospect of spouting radicalism there &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">every day and all</hi>&#x201D; extremely seductive. Font Blanque [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the Examiner man, had written to Mill about it; and Mill in his usual business style dropt us a <hi rend="italic">threepenny;</hi> and Carlyle in another threepenny has answered <hi rend="italic">no</hi> by no means, and so the whole affair is ended almost as soon as begun. And the Litchfield radicals m<supplied>[ay]</supplied> bless their stars that it has <hi rend="italic">so</hi> ended! for if they had got him for their &#x2018;able Editor&#x2019; they would have found themselves, I imagine fully as ba<supplied>[dly]</supplied> off as Dean Swifts Tailors, or as Edward Irvings Missionaries who at their own &#x201C;particular desire&#x201D; were shut up for four hours to hear themselves abused like pickpockets&#x2014; O Mercy no&#x2014;not to a little provincial English town!

<p><date when="1836-02-25">25th</date> (<hi rend="italic">morning</hi>)&#x2014;My dear Brother, I finish this before beginning anything else. I was out with poor Hunt till near ten last night, and good for little when I came home. His <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi> (did I tell you?) has fallen to the ground; so with bad health, incipient old age, and thriftless imbecillity all round him, he has the sorriest outlook; yet keeps up his heart amazingly: &#x201C;a man of genius (real genius) in the shape of a Cockney&#x201D;! Mill has got very sickly; and I should not be surprised if it proved chronic and continuous with him: he cannot come out at night; I occasionally go to him, always with warm welcome. He is liker Ben Nelson in talent than anybody we know: naturally hardly so good a man in that way as Ben; but with far more culture. The old Mill, who is also sick these late months, I have never seen in his own house, and only once anywhere&#x2014;very transiently in Kensington Gardens, and not knowing that it was he. A wrinkled hard-looking little man; whom indeed I have no impatience to know; tho&#x2019; there is good stuff in him, and tenacity without end. The Lichfield Editorship Jane has told you of occasioned no difficulty. In fact as I grow older I grow more careless about appointments: Keep them, Gentlemen; I will do without them, (having long done, who knows how near <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> done?); and go my own fated way, not consulting you or them!&#x2014; I fancy the wide world, I fancy America the Backwoods and all this Planet; and am <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> of being perpetually <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> even <pb id="pg-08-310" n="08:310"/>for &#x201C;Literature&#x201D;: wisdom is surely possible (whatev<supplied>[er scribbl]</supplied>ing may be) <hi rend="italic">without</hi> bad health. As the Frenchman said: &#x201C;I begin to be weary of th<supplied>[e treatment]</supplied> I experience here.&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310911-JWC-TC-01"><sic>5:424</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1831-09-11">11 Sept. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allons</hi></foreign> therefore!</p>
<p>There is a sad falling off in our ink. I find also that I have sent you as good as no news at all. You must take the will for the deed; above all, you must come soon <hi rend="italic">home</hi>, and get them by word of mouth. Let me hope then this Letter will find you about packing up. May your poor Lady stand it well: what a Life is that,&#x2014;&#x201C;miserable in the bosom of grandeur&#x201D;! One&#x2019;s sympathy is due, tho not so easy to give. We are all tied and clogged; each by his several padlock; and which of us can break it? Give my kind remembrances to Lichtenthaler; my hope to Schelling (if you ever talk in that way) that I shall one day see him in this world.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written in his letter of <date when="1836-01-24">24 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Schelling was indisposed for nearly six weeks but now recovered. I do not attend his lectures, any more, as I find it costs me much time, and having not heard of his recovery immediately I missed six lectures and found the connexion broken so as to make them unintelligible to me. They will be published he says soon and may then be studied more completely. Lichtenthaler of the Royal Library is going on well, and much occupied with procuring new books, and arranging catalogues &#x26;c. He desired to be remembered to you last time I saw him.&#x201D; In his letter of <date when="1836-02-03">3 Feb.</date> John had written: &#x201C;Last week the Eichthals had a splendid ball which I could not well avoid going to; and there I saw the dignitaries and fashionables of Munich from the Crown Prince downwards. Schelling was there also and I had some talk with him.&#x201D;</note> If there be any Book of his <hi rend="italic">not</hi> about Metaphysic, buy it.&#x2014; I can think of no German commissions at the moment; except Bendixen&#x2019;s Lithograph of Jean Paul (to match <hi rend="italic">Goethe</hi>)<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Siegfried-Detlev Bendixen (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>) painter and lithographer, resident in London since <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>.

Nothing in it that was new: low prices, obstruction; not despondency, nor hardening of heart. Old Mrs Robinson (of the Buck Inn, Annan) is dead: she was in the door leaning on her staff, as I went by last. Her son Bob (whom you remember?) died a good many months ago.<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Robinson&#x2019;s death at 85 was reported in the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1836-02-10">10 Feb.</date> For Bob&#x2019;s death, see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350702-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-07-02">2 July 1835</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Tomorrow (Saturday morning) I go out into Kent, not far from Maidstone, with John Mill; invited by a certain &#x201C;Mr Hickson&#x201D; Shoemaker and Farmer, whom I have not seen; who is said to be the flower of all them that draw the <foreign><hi rend="italic">lingle</hi></foreign> [shoemaker&#x2019;s thread].

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>I can, as you conjecture, do nothing with the Litchfield Editorship; least of all at present.</p>
<p>Does Fonblanque know Craik,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Lillie Craik (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350920-JWC-SS-01">JWC to <sic>SH</sic><corr>SS</corr>, [<date when="1835-09-20">20 Sept. 1835</date>]</ref>).</note> late of the <hi rend="italic">Printing Machine?</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350600-TC-JHLH-01">TC to <sic>LH</sic><corr>JHLH</corr>, [ca. <date when="1835-06-00">early June 1835</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350923-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-09-23">23 Sept. 1835</date></ref>.</note> Since once that I heard you speak of Craik, I have happened to fall <pb id="pg-08-312" n="08:312"/>in with him; and fancy you would rate his value higher then your estimate at that time seemed to go.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill wrote to Fonblanque on <date when="1836-02-26">Friday, [26 Feb.]</date>, passing on Carlyle&#x2019;s recommendation of Craik that follows (Mineka, XII, 299; Mineka follows A. Carlyle&#x2019;s dating of Carlyle&#x2019;s letter and hence misdates Mill&#x2019;s letter as <date when="1836-02-27">27 Feb.</date>).</note> He is a man limited; but honest, and singularly <hi rend="italic">healthy</hi>, and even robust, within his limits. He cannot be brilliant, but he can be decided, clear, and even emphatic. I should think him a believer with his whole heart in such policy as this present Russel-Melbourne, and open to all manner of farther light. The man is good-tempered, courageous; can take a handsome lift of anything. If I mistake not, such an offer would be excellent news to him at present: I have not heard of him for months; which means I fear that he is in straits and uncertainty.</p>
<p>I have been thinking of the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminister Review</hi>.

St. John Packe, <hi rend="italic">Life of John Stuart Mill</hi> (London, <date when="1954-00-00">1954</date>), p. 210, wrongly suggests that it was by Carlyle. But the implications of what Carlyle says are merely that &#x201C;The Epicier&#x201D; would make a good appetizer for his &#x201C;Diamond Necklace.&#x201D; In fact, the latter was to appear in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi>, <date when="1837-01-00">Jan.</date> and <date when="1837-02-00">Feb. 1837</date>. &#x201C;The Epicier&#x201D; [grocer] is the essential <foreign><hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi></foreign>, and Louis Philippe the incarnation of the grocer spirit: he is, as it were, a &#x201C;gigman.&#x201D;</note> was as a kind of introduction to such things.

<salute>Dear Dear Eliza</salute>
<p>It has several times occurred to me of late, with a painful force of apprehension, that I am what is called <hi rend="italic">bewitched</hi>. I sit here week after week, month after month, looking at things which I have the most evident call to do, and with apparently no more power to bestir myself than the Lady in Comus! For instance with respect to yourself; I have wished to tell you, have meant to tell you, and by all laws of good loving ought to have told you, ages ago; that I am still alive, and true to you as in the days of my <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>wee</foreign> existence&#x201D;!</hi> And yet for no visible reason, I have gone on telling you nothing of the sort.&#x2014;nothing of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> sort&#x2014;but leaving you to suppose me a heartless renegade, unless indeed your faith be greater than that of woman. Well! believe it or no, as you like and can; I love you still with all the <hi rend="italic">ardour of my young enthusiasm</hi>&#x2014;much more heartily and trustfully than I am apt to love nowadays with my middleaged discretion. Yet I have set myself very seriously to the business of loving since I came here&#x2014;conscious that my long sojourn in the wilderness had developed certain misanthrophical tendencies in me that were leading me rather devilward,&#x2014;into the region of hatred and all uncharitabl<supplied>[e]</supplied>ness! With a good deal of effort I have got up a sentiment for several men and women which has a good right to go by the name of friendship in these days. I have even executed two or three <hi rend="italic">innocent flirtations</hi> with good effect, and on the whole live in great amity with my fellow creatures. They call me <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;sweet,&#x201D;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;gentle&#x201D;;</hi> and some of the men go the length of calling me &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">endearing</hi>&#x201D; and I laugh in my sleeve<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane has followed &#x201C;sleeve&#x201D; with a small drawing of a woman, hand to her face, laughing up her sleeve.</note> and think oh Lord! if you but knew what a brimstone of a creature I am behind all this beautiful amiability! But my <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> dearest, is not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">got up</hi>,&#x201D; but grown up with me out of my sunny childhood, and wears always a sunny healthful look that these half-literary half-sentimental intimacies contracted after thirty can never match. The fault however is not in the <hi rend="italic">people</hi> but in the <hi rend="italic">time</hi>. &#x201C;You great fool&#x201D; said my Uncle Robert, once to me, when I was flying into somebody&#x2019;s arms on the North Bridge, &#x201C;you will surely learn sometime or other that every body is not in such ecstacies to see you as you are in to 
<pb id="pg-08-314" n="08:314"/>see everybody&#x201D;!! My judicious Uncle! you were there and then a true Prophet! I have long ago learnt to distrust the ecstacies produced at sight of me in others, and consequently cease to give way to any sort of ecstacy in myself. When I fly into any ones arms <hi rend="italic">now</hi> and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">swear everlasting friendship</hi>&#x201D; it is always with a secret misgiving, and a secret and almost risibile [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] conscious of a certain <hi rend="italic">theatricality</hi> in the transaction. The words <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;forever&#x2019; &#x2018;eternal&#x2019; &#x2018;constant&#x2019; &#x2018;faithful&#x2019;</hi> and such like applied to the friendships and loves that one <hi rend="italic">begins</hi> at the years of discretion never fall on my ears except accompanied by something like the distant laugh of malicious friends. Melancholy effects of age!! &#x201C;O the days when I was young&#x201D;! and confident and foolish! Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like to be wise Bess? I dont at all!&#x2014;but one is is [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] obliged to put a good face on the matter. And so I sit here in no 5 Cheyne Row and make grave pantomime, and grave speech in acknowledgement of all the wisdom I hear uttered by the celebrated men and women of the age; thinking my own thought all the while which is often this or something like this&#x2014;&#x201C;Was not sitting under a hay-stack in a summers day with Bess and George Rennie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza herself and one of Jane&#x2019;s early suitors (see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220100-JBW-EA-01"><sic>2:17</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1822-01-15">15 Jan. 1822</date></corr></ref>).

<p>I got home about seven; after a wonderful day. Larks sang to me, over the red ploughed land, songs beautiful mysterious mournful,&#x2014;of old days. Heavy seamen at Gravesend sat drinking heavy-wet.

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>I am really almost sorry for you with this <hi rend="italic">Necklace;</hi> and begin to wish I had not troubled you with it at present. The <foreign><hi rend="italic">On-dira</hi></foreign> [what people will say], I fear, let the thing be published as it will, is like to be multiform, uncertain, little to the point: of a hundred readers, even that have felt there was some stuff in it, ninety and nine will call it singular extravagant in form; if some ten of these have a kind of inward misgiving, a feeling that the form after all perhaps came from <hi rend="italic">within</hi>, and was what it <hi rend="italic">best</hi> could be, and only contradicted Blair&#x2019;s Lectures<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hugh Blair (<date when="1718-00-00">1718</date>&#x2013;<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>), <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</hi> (London, <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>).</note> and use-and-wont because it could not help it,&#x2014;I shall reckon it much. And then the new complexity of its appearing in such a vehicle. I try greatly to put myself in your place; but cannot, with <pb id="pg-08-317" n="08:317"/>any effect towards due counsel, succeed in that. My plan I find hitherto in all cases had been a kind of desperate exclusive dependance on the <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> of the thing to be judged of; leaving all its <hi rend="italic">accidents</hi> to settle their own account as they could and would. If the thing comes out <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the right place, I say to myself, it will go <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the right place. It is a simple plan this, but perhaps a kind of desperate one. If I stood environed with responsibilities &#x26;c &#x26;c, who knows but I might see good to modify it not a little? My own habit is to read everything that has any reality of interest in it without asking questions; pardoning indeed <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things, but the want of this which is <hi rend="italic">un</hi>pardonable.</p>
<p>On the whole however I seem to see pretty well that unless this Singularity can be presented standing on its own legs, and telling its own story with calm face, we shall never make much of it. To try to squeeze it into the shape of a review-article, as such go, would be but a kind of deception; more offensive to a right radical taste than an open sin were. You might write a preface (tho&#x2019; I question whether it would profit), you might append Notes, modifications, <foreign>Sauerteig</foreign> [leaven]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Biography,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXVIII, 49&#x2013;53, where Carlyle quotes from the <hi rend="italic">&#xc6;sthetische Springwurzeln</hi> of his Professor Gottfried Sauerteig.</note> and the rest of it: but the thing, it seems to me, cannot be altered from its present shape without becoming a <foreign><hi rend="italic">quodlibet</hi></foreign> [pedantic disputation] of which no one (not even myself now) can give account. Fancy the matter standing like an <foreign><hi rend="italic">Epicier</hi></foreign> [grocer];<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360225-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1836-02-25">25 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> calmly beginning, and going on, as if there were nothing wrong: it presupposes a great <hi rend="italic">change</hi> in the form and character of the Periodical, a questionable extension of its objects, a throwing down of its limits; a thing questionable, but not a thing stupid or false.</p>
<p>For the rest I care nothing about <hi rend="italic">phrases</hi>, provided the meaning or a better one be expressed: I doubt meanwhile whether the <hi rend="italic">gig</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Diamond Necklace&#x201D; contains a note, quoting &#x201C;Thurtell&#x2019;s Trial,&#x201D; explaining the first use of the term <hi rend="italic">Gigman</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXVIII, 325).</note> could be weeded out without detriment, but it might be expounded with effort enough in a note on first using it. On the other hand (tho&#x2019; my Wife agrees in your opinion) it still seems to me, Cagliostro&#x2019;s sermon<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXVIII, 392&#x2013;402.</note> ought to stand; that the cutting of it off were a shearing of a man&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">skirts</hi> away, and leaving him in the most incomplete state.&#x2014; Does all this throw any light whatever on the course you have to take? It makes the question for you simpler: will the inevitable <hi rend="italic">wonder</hi> over <pb id="pg-08-318" n="08:318"/>this thing do good or do ill? Will those who cry, what an extravagant mountebank; or those who say inwardly, What will he say next? let us hear him,&#x2014;be the more numerous?</p>
<p>In conclusion, my dear Mill, let me remind you that my private interest in this thing is quite small; nay God knows whether in the long run it is not nothing. Secondly that if by any chance you decided affirmatively and thereby did yourself a mischief, it would fly in the teeth of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> best purpose too (the only portion of my purpose worth attending to), and be to me of all persons the most disagreeable.</p>
<p>So I leave it with you, therefore. My pen is <hi rend="italic">scratchy</hi>, and my head and my heart tonight; and I can say nothing other or clear; being indeed in a very puny dispirited way&#x2014;till I grow better again.</p>
<p>Did Landolphe<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> get the English Translation back from Fraser? If it is likely to prove of the smallest value to him otherwise my wife makes him welcome to it.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Jane&#x2019;s French translation (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360118-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1836-01-18">18 Jan.</date></ref>).</note> I rejoice that the poor fellow can get to Switzerland, and quit the beggarliest of all employments that men follow under this Sun.</p>
<p>Can you within the next few weeks send me back the <hi rend="italic">Louvet?</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Baptiste Louvet de Couvray (<date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797-00-00">97</date>), Girondist politician, member of the Council of Five Hundred, <date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>; author of <hi rend="italic">Les Amours du Chevalier de Faublas</hi> (Paris, <date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1789-00-00">89</date>); see <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> II, 60.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>There is little doubt but you are anxious enough to hear from me again before this time: yet I did not mean to write for some three days yet, when one other of those sorrowful &#x201C;chapters&#x201D; of mine is to be finished; had not a Munich Letter arrived this morning, with glad news in it, which I make haste to communicate to you. Tomorrow evening, we are to be at Mrs Buller&#x2019;s, when some Honourable Member or other will frank the thing for me. I make it ready tonight at any rate.</p>
<p>Did you see on a Newspaper that I had got a <hi rend="italic">Newspaper from Munich?</hi> It said: &#x201C;Soon.&#x201D; This time, Jack writes, as you will see, that they are determined to set out forthwith; that in fact they start tomorrow (Wednesday, or else the day after); and, if all go right, will be here in about a fortnight from this date!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s letter has not been found. In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1836-02-03">3 Feb.</date> he says: &#x201C;The best news in my present scrawl can be no other than the repetition of what I mentioned in my last, namely, that we expect to be in London sometime in <date when="1836-03-00">March</date> or at latest the beginning of <date when="1836-04-00">April</date>. &#x2026; Next letter will most likely tell you about our plans. Do not begin to expect it in less than a month or five weeks from this date.&#x201D;</note> Is not that good news? Let us hope that it will all turn out, according to calculation; that we shall have the happiness of seeing those we love once more. What Jack will do, or when he will be inclined for proceeding Northward is quite uncertain to me, as doubtless it is yet to himself: however, you may depend on getting notice directly, if we once saw his face here; and so about a fortnight after this comes to hand, you can begin <hi rend="italic">inquiring</hi>. We have had so many disappointments that one dares not <pb id="pg-08-320" n="08:320"/>be fully hopeful; yet surely we have a fair prospect and may hope a little! It is so natural always to &#x201C;join trembling with our mirth.&#x201D;&#x2014; Especially in this <foreign><hi rend="italic">ourie</hi></foreign> [gloomy] bilious state that I am in!</p>
<p>In fact for the last three weeks, I have not been so well as usual: a thing I find exampled among many of my friends; perhaps owing to the changes of this most changeful spring weather. Often enough have I asked myself, How poor Mother was standing it? I do believe it is very unwholesome; till once the heat do get in, and put the frosts to flight. Tho&#x2019; you used to say, I was always anxious about you in proportion to my own <foreign><hi rend="italic">fecklessness</hi></foreign> [weakness], yet I have generally endeavoured to believe that you were doing your best; which, in the absence of all light either way, is clearly the better belief. Jean&#x2019;s Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> of yesterday left the matter still dark; for indeed she seemed to have been in haste: but as the little she did say was of the right colour, and even her silence was confirmatory, I persuade myself that there is nothing materially wrong. As for myself too I must <hi rend="italic">add</hi> that the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ourie</hi></foreign> condition is greatly abated; and that I am in full activity again; the want of <hi rend="italic">which</hi> requisite was the great ailment with me. O that Book, that weary Book! The whole mischief for the time lies in <hi rend="italic">it</hi>. But I will be done with it; slow but sure; and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> get amends of it.</p>
<p>Jean mentions in a very brief way Jenny&#x2019;s marriage, which I had good mind of, the day it was to happen.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A week earlier, <date when="1836-03-15">Tues., 15 March</date>.</note> And they are gone, are they not, to Manchester; the poor youngsters, to front the world together? If I knew the address, I would send a line to them: but perhaps Jenny means to write hither? On the whole, one ought to take that matter too with equanimity, with thankfulness: I see not but they may do well enough in their position there, far better than the average. The one most to be sympathized with, to whom the change was change only, and bereavement in a sense, is our good Mother. Jean says <hi rend="italic">she</hi> stood it well. I know she did; as she does all things. Take no sorrow to heart, dear Mother. A right mind can never be left desolate; if one is taken, another will be given: if you begin to feel lonely, we are all about you, and will make some new arrangement for that. It is written, &#x201C;Here we have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> continuing City&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 13:14.</note> happy they that <hi rend="italic">elsewhere</hi> have one!</p>
<p>Alick wrote me a very kind and worthy Letter;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> very mournful in relation to his poor little girl: I have thought of it oftener than enough <pb id="pg-08-321" n="08:321"/>since; &#x201C;there are tears for all human things&#x201D;;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, I, 462.</note> they all <hi rend="italic">die</hi>, as to <hi rend="small-caps">time</hi>; yet under <hi rend="small-caps">time</hi> is there not an <hi rend="small-caps">eternity</hi> where all lives? Blessed be the lips that spake these Glad Tidings (<hi rend="italic">Evangel</hi>, or Good-News truly) to the heavy-laden children of men! O is it not spoken: &#x201C;All tears shall be wiped away from every eye&#x201D;!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 25:8.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>When you have opportunity tell Jean that I have tonight written to Corrie&#x2019;s Indian Bishop, telling the story as it stands; hinting to the Indian Bishop that he could communicate directly with John Corrie, if he liked, by the Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Mr Clyde, or by the Parish Minister of Dumfries<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Robert Wallace (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>) of St. Michael&#x2019;s, or Thomas Tudor Duncan (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>) of New Church.</note> who from &#x201C;Mr Aitken, Mason&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Aitken, John Corrie&#x2019;s maternal uncle.</note> there, could easily find out his man.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360218-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1836-02-18">18 Feb.</date></ref></note> It seems not improbable that the worthy Bishop will send some kind of word; but in six months time or seven, we may perhaps know m<supplied>[ore.]</supplied> I <supplied>[th]</supplied>ink at present (but am not sure) that six months is the <hi rend="italic">shortest</hi> time f<supplied>[or]</supplied> an answer. We shall see, we shall see; no ill is done at any rate.</p>
<p>Jane has been rather <foreign>feckless</foreign> [weak] too; she got herself frightened tonight too (in the evening when she went out) with a gallopping cart, which overset near her, and almost killed a Boy,&#x2014;whom she herself however plucked out, little worse! It has given her a head ache; and she is not in good heart.&#x2014; We take the shower-bath both of us, or rather have just begun to take it; and think we shall <foreign><hi rend="italic">storken</hi></foreign> [grow stronger again] by and by.&#x2014; I told you or Alick last time that I was just about going into the country with Mill for a day or two: I went; but it did me only harm, the fatigue, bustle &#x26;c: I came off for home <hi rend="italic">next</hi> day, tho&#x2019; the people were all very kind &#x26;c&#x2014;I felt quite sleepless, restless; so shouldered my Cloak, and walked some nine miles (thro&#x2019; beautiful chalk-hill country, with bushes and valleys, and not a <hi rend="italic">brook</hi> to be seen; the chalk swallows it all); a very pleasant thoughtful walk, with the Larks singing overhead: then a Steamboat swashed me up the River, which also was full of interest. We met the ships coming <hi rend="italic">out</hi> with the day&#x2019;s tide: I never saw such a sight; Liverpool was but a halfpenny-worth to it: there were ships of all sizes colours and countries flying along there, to all ends of the Earth, really like a flight of crows to Woodcock air; we could have flung pebbles at one another; and then&#x2014;they were gone, over the wide <pb id="pg-08-322" n="08:322"/>world; some of them, it might be, to the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> world! I find London an almost terrific place, never a dull one.&#x2014; Since then I have not stirred away; nor will I yet.</p>
<p>Our friends here are as kind as ever: but <hi rend="italic">my</hi> help after all lies not in friends at this time; solely in my own <hi rend="italic">self</hi>. If the King would ask me to dinner, I many times say, what would it do me but <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>. I am and have been as good as determined to refuse all dinners: yet I went out lately, to meet old Rogers, a queer old Poet here (rich Banker, Whig Politician &#x26;c &#x26;c); I liked the old man very well too, but should not care to have an <hi rend="italic">indigestion</hi> again for him.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> this same day: &#x201C;Some ten night&#x2019;s ago I dined at Taylor&#x2019;s, old Rogers there. A man with perfectly hairless head, with large clear, sagacious, sad, and cruel, blue eyes. A well bred man; easy, yet with whom no mortal could be <hi rend="italic">frank;</hi> not so <hi rend="italic">spare</hi> a figure as I had looked for, Flattery laid on pretty thick; sarcasm of slow quietly-decisive sort; perfect <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0;-propos</hi></foreign>: the man is a shrewd frozen sardonic old Whig,&#x2014;worth meeting, not worth running to meet. Let me remember also the want of the upper teeth (a small upper jaw at any rate), and how the horse-shoe mouth has adjusted itself to that. The head towers out hoary (from amid the black clothes) perfectly colourless except white; high; very queer-looking. Poor old man, thou hast perhaps none to love thee!&#x2014; Lockhart was there also that night (at the <foreign>soir&#xE9;e</foreign> which followed); but we did not speak.&#x201D; Samuel Rogers (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), poet and banker, friend of Wordsworth, Scott, and Byron; and famous for his breakfasts for the intelligentsia.</note> I wish my Book were done; and I do not for the present trouble myself to wish anything else at all.&#x2014; Poor John Sterling has been dangerously ill (spitting of blood); I should be right sorry, if aught befel him. Mill continues in the same weakly state: &#x201C;a disease of the mind&#x201D;; his Platonic love and he, it is thoug<supplied>[ht are]</supplied> getting awry some how,&#x2014;perhaps dissolving Partnership; which would indee<supplied>[d bring gr]</supplied>eat joy.&#x2014;(I have a little piece still free)</p>
<p>As the frank will carry it I send you this other American Epistle: it is from the uttermost corner of the Western Earth; almost as far beyond New York, as that is from us.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From James Freeman Clarke (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">88</date>), Transcendentalist and Unitarian minister at Louisville, Kentucky, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>. He edited the <hi rend="italic">Western Messenger</hi>, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>; founded the Church of the Disciples in Boston, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; and later became a trustee of Boston Public Library, <date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">88</date>, and nonresident professor of the Harvard Divinity School, <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>; he was to be active in temperance, antislavery, and women&#x2019;s suffrage. He had posted the letter to Carlyle on a visit to Mobile, Alabama, and describes how to Margaret Fuller, <date when="1836-03-28">28 March</date>: &#x201C;I saw a leathern bag hanging in a certain place marked thus: &#x2018;Letter Bag&#x2014;Ship Sarah&#x2014;sails tomorrow for Liverpool.&#x2019; I went home instantly and wrote a letter to Thos. Carlyle, returned, and dropped it in the bag, and am now waiting the result. Do you think Teufelsdr&#xF6;ck will take any notice of it? Or will he mistake me for a gigman?&#x201D; John Wesley Thomas, ed., <hi rend="italic">The Letters of James Freeman Clarke to Margaret Fuller</hi> (Hamburg, <date when="1957-00-00">1957</date>) p. 117.

I <pb id="pg-08-323" n="08:323"/>have not answered any of these American ones lately: if they can amuse you for a minute, it is the main good they do. How often in the course of their fine praises does the old rhyme come into my head:</p>

<p>The Picture Hunt&#x2019;s son was drawing has yet come to nothing. It grew so deadfully ugly, and promised to be so little like one&#x2019;s own ugliness, and was withal such a wearisome thing, that I shirked off, by some good opportunity and never came back again.</p>
<p>I send my kind brotherly affection to every one: my thanks specially to Alick, whom I mean to write to soon.

<p>Alick says, Jamie has got his Rent made up, which I was very glad to hear. Remembrances to the good Isabella, and her boy.&#x2014; Jane charged me to send her best regards, and I have almost forgot it&#x2014;<closer><salute>Good night! Good Night!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The last day of March being come, I must send off this to wait upon your way. May you find it at Brussels; and come home safe, with the answer by word of mouth! According to the calculation, you should be with us this day week. It seems so very singular, one hardly knows how to believe it: too good news to be true. We shall wait, watching with both eyes; if some omnibus, cab or hackney should actually roll up with you on the appointed night!</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Allgem. Zeitung</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Zeitung</hi>, German literary magazine, founded <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date> by J. F. Cotta (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), publisher of Schiller and Goethe, in Stuttgart, but published from <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date> to <date when="1882-00-00">1882</date> in Augsburg.</note> came to hand; charged 2 pence: 1 penny more than it would have cost me from Scotsbrig; one penny less than it would have cost from Hyde Park Corner. So curiously are these things ordered. Had we known of that convenience before, it might have been extensively applied. Let us hope, there may be no use for it now for a good while.&#x2014; Like yourself I have no patience to write at length in these circumstances: we shall so soon, if the Heavens be gracious, have a far better opportunity. What things are uppermost of the essential kind I will fling down at random.</p>
<p>First, then, all the Annandale people seem to continue well. I had a short scrub of a Note from Jean last week (I think): it was written about some special little matter (connected with John Corrie the Dumfries Mason and Kindred he has in India): but it contained this announcement flung in too. Alick had likewise written to me few days before; a very pathetic kind of Notice about his little <foreign>lassie</foreign>, &#x201C;now sleeping beside her kinsfolk&#x201D;: he added some details about our Mother and the rest. This other piece of news I gather from Jean&#x2019;s Letter in a very vague manner: that Jenny is actually married; and away with her brisk little man to Manchester forthwith; there, safe we may hope, at this hour! They sent us no special word: I do not even know their Address at Manchester: but a Newspaper came to me two days ago fresh from that Town, and addressed in a hand that seemed to be Jenny&#x2019;s; I took it as a sign. They say, our Mother bears it &#x201C;very well&#x201D;: but the whole matter, in such scantiness of detail, lies <pb id="pg-08-326" n="08:326"/>but dim to me. I sent off your last Letter, to Scotsbrig, the day after it got here: I daresay it was the best piece of news they had been favoured with since your last. I computed the days for them, into <hi rend="italic">week</hi> days; so that at Scotsbrig too there is doubtless waiting. For the present I figure you as hanging in vague Cloudland, as I know nothing specific about the country you travel thro&#x2019;: but then will you not alight upon the firm land; <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, on the <date when="1836-04-07">7<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of the month</date>!&#x2014; As you pass Gravesend (would you were so far!) you may fancy that I was there, on foot, some three weeks ago (tho&#x2019; I only <hi rend="italic">crossed</hi> your road); on what errand I will tell you some leisure day. John Mill was to go, and &#x201C;get better&#x201D; (in six and thirty hours) at a Place out there; and would not go without me: I went, and was so wretched, with my sickness and with the people (very good people called Hicksons, of the Shoemaker profession), that I bundled, on the first morrow, and walked off, making excuses on excuses, and got into the Steamboat again.&#x2014; Do you remember that this place of ours is pronounced <hi rend="italic">Chainie</hi> Row; and that Cheyne <hi rend="italic">Walk</hi> a more notable street, to which you may probably enough be driven, is close by. We are &#x201C;Cheyne Row&#x201D; or Great Cheyne Row; not <hi rend="italic">Upper</hi> Cheyne Row, which also is at our very hand. The name is on the door; and a brazen No &#x201C;5.&#x201D; Come my brave fellow, and knock!</p>
<p>I do not at the momen<supplied>[t]</supplied> recollect anything you can do for me at Brussels. There was a Book published (at Paris probably), of which I can give no better account than that it was a &#x201C;Collection of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bonmots</hi></foreign> uttered by people about to be guillotined&#x201D;: if you pass near any likely Bookseller&#x2019;s Shop, you might step in <hi rend="italic">once</hi>, and endeavour to ask for it; <hi rend="italic">one</hi> asking and a few shillings I would give; not more. For, on the whole, it is not Books that I want now; but good sense and good spirits to make use of what I have. Something like three hundred volumes; and I all biliousness and fret, and palpitating haste and bewilderment!&#x2014; For the last five weeks both Jane and I have been worse than usual; owing probably to the changeful weather of this season. I have had a sore wrestle with the Chapter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to A. Carlyle, what Carlyle called &#x201C;Chapters&#x201D; at this stage he later called &#x201C;Books&#x201D; and subdivided them into ordinary chapters; the &#x201C;Chapter&#x201D; he had just finished was Book IV, &#x201C;Varennes.&#x201D;</note> just done the day before yesterday: there are still two, tho&#x2019; much shorter ones, before this second volume ends. Heigho! It seems as if I were enchanted to this sad Book: peace in the world there will be none for me till I have it done. And then very generally it seems the miserablest mooncalf of a Book; full of <foreign><hi rend="italic">ziererei</hi></foreign>, affectation (do what I will); tumbling head foremost <pb id="pg-08-327" n="08:327"/>thro&#x2019; all manner of established rules.

<p>Our worst news is the illness of good John Sterling; indeed of both him and Mill. Sterling is of weak lungs, has often suffered almost to death: about 3 weeks ago, he was struck down; and for the last fortnight none of us see him. The Doctors (trusting in <hi rend="italic">stethoscope</hi>) seem to say his lungs are not radically deranged; but of so delicate irritable a structure that he must give up his preaching profession; and never think of passing another winter here. They speak of Madeira; of the West Indies, where he has property: I am very sad about it, for I love this man; a radiant, lambent all-hoping brotherly being,&#x2014;one of those you call &#x201C;too good to live.&#x201D; He and Taylor often seem to me very strangely like the two <hi rend="italic">halves</hi> of Edward Irving, living apart: it is a singular feeling, of sight and remembrance, of sadness and kindliness. My poor Irving is snatched away from me: away, away!&#x2014; John Mill also is very far from health, or approximation thereto. Wasted thin; and with the miserablest twitchings, and St-Vitus work going on about his face: the hair of his head is fast falling out this long while. I reckon it to be the fruit of that Taylor-Platonica affair mainly. His father also has been ill all winter; spitting of blood: I heard last week that they began to despair of his getting well. It is ha<supplied>[r]</supplied>d work.</p>
<p>I have a notion to write two Letters to America today; and postpone my Revolution studies, till night. If Jane have anything to say, let her write it a-top. If she have not, fancy her gone out (for she sits down stairs, these late weeks), or busy with <hi rend="italic">marmalade;</hi> but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> forgetful of you, not that.

<salute>My dear Cousinkin</salute>
<p>I am charmed to notice in you the rapid growth of a virtue, which for the most part only develops itself in mature age, after many and hard experiencies [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; but which is nevertheless highly necessary at <hi rend="italic">all</hi> ages, in this world of sin and misery: I mean the virtue of <hi rend="italic">toleration</hi>. Rarely is one edified by the spectacle of so young a Lady, meekly acknowledging her own transgressions and short-comings, when with perfect justice she might have adopted rather the tone of <hi rend="italic">accusation</hi>. Continue my sweet little Cousin to cultivate this engaging disposition, this beautiful sensibility to your own imperfections and beautiful <hi rend="italic">insensibility</hi> to the imperfections of your neighbour and you will become (if indeed you are not such already) an ornament to your sex, and a credit to <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;the name of Welsh&#x201D;</hi> (which my Mother talks about so proudly; I could never tell precisely <hi rend="italic">why</hi>.) In truth you will have added a new lustre of virtue to <hi rend="italic">that name</hi>, which I never hoped to see it brightened with: for as my Penfillan Grandfather&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane&#x2019;s paternal grandfather, who had lived at Penfillan farm (see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230606-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:369</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1823-06-06">6 June 1823</date></corr></ref>).</note> physiological observations, on his stock, had led him to the conclusion that it was capable of producing <hi rend="italic">rascals</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vagabonds</hi> enough, but not one solitary instance of <hi rend="italic">a blockhead;</hi> so <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> had hitherto tended to certify me, that <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;the name of Welsh&#x201D;</hi> had something in it <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> and <hi rend="italic">everlastingly</hi> antipathetical to patience and toleration, and was no more capable of coalescing with it than fire with water.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-330" n="08:330"/>The box came safe, as did also the herrings and the brandy&#x2014;shame to me that I should be now for the first time acknowledging them all in the lump! But I trust that my Mother reported my thanks, as she was charged to do, and that however much you may all have blamed my laziness, you have not suspected me of the atrocious sin of ingratitude, &#x201C;alike hateful to gods and men.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi>, 1.373.</note>&#x2014; At least it used to be so, but now that it is so common in the world people are getting into the way of regarding it, I suppose, as they do other fashionable vices <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;with one eye shut and the other not open&#x201D;</hi> (as an Irish author said to me the other day in describing his manner of reading a certain journal).<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably R. L. Sheil (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360331-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1836-03-31">31 March</date></ref>).</note> Rogers the Poet, who professes to be a man of extensive beneficence, and to have befriended necessitous persons without number in the course of his long life, declares that he never met with gratitude but in <hi rend="italic">three</hi> instances. I have a mind to ask him to do something for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, just that he may have the pleasure of swelling his beggarly list of grateful people to <hi rend="italic">four</hi>. For <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;the name of Welsh&#x201D;</hi> I flatter myself cherishes the old Athenian notions about gratitude.</p>
<p>We are labouring under a visitation of rain here which seems to portend the destruction of the world by deluge. One feels <hi rend="italic">soaked</hi> to the very heart&#x2014;no warmth or pith remaining in one&#x2014; As one fire is understood to drive out another, I thought one water might drive out another also, and so the other morning I took a showerbath&#x2014;and have shivered ever since. <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Too much of water hadst thou poor Ophelia&#x201D;!</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, IV, vii.</note> O Ellen!

The human mind stands astonished before it as before the infinite! In fact you have ever since figured in my imagination as a sort of <hi rend="italic">Undine!</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The water nymph of <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>) by F. H. C. de La Motte Fouqu&#xE9;.</note> Barring the weather, every thing goes on here in the usual way: People eat eight-oclock dinners together; talk politics, philosophy, folly together; attend what they call their <hi rend="italic">business</hi> at <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;the House,&#x201D;</hi> or where else it may happen to be; and fill up the intervals with vapours and something that goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;checked perspiration&#x201D;;</hi> but I can give you no idea of what that precisely means; it seems to comprehend every malady that flesh is heir to. and for my part, as the Co<supplied>[c]</supplied>kney said to Allan Cunningham of the lottery, <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;I am deadly sure there is</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">a do</hi> [trick] <hi rend="italic">at the bottom on it.&#x201D;!</hi></p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-331" n="08:331"/>We expect John Carlyle in some ten days: for this time his Lady will surely, for decensy&#x2019;s [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] sake, stick to her purpose, Lady of quality tho&#x2019; she be! I am afraid he is not a Man for grappling in a cunning manner with <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;checked perspiration,&#x201D;</hi> and accordingly that there is small hope of his getting into profitable employment here as a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. We do not know yet whether he will even try. But time will settle that and much else that waits to be settled. In the meanwhile there were no sense in worrying over schemes for a future which we may not live to see. &#x201C;Sufficient for the day is the evil there of&#x201D;!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I marked in your <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> yesterday that Jack was come, that there would be a Letter in 3 days: but now we hear of you in Dumfries, and as a Letter can find you instantly, no delay is to be made: Jack even will not hear of waiting &#x201C;a minute for a frank,&#x201D; but will <pb id="pg-08-334" n="08:334"/>&#x201C;pay it himself.&#x201D; He came, the day before yesterday, after being expected: a hackney Coach trundled up to the door just after dinner, with a Doctor and a great heap of luggage. He seems very glad; hearty, often-laughing; with a large broad face still, tho&#x2019; the hair has a decided shade of gray. He speaks of being &#x201C;detained at least a week or two.&#x201D; Read &#x201C;a month or two&#x201D; for all things are at sea yet with us; the man must <foreign><hi rend="italic">claver</hi></foreign> [talk idly] immensely, and inquire and speculate before any result be arrived at. Lady Clare is going back to Italy, he thinks: but whether she will take a Doctor; or whether he will go, is completely uncertain. There let it hang uncertain.&#x2014; Your Bank business will be done (on Wednesday first) exactly as the others were done: &#x201C;Money from Doctor Carlyle for Margaret Carlyle&#x201D; (never heeding the &#x201C;Jones &#x26; Comp<hi rend="italic">y</hi>&#x201D;); and James will put &#x201C;right&#x201D; on the Newspaper.&#x2014; Poor Jean and he! I wish they could put &#x201C;right&#x201D; too about their little Boy. They will be full of anxiety, and nothing can be done to help. Some Doctor&#x2019;s advice should be taken, tho&#x2019; I know not in the least whose; and know not much whether they can serve greatly. It rests with the Supreme Power, and we must keep hoping; you (that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> strive) hoping &#x26; striving.</p>
<p>We were largely contented with your good Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Mrs. Carlyle and James, <date when="1836-04-03">3 April</date>, James gave news of Jenny&#x2019;s departure after her wedding and Robert Hanning&#x2019;s address, &#x201C;draper, 41 Edge St., Manchester.&#x201D;</note> and thankful for it. But do not say now that you cannot write! That excuse will never pass again.&#x2014; Jane is pretty well, and very glad about the Doctor. I also am got round to my old condition; and have done a <hi rend="italic">task</hi> this day again, after idling yesterday. I shall very soon be thro&#x2019; the Second volume; then there is but one to do: and I mean to come and bury myself somewhere (say Dumfriesshire), in the profoundest rest, for three months after that. Courage! &#x201C;Steady!&#x201D; as the drill-serjeants say.&#x2014; I have sent two Newspapers to Jenny, one yesterday with a mark for Jack on it: I had got one in return from her that very day with &#x201C;Thanks; all well; write soon.&#x201D;&#x2014; Our affection to all and every one (all are present to me, but there is no room for names).&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Barnard is returning across the water, and must not go back without a flying salutation for you. These many weeks I have had your Letter by me; these many weeks I have felt always that it deserved and demanded a grateful answer; and, alas, also that I could give it none.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written to Carlyle on <date when="1836-04-08">8 April</date>: &#x201C;I am concerned at not hearing from you. I have written you two letters one in <date when="1835-10-00">October</date>, one in <date when="1835-11-00">November</date>, I believe, since I had any tidings of you.&#x201D; His <date when="1835-10-00">October</date> letter was dated <date when="1835-10-07">7 Oct.</date> Of the <date when="1835-11-00">November</date> letter Slater comments &#x201C;I know no record other than this of a letter written in <date when="1835-11-00">November</date>.&#x201D; Another letter mentioned by Emerson in his <date when="1835-10-00">October</date> letter was a note of acknowledgement for Carlyle&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1835-06-27">27 June 1835</date>, and introduction for Lydia Maria Francis Child (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>), abolitionist and author, written in <date when="1835-08-00">Aug. 1835</date>, but apparently never used as Mrs. Child did not make the trip.</note> It is impossible for you to figure what mood I am in. One sole thought, that Book! That weary Book! occupies me continually: wreck and confusion of all kinds goes tumbling and falling around me, within me; but to wreck and growth, to confusion and order, to the world at large I turn a deaf ear; and have life only for this one thing,&#x2014;which also in general I feel to be one of the pitifullest that ever man went about possessed with. Have compassion for me! It is really very miserable: but it will end. Some months more, and it is <hi rend="italic">ended;</hi> and I am done with French Revolution, and with Revolution and Revolt in general; and look once more, with free eyes, over this Earth, where are other things than mean internecine work of that kind: things fitter for me, under the bright Sun, on this green Mother&#x2019;s-bosom (tho&#x2019; the Devil does dwell in it)! For the present really, it is like a Nessus&#x2019; Shirt,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351102-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1835-11-02">2 Nov. 1835</date></ref>.</note> burning you into madness, this wretched Enterprise; nay it is also like a kind of Panoply, rendering you invulnerable insensible to all <hi rend="italic">other</hi> mischiefs.</p>
<p>I got the fatal First Volume finished (in the miserablest way, after great efforts) in <date when="1835-10-00">October</date> last; my head was all in a whirl; I fled to Scotland and my Mother for a month of rest. Rest is nowhere for the Son of Adam. All looked so &#x201C;spectral&#x201D; to me in my old-familiar Birthland; Hades itself could not have seemed stranger; Annandale also <pb id="pg-08-336" n="08:336"/>part of the Kingdom of <hi rend="small-caps">time</hi>. Since November I have worked again as I could; a second Volume got wrapt up and sealed out of my sight within the last three days. There is but a Third now: one pull more, and <hi rend="italic">then!</hi> It seems to me, I will fly into some obscurest cranny of the world, and lie silent there for a twelvemonth. The mind is weary, the body is very sick; a little black speck dances to and fro in the left eye (part of the <hi rend="italic">retina</hi> protesting against the liver, and striking work): I cannot help it; it must flutter and dance there, like a signal of distress, unanswered till I be done. My familiar friends tell me farther that the Book is all wrong, style cramp &#x26;c &#x26;c: my friends, I answer, you are very right; but this also, Heaven be my witness, I cannot help.&#x2014; In such sort do I live here; all this I had to write you, if I wrote at all.</p>
<p>For the rest I cannot say that this huge blind monster of a City is without some sort of charm for me. It leaves one alone, to go his own road unmolested. Deep in your soul you take up your protest against it, defy it, and even despise it; but need not divide yourself from it for that. Worldly individuals are glad to hear your thought if it have any Sincerity; they do not exasperate themselves or you about it; they have not even time for such a thing. Nay in stupidity itself on a scale of this magnitude, there is an impressiveness, almost a sublimity; one thinks how, in the words of Schiller, &#x201C;the very gods fight against it in vain&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Die Jungfrau von Orleans</hi>, III, vi, translated by Carlyle in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller, Works</hi>, XXV, 164, as &#x201C;stupidity can baffle the very gods.&#x201D;</note> how it lies on its unfathomable foundations there, inert yet peptic, nay eupeptic, and is a <hi rend="italic">Fact</hi> in the world, let theory object as it will. Brown-stout, in quantities that would float a seventy-four, goes down the throats of men; and the roaring flood of Life pours on;&#x2014;over which Philosophy and Theory are but a poor shriek of remonstrance, which oftenest were wiser perhaps to hold its peace. I grow daily to honour Facts more and more; and Theory less and less. A Fact it seems to me is a great thing: a Sentence printed if not by God, then at least by the Devil;&#x2014;neither Jeremy Bentham nor Lytton Bulwer had a hand in <hi rend="italic">that</hi>.</p>
<p>There are two or three of the best souls here I have known for long: I feel less alone with them; and yet one is alone; a stranger and a pilgrim.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 11:13.</note> These friends expect mainly that the Church of England is not dead but asleep;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 8:52.</note> that the leather coaches with their <pb id="pg-08-337" n="08:337"/>gilt pannels can be peopled again with a living Aristocracy, instead of the simulacra of such. I must altogether hold my peace to this; as I do to much. Coleridge is the Father of all these.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sterling, F. D. Maurice, and possibly the Rev.

<p>My friend! I must end here. Forgive me till I get done with this Book. Can you have the generosity to write, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> an answer? Well, if you can<hi rend="italic">not</hi>, I will answer. Do not forget me. My love and my Wife&#x2019;s to your good Lady to your Brother and all friends. Tell me what you do; what your world does.

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>About a week ago, I finished my Second Volume. It was my purpose on that occasion to surprise you with a visit at the India House: but I heard two days before that you were gone to Brighton; a thing I was glad and sad at. For almost a fortnight before that, I had been kept prisoner by a cold, and could not get to you.

<p>I was lately within wind of the India House; yet could not get so far. I think I have not seen you with eyes since that morning in Smithfield? No: you were here since that; but even this is many weeks ago. Were the East-wind over, we shall expect to see you some evening very soon. At six is tea: except Tuesday next, I know not that we are to be from home any night this fortnight.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am afraid you begin to think us rather negligent: at all events you have good right to be impatient to get some news from us; for since Jack&#x2019;s Letter, announci<supplied>[ng ha]</supplied>stily nothing or little more than that he was arrived, you have not received the smallest scrape of a pen from us,&#x2014;if it were not the two scrapes on the back of the Newspaper. It should not have been so. But the matter went as matters often go: I thought Jack would write, having less to do than I; Jack thought probably I would write: and thus as the old Proverb teaches, &#x201C;between two stools, the unfortunate sitter came to the floor.&#x201D; Whether Jack will write today I cannot tell, tho&#x2019; I have urged him: but one thing I can tell, that I will write. None of us are going to any Church, and it seems to me I <supplied>[cou]</supplied>ld not readily find better employment.</p>
<p>The truth is, there was hitherto almost nothing definite to be written. Jack has been flying about here, as you can fancy him: entirely uncertain this day what he would do the next; speaking about doing all things under the Moon and above it; but with no means of forming any positive plan for the future. It is to a good degree the like case with us all. As to setting up as Doctor in London, the difficulties are evidently great; they are great as to setting up anywhere: till a man greatly, and even desperately set his face against them, there is no use in his <hi rend="italic">pretending</hi> to determine. Now, however, I begin to conjecture that there is a <supplied>[sma]</supplied>ll fibre of certainty in our brave Doctor&#x2019;s schem<supplied>[e:]</supplied> he has written to Lady Clare, asking whether she would have him go back to Rome with her on the old footing (the Munich one, of living in his own room &#x26;c) for a short time: with a view to his trying yet a while whether he could not manage to get into practice in Rome rather than London. He wished to know this before going farther; it was a kind of guidance to him to know even that she would <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. Well, yesterday the Lady answers by a Letter (for she is in the country at present) that she <hi rend="italic">will</hi> with great readiness make such an engagement; a six-months engagement, beginning from the <date when="1836-09-01">first of September</date>; so that after <date when="1837-03-00">March next</date> the Doctor shall find himself brought to Rome; and left ready to do all there that may then seem good to him.&#x2014; My own private conjecture, tho&#x2019; nothing yet has been seriously said even among ourselves about it, is that the <pb id="pg-08-342" n="08:342"/>man will <hi rend="italic">accept;</hi> that we shall have him among us till <date when="1836-09-00">September</date>; and that, after that, he will off again to Italy, were it only as a kind of <hi rend="italic">furlough</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">save</hi> him yet another year or so from the necessity of making any final decision. All things considered, which I see in him and in his position here, I am not sure but it is the wisest; tho&#x2019; I carefully abs<supplied>[tain]</supplied> from giving any positive counsel, where it were so easy for a third party to be mistaken. Another prediction I hazard in consequence: that you will before very long see him yourself in Scotland. He speaks often about it: about &#x201C;going off next week&#x201D; &#x26;c: but I do think that had he this business <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> in any way he will go; till it is settled, he naturally ought not to think of going. For the rest, the good Doyle is the same guileless affectionate soul he ever was; and very comfortable to us here: he <supplied>[him]</supplied>self too, flying at large hither and thither &#x201C;over this large and populous city,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350130-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, [<date when="1835-01-30">30 Jan. 1835</date>]</ref>.</note> seems not to be unhappy at all; but to mend in flesh, and on the whole do very handsomely. It is long very long since I have seen him generally cheerfuller.&#x2014; But on the whole, why do I fill my paper with his affairs? He is writing, or will write; and himself explain them.</p>
<p>By way of farther excuse for our delays, I ought to add that for the last ten days especially we have <supplied>[been]</supplied> a good deal put about by the sickliness, natural to this season. Jane has been usually but <foreign>feckless</foreign> [weak]: tho&#x2019;, only one day very ill (with headache it was): then our Servant Anne fell ill and very ill; not even Jack and I but got our colds, and have gone about sniftering and barking; tho&#x2019; all is better now. It was one of the ugliest springs I ever anywhere beheld; the worst within man&#x2019;s memory the people here say: Cold as charity, bitter, biting, barren; till within these five or six days, when it has all at once grown warm and delightful and put out our fires. That this sort of weather had a good deal to do with our sickness, I think very probable. At any rate that business of Anne Cook&#x2019;s threatened really for a day or two to prove very bad: she had some sort of <hi rend="italic">Natural illness</hi> (I believe) which had been too long delayed; she was also said to be the greatest <foreign><hi rend="italic">haveril</hi></foreign> [simpleton] and foolishe<supplied>[st]</supplied> deceiving and self-deceiving <foreign><hi rend="italic">gomeril</hi></foreign> [idiot] in the world: so Jack had a heavy handful doctoring her, bleeding, physicking, starving from food, restraining from coming out of bed; but some days ago, it seems to be &#x201C;all <hi rend="italic">by</hi>,&#x201D; and the creature is stepping about again; looking indeed better than formerly, tho&#x2019; much paler (her former complexion being that of the Northwest moon, tho&#x2019; not so uniform). A more uncultivated human being has rarely or never come across my path <pb id="pg-08-343" n="08:343"/>than Anne Cook: however, she wants not for natural sagacity; is full of good nature, of robust contentment; take this along with you, and understand that she is swift of work, most ready and most <hi rend="italic">rough</hi> in all things; means no harm, knows little difference between truth and untruth (except the mo<supplied>[men]</supplied>tary convenience, often not even momentary),&#x2014;and you have certainly not the model of servants, yet a <foreign><hi rend="italic">rump of a hizzy</hi></foreign> [raw-boned, awkward wench] who gives you less annoyance than the most do with all their gifts. She talked once of going home (for she has some kind of permanent ailment in the back); and if her stout health go, there is really little left her; but whether now that she is likely to be well and even better than before, she will persist in that, I know not: Jane has taken means to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, if so; and Anne shall be sent honestly back&#x2014;with our good wishes, the poor slut. I rather conjecture she will incline to stick where she is, however.&#x2014; The first opportunity you have, it were good charity to inform her friends about this; they have probably heard something about her being ill, and do not yet know that she is quite well again. The rest of her attainments and graces you will not speak of to them (or to any one) except &#x201C;in the general way,&#x201D; and with healing clauses.&#x2014; There surely is enough about <hi rend="italic">her</hi>.</p>
<p>As to myself, for the last three weeks I have been going what you call <hi rend="italic">bane</hi>-idle [bone-idle]. I finished my second volume then, and determined to have a rest for one week, it was very grand; Jack and I went <foreign>swashing</foreign> [bustling] far and near: but the second week, the <hi rend="italic">bile</hi> declared itself (it had been lying hidden, as I knew, before that); and now this third week, I have had my cold, and been dealing a little in <hi rend="italic">caster</hi> &#x26;c, tho&#x2019; but a little. I meant to resume work last Monday; b<supplied>[ut]</supplied> not only the cold came in the way, there was also a fresh proposal (and entreaty) from Mi<supplied>[ll:]</supplied> write him an Article for his <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>, and get a little ready money by it: which of the two to do I knew not, and yet know not; but rather think I shall stick by my old job till I <supplied>[be]</supplied> done with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>. No rest for me in the world till it be off my hands! I often <supplied>[thi]</supplied>nk it is a great malady and madness this poor Book, which wear me so, and has been so unlucky: yet rather I should say, it is a great happiness, and gives me the completest indifference towards all fretting of fortune, towards much that has haunted me like pale spectres all my life long. With little in my purse, little in my hope, and no very fixed landmark in this Earth I stand serene under the sky, and really have the peaceablest fearlessness towards all men and all things. Such blessing I owe to the poor Book; and therefore will not abuse it, but speak well of it. In some s<supplied>[ix]</supplied> <pb id="pg-08-344" n="08:344"/>months it will be printed and done, and the wo<supplied>[rld]</supplied> all round me once again,&#x2014;much more homelike than it ever before was. The people are all exceedingly good and kind to me; the better and kinder, that I depend little on that, or not at all on it, and could do quite tolerably, with their badness and their indifference. And yet, poor brothers! I like them very well.&#x2014; So fear nothing for me, dear Mother: I will work on: what the great Taskmaster has appointed me, doubt not that; neither is there any other thing properly that I desire. I have not &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">tint</hi></foreign> [lost] heart,&#x201D; not a jot; and so not &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">tint</hi></foreign> <hi rend="italic">a&#x2019;</hi> [lost all].&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340530-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:195</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-30">30 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I do not now know who it is that stands indebted to the other: but as this frank will carry a fraction more of paper, it may take my salutation along with it. What you are about specially at this time I cannot very accurately figure to myself: perhaps going to change your abode for one more convenient in regard to position and cheapness? Or do you stay where you are, now that you know it better?&#x2014; I easily conceive that your Bacon-trade is all winded up before this; and doubtless I was heartily glad to hear that it had not proved altogether unsuccessful. There is a great stir in everything connected with manufacturers at present, and perhaps this ere long may be found to tell upon the Cattle-trade and other Farm-Commerce. But let no man put faith in its lasting! It will, to a surety, <hi rend="italic">be down upon him;</hi> and that with a huge crash in more or fewer months. There is just the same sort of thing going on that went on in the year <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>; and all but blind men may forsee that the issue is not doubtful, but inevitable. Only the day or the month <hi rend="italic">when</hi> is uncertain. So if you are meditating any stroke of trade, I pray you keep this in your eye.</p>
<p>On the whole, what wiser can you do than sit still quietly till it appear whether anything feasible will turn up; or even till it appear that <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> feasible will. I am doing, in one sense, the very same here: the only difference in my favour is that I have work to do (tho&#x2019; no wages for it) in the interim. Keep yourself quiet, my dear Brother; or work cheerfully at whatsoever may offer itself from day to day.

<p>Your whiskey is never done yet, and prime stuff it proves&#x2014;applauded even by Archibald Dunlop (the great Haddington Distiller <pb id="pg-08-346" n="08:346"/>once, now a Manager of a Gin-factory here, such are the turns of fate):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:89</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> Jack and I occasionally brew a glass of it into good toddy, and drink your health. O how beautiful Annandale seems to my mind this summer; but I must not come, I doubt much. There is rest for me nowhere till this <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> end. I will tug <hi rend="italic">it</hi> out therefore: thank Heaven, there is now but one volume to do.&#x2014; I recollect few pleasanter things in my late Life than those arrivals at Catlinns, and the welcome and Jenny&#x2019;s tea. Courage! Who knows but we may drink tea yet, as cheerfully as ever, with water from the wells of the Missouri! One&#x2019;s kettle will boil anywhere; there is a sky over one&#x2019;s head anywhere; and kind nourishing Earth under one&#x2019;s feet.</p>
<p>Jack I rather think will see you face to face soon. He is the old fellow throughout: the same childlike kindliness, brotherly frankness and love, the same <hi rend="italic">fluistering</hi> [flustering], and <hi rend="italic">winged</hi> incoherence of words; he has made me laugh more, one way and the other, than I had done for years in the same space. A good fellow, as ever broke this world&#x2019;s bread; whom we must just let alone to go his own way, and be what he cannot but be.</p>
<p>My Mother has all my news; which she will impart you without drawback.

<salute>My Dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>Your Letter has been here several weeks; a very welcome messenger to us: and I did not think, at the time, I should have been so long in answering it. But I have been drawn hither and thither by many things, of late: besides I judged that Robert and you were happy enough of yourselves for the present; and did not much need any foreign aid or interruption.</p>
<p>I need not assure you, my dear little Jenny, of the interest I took in the great enterprise you had embarked on; of my wishes and prayers that it might prove for the good of both. On the whole, I can say that to my judgement it looks all very fair and well. You know I have all along regard<supplied>[ed]</supplied> Hanning as an uncommonly brisk <foreign>gleg</foreign> [quick] little fellow, since the first time I saw him (hardly longer than my leg then) and prophecied [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] handsome things of him in the world. It is very rare and very fortunate when two parties that have affected each other from childhood upwards get together in indissoluble partnership at last. May it prove well for you; as I think it will! You must take the good and the ill in faithful mutual help; and whoever or whatever fail you, never fail one another. I have no doubt Robert will shift his way with all dexterity and prudence thro&#x2019; that Cotton Babylon looking <hi rend="italic">sharp</hi> about him; knowing always too that &#x201C;honesty is the best policy&#x201D; for all manner of men. Do thou faithfully second him, my <foreign>bairn</foreign>; that will be the best of lots for thee.</p>
<p>I think it possible that now and then, especially when you are left alone, the look of so many foreign things may seem dispiriting to you; and the huge smoke and <foreign><hi rend="italic">stour</hi></foreign> [bustle] of that tumultuous Manchester (which is not unlike the uglier parts of London) produce quite other <pb id="pg-08-348" n="08:348"/>than a pleasant impression. But take courage, my woman: &#x201C;You will <hi rend="italic">use</hi>, you will <hi rend="italic">use&#x201D;;</hi> and get <foreign><hi rend="italic">hefted</hi></foreign> [accustomed] to the place, as all creatures do. There are many good people in that vast weaving-shop, many good things; among the innumerable bad. Keep snug within your own doors, keep your own hearth snug; by and by you will see what is worth venturing out for. Have nothing to do with the foolish, with the vain, and ill-conducted. Attach yourself to the well-living and sensible; to every one from whom you find there is real <hi rend="italic">benefit</hi> derivable. Thus by degrees a desirable little circle will form itself round you; you will feel that Manchester is a <hi rend="italic">home</hi>, as all places under the Heavenly sun may become for one.</p>
<p>In a Newspaper you would notice that the Doctor was come. Till this day almost, there was little else to be said about him than that he was here and well. He has been speculating and inquiring as to what he should do: and now has determined that London practice will not do for the present; that he should go back to Italy with his Lady and try again to get practice there. He is gone out this moment to make a bargain to that effect. They are to set out for Rome again on the <date when="1836-09-01">first of September</date>: from that till the <date when="1837-03-01">first of March</date>, the Doctor is Lady Clare&#x2019;s Doctor, but lives in his own Lodging at Rome: after that he is free to do whatsoever he will; to stay there, if stay seem inviting; to return home, if otherwise. I believe, myself that he has decided wisely. Till <date when="1836-09-00">September</date> then we have him amongst us. He talks of being off &#x201C;in a week or two&#x201D; for Scotland: he charged me to say that he would see Manchester and you either as he went or as he returned: it is not much out of the way, if one go by Carlisle (or rather I suppose it is directly in the way), or even if one go by Liverpool; but I rather think he will make for Newcastle this time; to which place we have a Steamboat direct. This is a good season for Steamboats, and a bad for Coaches, for which latter indeed what <hi rend="italic">good</hi> season is there? Nothing in the world is frightfuller to me, of the travelling sort, than a Coach on a long journey. It were easier by half to walk it with peas (at least <hi rend="italic">boiled</hi> peas) in your shoes,&#x2014;were not the time so much shorter!&#x2014; The Doctor looks very well and <foreign><hi rend="italic">sonsy</hi></foreign> [hearty]; he seems in good health and well to live; the only change is that his head is getting a shade of grey (quite <hi rend="italic">ahead</hi> of mine, tho&#x2019; I am six years older) which does not misseem him but looks <supplied>[ver]</supplied>y well.</p>
<p><supplied>[We]</supplied> had a long speculation about going to Scotland too but I doubt we mu<supplied>[st]</supplied> renounce it, this summer. I have finished my second volume, but there is still the Third to do; and I must have such a tuffle with it! All summer, I will struggle and wrestle; but then about <pb id="pg-08-349" n="08:349"/>the time of the gathering in of sheaves, I too shall be gathering in.&#x2014; Jane has gone out to &#x201C;buy a cotton gown&#x201D;; for the weather is at last beautiful and warm. Before going, she bade me send you both her best wishes and regards, prayers for a happy pilgrimage together. She has been but poorly for a good while (indeed all the world is sick with these East winds and perpetual changes); but will probably be better now. Jack and I too have both had our colds. Then Anne Cook fell sick, almost dangerously sick for the time: but Jack was there, and gave abundant medical help; so the poor creature is on her feet again; and a great burble of confusion is rolled out of doors thereby.</p>
<p>I am writing to our Mother this day. I have heard nothing from that quarter since the Letter that informed me the poor little child was dead. Jean wrote part of it herself, and seemed in a very composed state, keeping her natural sorrow courageously down. Our Mother I believe continues there till Jean be <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> again, and we hope happily <hi rend="italic">well</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >With the birth of her second child, James Carlyle Aitken, sometime in <date when="1836-05-00">May</date> or early <date when="1836-06-00">June</date>.</note></p>
<p>Whether there may be a frank procurable today I know not; but I will try. At worst I will not wait lest you grow impatient again and get <hi rend="italic">short</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360118-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1836-01-18">18 Jan.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; If you knew what a <hi rend="italic">fizz</hi> I am kept in, with one thing and another! Write to me when you have time to fill a sheet: news, descriptions of how you get on, what you suffer and enjoy, what you <hi rend="italic">do;</hi> these are the best. I will answer. Send an old Newspaper from time to time with two strokes on it, if you are well. Promise however to write <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi> if you are ill! Then shall we know to keep ourselves in peace. Farewell dear little Sister! Give our love to our new Brother; tell him to walk wisely and be a credit to your choice. <closer><salute>God be with you both!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Letters, for the <hi rend="italic">Hist. Parl.;</hi> for all your kind messages and attentions to me. I meant to have been at the India House, or somehow to have met you, long before this; but a miserable <pb id="pg-08-350" n="08:350"/><hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi> (with a blessing to it!) keeps me pining mostly at home; incapable oftenest even of forming a resolution. And you too are sickly; and your Father&#x2019;s house is in distress.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Mill was dying and Mill had been in Brighton convalescing (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360118-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1836-01-18">18 Jan.</date></ref>).</note> Things go not well with us. We must wait and <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>. One of these days you shall surely see me in one way or another: this despicability of a disorder is promising to abate.</p>
<p>The foreign Packet charged &#xa3;5<hi rend="superscript">..</hi>18<hi rend="superscript">..</hi>0 presented itself the day after your Note. By a Letter that come along with it, I learned that it was&#x2014;what think you? A pamphlet of Dr Channing&#x2019;s on Slavery<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Slavery</hi> (Boston, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>).</note> (or some such thing), and the American Edition of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh!</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> (Boston, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>) with an unsigned preface by Emerson. In his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<date when="1836-06-01">1 June</date>) Carlyle notes: &#x201C;Edition of Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh, very prettily printed, from Boston. &#x2026; How curious; almost pathetic! But one need not dwell on it.&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> Instantaneous rejection to the Dead Letter Office was inevitable. Next day my Brother called on Freeling<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Francis Freeling (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), Secretary of the General Post Office in London.</note> or some of his people; they offered him the Packet for ten shillings: but 3/6 was the maximum of my commission to him; so Teufel<hi rend="italic">k</hi> lies dormant, very singularly again, waiting his new destinies; never to be liberated by <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<date when="1836-06-01">1 June</date>) Carlyle notes: &#x201C;Jack went himself the day before yesterday, and gave it, and left the Book here.&#x201D;</note> I cannot but laugh at the whole matter, it looks so confused and absurd.</p>
<p>What to say of <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau?</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires biographiques;</hi> see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341028-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:325</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-10-28">28 Oct. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> I spread the Book all down before me, after your Brighton Letter;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> twice attempted to fasten on it, twice failed: <foreign><hi rend="italic">bis patriae cecidere manus</hi></foreign> [twice have my hands failed my country]!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> It seems as if there were but one blessedness for me in the world, that of getting <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with this fatal History of mine: the thought that one day I shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have it weighing down the life of me is like a prophecy of resurrection. And yet I am unjust to the poor Book. It enables me, it mainly, to sit all this while in the quietest defiance I have ever felt of a whole world so contradictory and menacing; awaiting the issue really with a kind of indifference that astonishes myself. Your last Note brings the thing again to the judgement seat. I will see you before deciding irrevocably. Indeed till this coughing and pining abate, I ought to decide nothing.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-351" n="08:351"/>Pray do not take the trouble of sending any more Newspapers to Mott&#x2019;s.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> When you are writing to me, or when I see you, give me three of the latest you have at hand: I have a use for them (I send them to my Mother and Friends instead of Letters); but there are quite enough for that: and as to reading of Newspapers I find Fonblanque<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As editor of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>.</note> to have become again quite abundant for me.</p>
<p>John is very impatient to meet you; and will go I think himself, if I do not accompany him very soon.</p>
<p>I am in great haste; my wife waiting for me. Surely I have forgotten two or three things.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>You are very good: do not mind what I wrote to you; or fret yourself thinking that it is a &#x201C;favour&#x201D; to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and not twice as much a favour to myself.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill&#x2019;s reply to Carlyle&#x2019;s letter of complaint about &#x201C;Mirabeau,&#x201D; [<date when="1836-06-02">2 June</date>], has not been found.</note></p>
<p>The best is, I am pouring out all manner of watery stuff; and hope to have a kind of readable enough Article ready about the time specified, after all. Of what quantity I cannot say; but it promises to be very considerable. Wait then till we see! There are thirteen good days before Saturday come a week, and the west wind is blowing.&#x2014; For the rest, I have got an enormous white hat, broader than any Quaker&#x2019;s in London; which is a great comfort; the Public happily not objecting much to my avoiding headaches in that way,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it gives me the most Preadamite air, and is indeed ugly and ugly-making to a pitch. My wife has stipulated almost with tears that I shall never wear it &#x201C;in her sight&#x201D;; a condition which I observe.</p>
<p>When you write next, send me three old Newspapers, and special word how you are, and how your Father is.</p>
<p>I have heard nothing of my Brother since Tuesday morning when I saw him mount into the Hull Steamer.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I had a long conversation with Mr Talfourd; whom I found to be a most polite humane man; exceedingly well disposed towards you.</p>
<p>After much frank communication, both of us agreed that of the two Schemes the one suggested by Jeffrey did seem the hopefuller; that as both could not be followed, this latter must for the present be exclusively aimed at,&#x2014;in the track and by the methods which Mr Talfourd and other Friends had already decided on.</p>
<p>The grand point for the moment being that you should have the means of meeting this existing perplexity, I took pains to ascertain how you were to act so that the result (of getting money to pay the debt, tomorrow morning) might be <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;infallible.&#x201D;</hi> This was the manner of procedure.</p>
<p>That you were to call at Mr Foster&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster: see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320215-TC-GE-01"><sic>6:118</sic><corr>TC to GE, <date when="1832-02-15">15 Feb. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> tomorrow at 10 o&#x2019;clock; when Mr F., furnished with Lord Melbourne&#x2019;s Letter and instructions how to act, would go with you, and get what money (&#xa3;35 or &#xa3;40) might be needful; the remainder to be put into some Bank, to lie there as a nucleus for the Subscription, which ought thereupon to be directly proceeded with.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Bowring had presented Lord Melbourne with a petition signed by at least twenty M.P.&#x2019;s in favor of a pension for Hunt. This was rejected, apparently because &#x201C;Melbourne considered it proper for no man to have a pension given him by one sovereign, who had been condemned in a court of law for opposing another&#x201D; (Leigh Hunt, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi>, ed. J. Morpurgo, p. 443). But the money which Melbourne was to give, mentioned here, may well have been the &#xa3;200 from the Royal Bounty Fund that Hunt mentions receiving &#x201C;during the reign of King William&#x201D; (ibid.). Presumably Jeffrey&#x2019;s suggestion was that the sum be added to by Hunt&#x2019;s friends, Talfourd, Forster, Carlyle, Mill, etc., who had been working to get him a pension.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-08-354" n="08:354"/>Knowing the pressure of the case, and to secure &#x201C;infallibility,&#x201D; I obtained farther that if you missed Mr Foster, or if by any accident Mr Foster and you could not obtain the money, then Mr Talfourd (who, or some substitute for him, was to be at the Court of Common Pleas) would himself advance the money on the security of that Letter.</p>
<p>I am in great haste. I write this down that the servant may convey it to you, at 6 tomorrow morning. There was nothing more to be said, even if I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> seen you tonight. <closer><salute>Good night my dear Sir,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Here is the remainder of that <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau;</hi> which, by the great blessing of Heaven, I got done with, last night. May you like it! (as the Hostesses say), or tolerate it!</p>
<p>Can you send me the Newspaper which contains Melbourne&#x2019;s Norton-Trial?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Elizabeth Norton, <foreign>n&#xE9;e</foreign> Sheridan (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">77</date>), poet, and granddaughter of Richard Brinsley Sheridan; unhappily married to George Norton since <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>, she had met Lord Melbourne in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> in seeking employment for her husband. In <date when="1836-03-00">March</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-04-00">April</date> Norton had seized their children, turned Caroline out of the house, and accused her of adultery with Melbourne. The trial had taken place on <date when="1836-06-22">22 June</date>, with neither Melbourne nor Caroline present. Sir John Campbell, Attorney General, for the defence, obtained an acquittal without the jury&#x2019;s having to retire. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, <date when="1836-06-22">22</date> and <date when="1836-06-23">23 June</date>, contained full reports. Mrs. Norton later used her experience of being subjected to her husband&#x2019;s demands about the children and her earnings as evidence in the campaign for changes in the legal status of married women.</note> This with the D<hi rend="italic">d Necklace</hi> if you have done with it.</p>
<p>I fear there is little improvement at Kensington,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to James Mill&#x2019;s and John Stuart&#x2019;s illness; they had moved to Vicarage Place, Church St., Kensington, in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>.</note> little perceptible in yourself. I too have seldom in my life felt sicklier than now. We must hold on!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I received with great satisfaction first your Newspaper from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; then Alick&#x2019;s from Annan, announcing your arrival there; and finally your long full and instructive Letter;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1836-06-15">15 June</date>.</note> to which I have already promised an answer &#x201C;within the week.&#x201D; My purpose is, you see, to make good this engagement: good it may be made, and that will be all; for I am two days belated with the work I was at, and the week is on its last legs.</p>
<p>We had begun to wonder, rather uneasily, whither and how you had fared, when the first Newspaper came. It seemed likely you might make a longer stay in Edin<hi rend="italic">r:</hi> but I can easily fancy all the contradiction you would experience in that poor hide-bound Athens, and how in a very few days, you might feel that it was exhausted for you, and brave Annandale remaining, still to break open. You do not speak of seeing Mitchell; I fear, poor fellow, there was little hopeful or joyful to be seen about him.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1836-07-11">11 July</date> John replies that he saw Robert Mitchell &#x201C;four or five times while in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. &#x2026; The first time I called he spoke of the hopelessness of his disease.&#x201D; He died on <date when="1836-07-10">10 July</date>. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140430-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:6</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1814-04-30">30 April 1814</date></corr></ref>.</note> Gordon<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gordon had apparently written to Carlyle. John wrote of him, on <date when="1836-06-15">15 June</date>, &#x201C;Gordon &#x26; his wife were very friendly. &#x2026; She resembles Mrs Jeffrey of Girthon in manner and conversation. Gordon told me in her presence that he owed her to the feeling of solitude and forsakenness that he felt after you left <supplied>[for]</supplied> London. They do very well together.&#x201D;</note> seemed to say, the Doctors had given him up: he is often in my thoughts since that sad announcement. Or did you step out to Haddington? I think always of the worthy Johnston<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John also explained that he had heard of Johnston from Mitchell, who had seen him recently, and that he looked &#x201C;contented and well.&#x201D; James Johnston&#x2019;s wife, Jenny, had died in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, leaving him with two children. See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341028-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:330</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-10-28">28 Oct. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> with a very peculiarly kind feeling. He too <foreign><hi rend="italic">erduldet das Schicksal</hi></foreign> [endures his destiny]; but in a gentle humble way, so far, far from me; I often from these stormy granite ridges cast a look into his little distant nest, and wish him with my whole heart well.</p>
<p>It was quite a new notion to me, and very comfortable, that you found Alick living on the Hill; and not without some kind of satisfactory employment. I remember the brave little cottage very well;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick now lived at the Hill, Annan, a house that Mrs. Irving of Bogside had once lived in.</note> and think I should like much to stay and sea-bathe there for six <pb id="pg-08-356" n="08:356"/>weeks; looking out silent, upon the silent Cumberland Mountains: but alas <foreign>bairn</foreign>&#x2014;! Tell Alick to be still and steadfast, quiet, nay as <hi rend="italic">cheerful</hi> as one can: &#x201C;A merry heart goes all the day,&#x2014;A sad one tires in a mile-a.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</hi>, IV, iii.</note> You have confused me as to Mary&#x2019;s house &#x201C;in George <hi rend="italic">Square</hi>.&#x201D; Did they also remove at Whitsunday somewhither? Or is their house still the one I know, at the corner of Wellington-Street, not far from that of George <hi rend="italic">Street?</hi> There is no <hi rend="italic">Square</hi>, I believe, in Annan town.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had made the same mistake when Mary had moved to this new house: see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June 1835</date></ref>.</note> I am right glad to hear that they continue to struggle on, not without success.&#x2014; The news are good from Dumfries too, and from Scotsbrig. How well our dear Mother seems to hold out against change and weather! Have we not great reason to rejoice in this blessing, what crosses soever beset us elsewhere? I fancy you at Scotsbrig; leading the delightfullest idle life,&#x2014;not so delightful to you, naturally, as it were to me. Yet Summer greenness and the breath of the West is good,&#x2014;among those we love best in the world! Pray enjoy your <hi rend="italic">Sabbath-weeks;</hi> preparatory to new effort. Rome will be brighter of sky: but it will want much that you have there.&#x2014; Tell me how our Mother <hi rend="italic">does</hi> now that Jenny is gone; how she works and lives, and adjusts herself. I remember the two little rooms: the Saddle hanging on its <foreign><hi rend="italic">nog</hi></foreign> [peg] (<foreign><hi rend="italic">knochen?</hi></foreign>)<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is suggesting that &#x201C;<foreign>nog</foreign>&#x201D; derives from &#x201C;<foreign>knochen</foreign>&#x201D; [bone].</note> with a Newspaper over it, and all the pots and pans. No King&#x2019;s Palace in this world is worth half so much to me as that little room. Do you ride; has Jamie the dwarf-carthorse? You will go to Kirkchrist I suppose?<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To see the Church family. John met them in Dumfries, &#x201C;Old Mr &#x26; Mrs C., James from India and John who is sub-factor to Duke of Buccleuch at Langholm. The old people were looking well, James thick and fat &#x26; abounding in money &#x26; good nature. Eleanor has been at Calcutta likewise &#x26; is home again.&#x201D;</note> Mrs Welsh expects you and my Mother up with <hi rend="italic">her</hi>. It will be better to take a Gig in that expedition; and I think you will have a pretty drive. Mrs W. expresses herself in very high terms indeed about a certain Doctor of our acquaintance. The Liverpool children are with her, or to be with her; and I think, the Father John along with them for a little. It is not impossible but Mrs Welsh may resolve on coming up hither with you: Jane, I doubt, will hardly get to her, tho&#x2019; she occasionally speculates about it: a certain Mrs Crichton of Dabton,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Thomas Crichton, born Murray, married <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>, died <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>; see also <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370304-JWC-JWE-01">JWC to JW, <date when="1837-03-04">4 March 1837</date></ref>.</note> is here and soon returning; &#x201C;If I should go with her?&#x201D; Jane says. But it will not be; the heart will <pb id="pg-08-357" n="08:357"/>fail.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1836-07-11">11 July</date> John wrote that Mrs. Welsh was &#x201C;disappointed at Jane&#x2019;s not coming with Mrs Crighton who had just arrived.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; Have you been to Dumfries again? Have you heard any word of Jenny?<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had told Carlyle, on <date when="1836-06-15">15 June</date>, that &#x201C;it was most fortunate that I did not come by Manchester as Jenny and her husband were both in Dumfriesshire at the time I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have passed. They went back only about ten days ago. &#x2026; They were absent fr Manch<hi rend="italic">r</hi> during the time of the races when nothing is done in their way.&#x201D;</note> I sent a Letter to Manchester while you were here; requesting a Newspaper at least: none has yet come: I could like to know that mine had arrived, that the poor young creatures were well.&#x2014; But now for a touch at my own History since we parted! Forgive much! Worse <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> a man seldom had,&#x2014;such is the march of intellect in these times.</p>
<p>I made little by my breakfast with Morris<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Denison Maurice: see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-JWC-JOST-01">JWC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June 1835</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01">JWC to JCA, [<date when="1835-08-00">mid-Aug. 1835</date>]</ref>.</note> that morning: had to wait an hour and a half, by the clock, in philosophical conversation, which had been much more agreeably spent in silence; and then&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">joot</hi></foreign> of tea [cup of weak tea], with continued philosophical conversation: with great kindness however.

<p>Working at this thing so closely, dear Jack, I can have seen or suffered little apart from it. There has been no arrival of importance, human or scriptory.

<p>The very day you went off, there came hither an ill-starred old Italian Dam<supplied>[e]</supplied><note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Beatrice Novelli.</note> who made us regret you much. She was sent by Pepoli. A bred-looking, almost stately woman of perhaps five-and-forty, who has once been beautiful: she is driven from Bologna (her native place is Ancona) for some aid lent in the Radical Correspondences (Letters sent under cover to her, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lettere di donne</hi></foreign> [women&#x2019;s letters] being respected usually at the Post office), she came to Paris with her husband and daughter; has <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> both of them by death and all her fortune, heart and faculty; has come over to England, by the maddest advice of somebody or other; and now <foreign><hi rend="italic">daunders</hi></foreign> [wanders] about here, without penny in the purse, plan in the head, friend alive in the world, or even a word that she can <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> to anybody:&#x2014;the most helpless, melancholy forlorn figure I ever beheld with eyes. What to do with her? Jane thinks she will drown herself in the Thames: for she is a proud body, I see, and ashamed to beg tho&#x2019; unable to dig. She could once &#x201C;embroider&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c: but has now &#x201C;wept her eyes out,&#x201D; <pb id="pg-08-359" n="08:359"/>and cannot see to do it. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ah cieux</hi></foreign> [Heavens]!&#x201D; said Cavaignac: <foreign><hi rend="italic">si cette femme l&#xE0; f&#xFB;t votre m&#xE8;re, par example</hi></foreign> [if that woman were your mother, for example]!&#x201D; If your Mother were left like that woman! Jane runs doing what she can; has interested this one and that one; will get money &#x26;c lady&#x2019;s-maidship &#x26;c: the poor body is a very miserable, unaidable distressing object to me.</p>
<p>A few days after you went, there met me, on one of the streets here, coming hither, Dr Beattie,&#x2014;and the renowned &#x201C;Captain <hi rend="italic">Huzbie,&#x201D;</hi> Esbie!<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. William Beattie (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341120-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:336</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-11-20">20 Nov. 1834</date></corr></ref>); &#x201C;Squire&#x201D; Esbie (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18181127-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:149</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1818-11-27">27 Nov. 1818</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211109-TC-AC-01"><sic>391</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-11-09">9 Nov. 1821</date></corr></ref>).</note> The creature is grown old, atrabiliar; vain as ever, drier than ever, dry now and barren as the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ling</hi></foreign> [heather or moorland grass] of last year. He was for Paris: he has been there, and came back to me (the other morning), to waste an hour of my time and a portion of my patience: I fear I was cruel to him; yet how could one help it? There is not a gleam of sympathy with any generous thing in that unfortunate heart; and its very selfishness has now got black and miserable; vanity, Lucifer&#x2019;s vanity (beg pardon of Lucifer!) <hi rend="italic">burnt out,</hi> and become sour-smoking ashes. A more unpleasant object than this poor man (whom I pitied too in the bottom of my heart) could hardly be offered me to view. He is to go next week: I hope to kinder destinies;&#x2014;and that I have seen the last of him for this bout.</p>
<p>Mill&#x2019;s Father is now understood in his own family to be dying. They seem to have reconciled themselves to it: he is thought (by scandal) to have been a very rigid not to say cruel man to his own; I should rather say, very ill-vested and very resolute methodic;&#x2014;it seems to me he is one whom his own people might love much more than the world did. I confess I feel a real sorrow to think of him; slowly sinking there.&#x2014; John Mill himself is no better: I have seen him just once: he looks preoccupied, hampered, very miserable; yet solicits accepts no sympathy from you; a man cased up (against his own will) in the miserablest impenetrable coating of stone and ice. I love very truly the Abstract-idea of him: but the Abstract-idea of him is all you can get; were the man himself never so near you, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> remains unattainable.</p>
<p>John Sterling continues tolerably improving; indeed, looks as well nearly as I ever saw him do. They have ordered him to ride; which he does daily. He came down here, one day, as he sometimes does again; to take Jane up with him to pass the afternoon and evening: he surrendered his fine horse to me, accordingly; and I had the most illustrious excursion, by trot, canter and gallop, far and wide; and <pb id="pg-08-360" n="08:360"/>returned to him in the evening thro&#x2019; Hyde Park, considerably comforted, to fetch Jane back. He is for Bourdeaux, he rather thinks now; certainly for Bourdeaux <hi rend="italic">first:</hi> and will go about the <date when="1836-08-01">first of August</date>, to leave time for Rome still, if needful. I am heartily sorry to part with him; he is the friendliest being I have met in the world for long years: I always fear, too good for the world!&#x2014; Of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stimabile</hi></foreign><note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Sterling.</note> we see nothing here, and not much anywhere, tho&#x2019; he is always brisk and blithe. Jane and he never seem to meet now without sharp fencing and cutting. Poor &#x201C;Werter of sixty.&#x201D;! It is a fast-changing world this; and Today nowhere consents to be Yesterday or Tomorrow.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">degli Antoni</hi><note n="24" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June 1835</date></ref>.</note> is very sick, of <hi rend="italic">influenza;</hi> confined to her room these several weeks: none of us have got thither; tho&#x2019; I often pity the poor dame. We were at her Concert;<note n="25" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1836-05-30">30 May</date> at the Concert Room, King&#x2019;s Theatre. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> (<date when="1836-05-31">31 May</date>) reviewed it thus: &#x201C;Madame Degli Antonj [sic] collected a very numerous and fashionable audience here yesterday morning, by some very adequate attractions. Few foreign artists can boast of a greater share of public patronage &#x2026; which &#x2026; she very justly deserves.&#x201D;</note> she sang, and looked, dimly, in the distance. Jane was led thro&#x2019; secret Opera-house passages to see her, and shriek into her arms: I remained in my place. Since that (some one else, perhaps one of the Frenchmen, giving me a Ticket) I went to hear an Italian <foreign><hi rend="italic">Improvisatore</hi></foreign> [Improviser]! He is called Pestrucci;<note n="26" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Filippo Pistrucci, artist and <foreign>Improvisatore</foreign>, brother of Benedetto Pistrucci, medalist to the Mint, and father of Scipione (ca. <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>), friend and collaborator of Mazzini. He become secretary and then director of Mazzini&#x2019;s Free Italian School, founded <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, at 5 Greville Street. Author of <hi rend="italic">Iconology</hi> (London, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>), <hi rend="italic">Manfredi</hi> (London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>) and other works. Carlyle possibly attended an earlier, untraced performance, but the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> (<date when="1836-06-24">24 June</date>) refers to his &#x201C;well-known gift in improvisation&#x201D; at a concert in Hanover Square Rooms, <date when="1836-06-23">23 June</date>.</note> a Roman, but in bad odour there, owing to his Carbonarism and Friendship-for-Humanity.
A man of sixty; with a thin wooden face (of the type of your Engraver&#x2019;s) and nose <hi rend="italic">with a middle-cartilage</hi> (do you know that particular turn of the nostrils&#x2014;expressive of ineffectual audacity, and toil that has not profited?)&#x2014;a tuft of grey hair as if <hi rend="italic">flung</hi> upon the scalp of him; long stalking legs, small body; grey, simple-vehement eyes: this is our Pestrucci. He strode and stalked, raked anxiously his fingers thro&#x2019; the grey tuft, clasped his temples, sprawled, and got clear with sweat and stew; chaunting in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Cantofermo</hi></foreign> [plain chant] fashion (really not unlike old Lizzy Herd<note n="27" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a member of one of the churches attended by the Carlyle family.</note> reading the Scripture); and produced&#x2014;the day of small things.<note n="28" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Zech. 4:10.</note> I understood <pb id="pg-08-361" n="08:361"/>the most of it;&#x2014;enough of it: but was interested in the poor old lean man chaunting and wriggling for a livelihood there, far from home.&#x2014; We were also at the French Theatre one night; Cavaignac despatched his messenger with a Ticket, and we had to go. Worth while for once! They were acting <hi rend="italic">Figaro;</hi> one Monrose,<note n="29" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Monrose, stage name of Claude Louis S&#xE9;raphin Barizain (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), member of the Com&#xE9;die Fran&#x26;ccedil;aise since <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>, particularly noted for his Figaro. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> (<date when="1836-05-31">31 May</date>) reviewed his performance: &#x201C;Beaumarchais&#x2019;s admirable comedy <hi rend="italic">Le Barbier de Seville</hi> was performed at the St. James&#x2019;s Theatre last evening, for the <foreign><hi rend="italic">d&#xE9;but</hi></foreign> of M. Monrose &#x2026; He is an excellent comic actor, possessing an exuberant flow of animal spirits without being in the least degree boisterous or coarse.&#x201D;</note> from Paris direct, was Figaro; considerably the best comic actor I have ever seen. A fine looking man of fifty; with a fine French face, of the bushy-eyebrowed, black-eyed broad-nostrilled sort: a great deal of hidden-satire in him, and quick insight. Our <foreign><hi rend="italic">Loge</hi></foreign> [box] was a hot hen-coop, in which anything bigger than a Bantam could not have felt comfortable. There was headache and fatigue; and a day lamed for work:&#x2014;not to be repeated.</p>
<p>Why do I babble all these things to a judicious Doctor? Let me add, however, that I have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> my white Hat! A most noble broad brim; price 6/6: of great comfort to me; and this not by the brim alone, I find, but also by the size, which lets in the air about me, and prevents the intrusion of headache: I find my last three or four Hats have been far too little. Jane shrieked, nay almost literally <foreign><hi rend="italic">grat</hi></foreign> [wept], when she first saw me in such headgear: however, I persisted (resolute against head<hi rend="italic">ache</hi>); and she now says I do very well in it. Cockneydom happily does not seem to mind me at all, tho&#x2019; probably there is not such another beaver within the four ports of London.&#x2014; Let me mention also that we had Liston<note n="30" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Robert Liston (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280327-TC-JWC-01"><sic>4:347</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1828-03-27">27 March 1828</date></corr></ref>).</note> here, Liston the Surgeon. He came one evening to see Jane, when all was confusion, Jane lying very sick: he is of enormous size, with bald worn-looking head; a great flatsoled Scotch fellow with much stuff in him, whom I considerably like.&#x2014; The Frenchmen come here; especially Cavaignac, rather often, and now with strange <hi rend="italic">English</hi> in his mouth. There is a great lolloping <hi rend="italic">schoolboy</hi> character and fresh French Nature in this C.&#x2014;and I can do very tolerably with him of an evening. He seems to abound in cash; in want of hope and aim: unhappy enough; with wild bursts of affection and <foreign><hi rend="italic">bonhommie;</hi></foreign> French and yet honest and artless: a wild <foreign><hi rend="italic">cameral</hi></foreign> [large, awkward creature], son of the woods! We have talked about <pb id="pg-08-362" n="08:362"/>Religion too; and he is not so barren there as one thinks. Let him pass in peace, for the time our two roads lie in sight of each other!</p>
<p>But to wind up now, I say that the Garden must be sorted, which is getting very rank. The Doil crop of turnips<note n="31" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Turnips planted by John, one of whose nicknames was Doil.</note> flourishes amazingly,&#x2014;struck by the fly, a little; and will have actual bulbs in a few days. Beans, Mignonette and all the rest, are growing and stretching in the most vagrant manner. It will take me two days. After <hi rend="italic">which</hi> there remains&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">The Revolution</hi> again. Health or sober strength is not to be thought of till I get done with that. But I purpose to write far <hi rend="italic">faster</hi> at it; being really in a rage with it, in a scorn and contemptuous indignation at it. There is (<foreign><hi rend="italic">hoffentlich</hi></foreign> [hopeful]) strength in me to do it. And after that, I will most surely have <hi rend="italic">a rest</hi>, if there be rest in the world.&#x2014; It is a great blessing for me however that we have such a summer. I have yet suffered nothing at all by the heat (tho&#x2019; I should fear the country must be suffering, for there has <hi rend="italic">been</hi> no heat), and we have a little sprinkling of shower almost daily.</p>
<p>But now dear Jack what of thyself? When are we to meet here; when is a Letter to come? Let the Letter not delay, at any rate! As for the meeting, I can advise nothing; what I wish thou knowest: it seems cruel to advise any one to exchange simplicity and leafy Annandale against this infamous Brick Sahara, tho&#x2019; there is a Brother in it. The red Bed stands in its place. Be happy, my brave fellow; and do what will make thee happiest.&#x2014; What if I should walk across the world; and come to you in Rome, next year, with the knapsack on my back! There is nothing <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>, nothing impossible, if a man will but bestir himself. This Brick Sahara is not hateful to me at bottom, but hateful-loveable; and perhaps one day I shall thank it much.&#x2014; Give my brotherly heart&#x2019;s love to all our Brothers and Sisters, by name every one, for I remember them all. Tell Isabella, her cheese shall be broken up solemnly when you return: we trust it will do honour to the maker.&#x2014; It is a very glad thing to me that my Mother will go to Manchester with you. I meant to write a scrap of my feelings to her on a scrap of paper by this cover: yet at bottom what had I to say, which she will not read here, or suppose as well? Jane is gone out, but left &#x201C;abundant love to you all.&#x201D; I covet greatly the fresh air, and will go too. Write almost <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi>. I will send you a Newspaper probably on Monday.&#x2014; <closer><salute>May God keep my Mother and all of you! <hi rend="italic">Amen!</hi></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>After a frank from me so very lately, there is some risk of your getting almost a fright with this. Fear nothing; nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>The night before last our Threepenny handed us in that Letter from Lady Clare; announcing that she goes off a fortnight earlier. Whether it was worth while getting a frank for that, you may question; but that is the sole matter. We calculate that it may expedite you out of Annandale: at all events, it seems good that you know it.</p>
<p>The von Stettens were not at home when I called that day: they sent the inclosed Answer,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Tavistock Hotel, dated <date when="1836-06-26">26 June</date>.</note> full of German politeness; which was probably, in the present hot <hi rend="italic">biliary</hi> weather, &#x201C;just as well.&#x201D; Yet they were good people, to judge by the look; and I shall really be glad if they come, especially <hi rend="italic">you</hi> being here.</p>
<p>Jane is not at all well, any more than when you were here. Mrs Austin talks of a voyage to Boulogne for her; but from <hi rend="italic">that</hi> quarter I have never yet seen much help come. This morning I was talking to Jane about her going to Templand for a few weeks; but she takes no hold of that. Her ailment is being <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> far too often (I mean as women are sick): but that I judge to be the symptom only. Dispiritment, weakness, hot weather.&#x2014; The Sterlings (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Stimabiles</hi></foreign>) have asked her to go to Paris with them in August; which she has undertaken to do: this she says instead of Templand will set her up. Would to Heaven it might!</p>
<p>I have cleaned out the Garden, which looks very tolerable, waiting for you. Today therefore I must begin my task. I have swallowed a pill, a quarter of an hour ago, tho&#x2019; it is yet but morning: infer that I am out of order still. Yet these two days of toil have stilled the mind of me not a little: I am far better now; at worst mournful, not indignant and rabid. One strong last pull and that weariest of all things is done. The thought that I am now in the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> stage of it, every word advancing to the end, makes me bound again. Courage, Courage!</p>
<p>This morning there came a pack of Letters from the writer Lamond,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Allan Lamond; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331213-TC-AG-01"><sic>7:51</sic><corr>TC to AG, <date when="1833-12-13">13 Dec. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> the friend of poor Glen at Glasgow: Letters from Glen to his Brother. To me they do not seem very different from the old sort; tho&#x2019; <pb id="pg-08-364" n="08:364"/>this Lamond sees rather better hopes in them.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1836-07-11">11 July</date> John said, &#x201C;I saw John Austin &#x26; asked about Glen, and found there was little change in him. He bathes in Loch Orr, wanders about som<supplied>[etimes]</supplied> gesticulating violently when alone in the fields.&#x201D;</note> Have you any thought of riding up as far to see the poor fellow? You would get little good of him; yet you would see him and satisfy yourself.</p>
<p>James Mill is gone the way of man. He had died on Thursday last,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Mill had died on <date when="1836-06-23">23 June</date>, and was buried in Kensington Church.</note> before I wrote to you; I heard it before your Letter went off. I have not heard a syllable about Mill since or for a week before: I fancy he did not announce the event to anybody but a few of the deceased&#x2019;s friends. Last night I thought to hear something of it from Mrs Austin; but she&#x2014;was abroad over all the Earth (it was a <hi rend="italic">rout</hi>), and nothing but cackle, cackle was to be had there.&#x2014; James Mill has left a painful but not a dastardly or a dishonest life behind him: he finds strong censors, strong praisers. O dear, what a thrice beggarly business this earthly destiny of mans and of all men&#x2019;s is!</p>
<p>Sir W. Hamilton seems to be in keen contest with Combe the Phre<supplied>[n]</supplied>ologist for the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Logic Chair!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William Hamilton, Isaac Taylor (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), George Combe, and Patrick Campbell Macdougall were candidates. Hamilton had testimonials from Cousin, Jeffrey, Brewster, and Wilson amongst others. On <date when="1836-07-15">15 July</date> the Town Council elected Hamilton by 18 votes to Isaac Taylor&#x2019;s 14.</note> A printed sheaf of testimonials from him arrived here yesterday; for what special end is not clear. Scull-doctrine becoming Logic is surely a very grand phenomenon. They can fight it out between them: if I wished to fling inextinguishable ridicule on that old <foreign><hi rend="italic">Alma Mater</hi></foreign> (an <foreign><hi rend="italic">Arida Nutrix</hi></foreign> [Dry Nurse] she was the old b&#x2014;&#x2014;!) of mine in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, then <supplied>[Combe?]</supplied> should have the preferment without a moment&#x2019;s hesitation.&#x2014; This brings to mind, however, what was the only thing I had business with: that Fraser sent you a Book of Combe&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> (something about &#x201C;the mind,&#x201D; or such as that) a day or two after you went. It is laid up on your shelf, and awaits you.</p>
<p>When will you write? When will you come? The weather is very hot within these two days, and will probably be hotter: but there is a fine breeze still; the evenings, after sunset and thro&#x2019; night, are really grand and delightful. I came home last night near eleven, and saw. As already hinted, it was Mrs Austin&#x2019;s Party, Mrs Austin&#x2019;s rout. Having already refused several times, I had to go. There were Germans, Counts, Br&#xF6;ckhaus the Leipzig Bookseller, Mrs Buller, blonde and broadcloth what the house could hold: I staid an hour; then got my <pb id="pg-08-365" n="08:365"/>broadbrim, and took the liberty of retiring to natural rest. My amazement what diversion people get in these things remains considerable.&#x2014;</p>
<p>But alas, dear Jack, I tittle tattle; and really ought to be thinking of at least the attempt at some work. My love my best love to Annandale, beginning with my dear Mother, whom I hope you will still report well. I drank the last of Alick&#x2019;s whisky out yesterday: tell him so with thanks. There still remains a bottle entitled &#x201C;Inverness&#x201D;; which I will break when you come.&#x2014; I expect to hear from you at least with almost no delay.&#x2014; You have seen Grahame as well as Ben Nelson? My compliments and kindest wishes to the good Burnswark; also to Ben. <closer><salute>God bless you all! Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Jane has been out to walk; salutes you all: too pale-looking!</p>
<p>[JWC&#x2019;s postscript:]</p>
<p>Dear John I am not at all sure that I will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come to Scotland for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> or <hi rend="italic">three</hi> weeks&#x2014;but dont put any body on expecting me until I have made up my mind which will be within the next four and twenty hours I calculate.</p>

<p>Since I saw you, I have had an interview with the Mother of my feeble Cinderella&#x2014;a poor depressed creature, whom it is painful to see, and whom it would be next to impossible to use an<supplied>[y]</supplied>wise harshly&#x2014; She prays very earnestly that I should keep the useless Atom,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sereetha; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351012-JWC-TC-01"><sic>8:222</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-12">12 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> so long as I have accomodation [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for a thing of the sort; so what can I do but keep her and be patient?</p>
<p>To send her home to starve a few weeks before the appointed time; that I might be a little better waited upon in the mean time would turn to no good for any one.</p>
<p>Your benevolent purpose in my favour them [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], will remain a purpose; but I shall not therefore bear it less gratefully in remembrance&#x2014;for of course there would be no sense in having <hi rend="italic">two little girls</hi> who would indeed be a new version of the bewitched broomstick broken in despair into two bewitched broomsticks; each alike intent on deluging the house, and drowning the poor conjuror with too much service.</p>
<p>When will you come? On Friday week for certain, but before that I should like you to spend a day&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">calling</hi> is a nuisance for rational people. Your Husband would come to tea, and fetch you home&#x2014;I am sure he would; for he to<supplied>[o is?]</supplied> goodnatured</p>
<p>It is better that you should come to me at present than that I should go to you&#x2014; &#x2014; I am not comfortable in leaving my house for any length of time&#x2014;&#x26;c &#x26;c And the <hi rend="italic">ceremonial</hi> of the thing, I pay you the compliment to believe, goes for nothing with you as with me</p>
<p>I have forgot your number so perhaps this despatch will prove a failure</p>
<p>With kind regards to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Cole</p>
<closer><salute>Yours cordially /</salute></closer> <name>Jane Carlyle</name>
