<p>The editors are very grateful to the Arts and Humanities Research Board for its award of funding for three years from <date when="2003-07-00">July 2003</date> to support the Edinburgh editorial team and office. We are also particularly grateful to the National Endowment for the Humanities, which has generously awarded the project a three-year grant under the auspices of its new Scholarly Editions program. The grant provides funding for the maintenance of the Carlyle Letters office at the Duke University Press, the conversion of existing volumes to an electronic format, and the eventual preservation of the electronic edition in a trusted archive. A generous grant from the Research Libraries Program of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation will also assist us in meeting these aims. The editors again express their particular gratitude to the British Academy, which made the Carlyle Letters a British Academy Research Project and continues to support us with an annual grant, and to the members of its Committee on Academy Research Projects and its assistant secretary, Kenneth Emond.</p>
<p>We are extremely grateful for the ongoing advice of Paolo Mangiafico of Information Technology Services at Perkins Library, Duke University; and we extend our thanks for early critiques of the electronic edition to David Chesnutt of the Model Editions Partnership at the University of South Carolina and to Natalia Smith of the DocSouth project at the University of North Carolina. Brent E. Kinser serves as coordinator of the eCarlyle project in addition to his editorial service to the print edition. DNC Data Systems of New Bombay, India, has electronically encoded the existing volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Collected Letters</hi>, and Kirk V. Hastings and Martin Haye of California Digital Library have developed the XTF interface that will enable encoded volumes to be displayed on the Web.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since the publication of volume 33, eCarlyle has been renamed and published (<date when="2007-09-14">14 September 2007</date>) by Duke University Press as <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Letters Online</hi>, a project developed in conjunction with HighWire Press, Stanford University Libraries, and MethodFuel, Greensboro, North Carolina. </note></p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Kenneth J. Fielding</hi> died on <date when="2005-05-20">20 May 2005</date>, ending an almost forty years&#x2019; relationship with the <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Letters</hi> project, which he led with characteristic enthusiasm, drive, and restless energy, first with Charles Richard Sanders and then with Clyde de L. Ryals (see <ref target="volume-27/ed-27-in_memoriam">In Memoriam, vol. 27</ref>). When he joined the project in <date when="1966-00-00">1966</date>, he was already an internationally recognized Dickens scholar. He brought the same intelligence and passion to the <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Letters</hi>, and his status as a pre-eminent Victorian scholar was soon acknowledged throughout the field of English studies. His width of knowledge and reference was a priceless asset to the <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Letters</hi>, as was his record in tracing new papers, archives, and relationships. He co-edited Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> for Oxford University Press and a selection of Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x2019;s letters for Ashgate, while finding time in a very busy professional life to produce a dizzying array of articles on a wide range of subjects. At conferences his papers were measured and delivered with the authority of someone who had given decades to his subject. He retired officially as Senior Editor after the publication of volume 29 but continued as Advisory Editor for subsequent volumes. His life&#x2019;s work has contributed vitally to assure the completion of the project. His presence will be much missed by those of us still working on the <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Letters</hi>, as it will be by scholars and general readers interested in nineteenth-century literature, history, and culture.</p><pb id="lastpage-33-xiii" n="33:xiii"/>

<p>This volume includes letters from <date when="1857-08-00">August 1857</date> to the end of <date when="1858-06-00">June 1858</date>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the 189 letters in this volume, 139 are from TC and 50 from JWC. The imbalance is mainly because fewer of JWC&#x2019;s letters have survived. We know there were letters to Geraldine Jewsbury and that she wrote weekly letters to the Donaldsons, but none of these letters is available. Ten (20 percent) of JWC&#x2019;s letters in this volume and 98 (71 percent) of TC&#x2019;s are previously unpublished. Eleven of JWC&#x2019;s letters (22 percent) and six of TC&#x2019;s (4 percent) are previously published in part. A much greater proportion of JWC&#x2019;s letters (23, i.e., 46 percent) than of TC&#x2019;s (19, i.e., 14 percent) are published in collections. This is partly because TC prepared them for publication after JWC&#x2019;s death; many of them are published either in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, or Alexander Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi>. Of the remainder of TC&#x2019;s letters, 16 are quoted (i.e., less than half and sometimes only a sentence or two) (11 percent). Of the remainder of JWC&#x2019;s letters, six are quoted (12 percent).</note> It begins with Jane Welsh Carlyle in Scotland, where she has been since <date when="1857-07-07">7 July 1857</date>. Her bouts of ill health had been increasingly prolonged and debilitating over the previous two years. The holiday in Scotland was intended to restore her health and to enable her to withstand the coming London winter. Her first letters are from Auchtertool, Fife, where she is visiting her cousins, while Thomas Carlyle is in Chelsea working on the proofs of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and the cheap edition of his works. TC&#x2019;s interest in writing on Frederick the Great was evident as early as <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date> (<ref target="volume-05/lt-18300521-TC-GRG-01">TC to GRG, <date when="1830-05-21">21 May 1830</date></ref>). By <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date> he was reading intensively about Frederick (<ref target="volume-19/lt-18450819-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1845-08-19">19 Aug. 1845</date></ref>); by <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date> he was thinking seriously about writing his history (<ref target="volume-27/lt-18520625-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1852-06-25">25 June 1852</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520706-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1852-07-06">6 July 1852</date></ref>); by <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>, the period covered by the current volume, TC doubts that he will get through the work alive. His complaints are loud, boisterous, and frequent, scarcely using the same phrase twice to describe his pain. He informs Lord Ashburton, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571115-TC-LOA-01"><date when="1857-11-15">15 November 1857</date></ref>: &#x201C;No such job, I often think, was ever laid upon a reasonable creature. &#x2026; In truth, it has quite broken my heart.&#x201C; He writes to his brother John, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571207-TC-JAC-01"><date when="1857-12-07">7 December 1857</date></ref>, that it is a &#x201C;mass of paper clippings&#x201C; and &#x201C;paltry marine-stores&#x201C;; to G. H. Lewes, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571207-TC-GHL-01"><date when="1857-12-07">7 December</date></ref>, that he will be driven mad by it; to Leigh Hunt, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580103-TC-JHLH-01"><date when="1858-01-03">3 January 1858</date></ref>, that he is &#x201C;crushed down with contemptible overwhelming labour this long time&#x201C;; and to Emerson, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580602-TC-RWE-01"><date when="1858-06-02">2 June 1858</date></ref>, &#x201C;[N]obody ought to write,&#x2014;unless sheer Fate force him to do it;&#x2014;and then he ought (if <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of the mountebank genus) to beg to be shot rather.&#x201C; In fact, <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (a burden that had afflicted the lives of both TC and JWC) was not to be finished until just over a year before JWC&#x2019;s death in <date when="1866-04-00">April 1866</date>. Geraldine Jewsbury wrote at its completion, <date when="1865-03-24">24 March 1865</date>: &#x201C;Carlyle has finished Frederick! &#x26; his wife who ought to know <pb id="pg-33-xvi" n="33:xvi"/>declaring that he has been kicking up his heels in a wonderful way ever since!&#x201C; (Mantell Papers, Alexander Turnbull Library).</p>
<p>JWC&#x2019;s letters are written for the most part to entertain and beguile; they are long, witty, and perceptive, even when she is writing to TC of her depression and illness. Auchtertool is too chaotic for her, but vitality, not misery, is the main characteristic of her letter to TC in which she describes her discomfort:</p>
<p>Oh Heavens! or rather, oh the other Place! &#x201C;I am degenerating from a woman into a dog, and feel an inclination to bark; <hi rend="italic">bow! wow! wow!</hi>&#x201C; Ever since I came here I have been passing out of one silent rage into another, at <hi rend="italic">the Things in general</hi> of this House! viewed from the Invalid-point of view, they are enough really to make one not only bark but bite. (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18570803-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-08-03">3 Aug. 1857</date>]</ref>)</p>
<p>Later, when Jeannie Chrystal, the beloved Babbie of JWC&#x2019;s earlier letters, arrives, JWC is enraged by her entourage:</p>
<p>Jeanie and her suite did not arrive till yesterday&#x2014;The Baby is about three finger lengths long&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> nurses nearly six feet each! <hi rend="italic">five</hi> packing cases came before them &#x2026; ! and as many portmanteaus and carpet-bags in the carriage <hi rend="italic">with</hi> them!&#x2014;&#x201C;Did you ever?&#x201C; &#x201C;No&#x2014;I never!&#x201C; &#x2026; [I]t is only the speedy prospect of getting far away from it that has enabled me to keep from bursting out into swearing (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18570813-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-08-13">13 Aug. 1857</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>Her letters to friends are enriched by stories; for example, the theatrical and farcical story she relates to Agnes Howden of the bug in her servant Anne&#x2019;s ear; it ends with the image of Anne rushing off to the apothecary with blood pouring from her ear, JWC rushing out after Anne, and TC rushing out to pull JWC back (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18571123-JWC-AHO-01">JWC to <sic>AH</sic><corr>AHO</corr>, [<date when="1857-11-23">23 Nov. 1857</date>]</ref>). In a letter to David Davidson, she uses her apology for the lateness of her reply as a vehicle for telling him the story of Georgiana Craik&#x2019;s smallpox and the way in which it &#x201C;made a very pretty girl into a plain one&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18571105-JWC-DD-01">JWC to DD, <date when="1857-11-05">5 Nov. 1857</date></ref>). Other stories are embedded in the text of her letters and are told in a few words; the horrifying story of the Gilchrists&#x2019; servant who strangled her baby and locked it away in her trunk is told in a sentence to <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580200-JWC-IC-01">Isabella Carlyle, <date when="1858-02-00">February 1858</date></ref>. In another letter to Agnes Howden, she delights in the macabre, asking her if her father, Dr. Howden, prescribes pepsin, the latest fad in medicine, apparently procured from the scrapings of the stomachs of dead people: &#x201C;Pleasant isn&#x2019;t it, the idea of swallowing the scrapings of&#x2014;say a malefactors stomach&#x2014;in drops! What next?&#x201C; [<ref target="volume-33/lt-18571024-JWC-AHO-01"><date when="1857-10-24">24 Oct. 1857</date></ref>]. She makes the story more macabre by her references to the scrapings of the stomachs of two famous poisoners, William Palmer and Madeleine Smith, whose trials had fascinated her (see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:252</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-05-16">16</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-05-17">17 May 1856</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570705-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1857-07-05">5 July 1857</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p><pb id="pg-33-xvii" n="33:xvii"/>JWC&#x2019;s comments on Lord Ashburton give us a new perspective, a close-up of the man, easier to see now that he is no longer overshadowed by his first wife, Lady Harriet Ashburton, who had died in <date when="1857-05-00">May 1857</date> (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570507-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1857-05-07">7 May 1857</date></ref>). She comments to TC that in general he is &#x201C;so sweet-natured; and yet the only sentiment I ever see him express in a <hi rend="italic">real human</hi> way is <hi rend="italic">anger!</hi> &#x2026; but all the rest of his sentiments (his grief included) seem no more <hi rend="italic">really</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">his</hi> than the sentiments of Macbeth are William Macready&#x2019;s indeed not so much! He plays the part of <hi rend="italic">his own Life</hi> like a <hi rend="italic">third rate</hi> actor&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18570830-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-08-30">30 Aug. 1857</date>]</ref>). She tells Mary Russell: &#x201C;It is not so much <hi rend="italic">sorrow</hi> that troubles him one would say, as <hi rend="italic">bewilderment</hi>&#x2014;He looks like a child who has lost his nurse in a wood&#x2014;I expect some scheming woman will marry him up &#x2026; because he does [not] know what to do with himself, and would be glad that some one took the trouble of him off his hands&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18571002-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1857-10-02">2 Oct. 1857</date>]</ref>). In <date when="1858-11-00">November 1858</date> (vol. 34), Ashburton was to marry Louisa Mackenzie, who was described by <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570915-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord Ashburton</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1857-09-15">15 September 1857</date></ref>, as &#x201C;a bright vivacious damsel, straggling fitfully about, like a sweet-briar,&#x2014;and with hooks under her flowers, too, I understand.&#x201C; This is almost certainly TC indulging his capacity for sharing gossip rather than meant as a warning to his old friend. Lady Louisa Ashburton was to become a close friend of both Carlyles.</p>
<p>Many of TC&#x2019;s letters are about the process of publishing; they are short, giving instructions to printers and helpers, and negotiating terms, where he often drives a hard bargain. Occasionally his letters contain what Ruskin called his &#x201C;lovingly involuntary eloquence of description&#x201C; that Ruskin sees in <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and that makes it impossible for him to understand TC&#x2019;s anguish over its writing (<hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> [Orpington, <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>] 2:240; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580416-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1858-04-16">[16] April 1858</date></ref>). A description of an evening ride from Richmond to Chelsea provides an example of these powers of description, present in all his published works but less often in his letters: &#x201C;The ride home was rapid, somewhat chaotic; darkness having fallen in the interim. London and all places were clangouring and jangling with their Sunday bells; a heaped-up universe of frosty fog, with flares of gaslight visible in it, hung on my right: a ride as thro&#x2019; a nightmare, tho&#x2019; an ugly fact withal&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18580104-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1858-01-04">4 Jan. 1858</date></ref>).</p>
<p>Central to this volume, as to others, is the ebb and flow of the Carlyles&#x2019; mutually dependant but difficult relationship. Letters to each other in the first part of the volume continue the mood of those in volume 32 (<date when="1856-10-00">October 1856</date> to <date when="1857-07-00">July 1857</date>). JWC is weak and ill, and TC is paternal and caring. However, after the disappointment of receiving from TC only a copy of <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> and some photographs, she can still write: &#x201C;I could have thrown it at your head&#x2014;Neither was I inordinately grateful for the Photographs&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18570803-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1857-08-03">3 Aug. 1857</date></ref>). TC writes to her, <date when="1857-08-05">5 August 1857</date>: &#x201C;I am glad at any rate that you make your bits of complaints freely to me. &#x2026; I know you for an honest soul (far too sharp-tempered, but <hi rend="italic">true</hi> to the bone); &#x2026; tell me everything; <pb id="pg-33-xviii" n="33:xviii"/>and never mind how &#x2018;weak&#x2019; you are before me: I know y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> strength and y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> weakness very well by this time!&#x201C; JWC is not always at ease with the balance of their relationship (as could be seen at the start of her summer in Scotland; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570726-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1857-07-26">26 July 1857</date></ref>), but in her weak state she cannot redress it, and alongside the energy of some of her writing there is deep fear and despair. She writes, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570810-JWC-TC-01"><date when="1857-08-10">10 August 1857</date></ref>, that her physical pain although gone was &#x201C;followed by such horrible depression of spirits that it felt as if one degree more of it would make me hang or drown myself.&#x201C; Yet two weeks later, she writes a joyful and enthusiastic letter about the first two volumes of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> of which she has just read the proofs. She swears it will be &#x201C;the best of all your Books! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> say so who <hi rend="italic">never flatter,</hi> as you are too well aware; and who am &#x2018;the only person I know that is always in the right!&#x2019;&#x201C; But, she concludes, &#x201C;small thanks to <hi rend="italic">it!</hi> It has taken a <hi rend="italic">doing!</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18570824-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-08-24">24 Aug. 1857</date>]</ref>). TC writes in answer, full of gratitude, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570825-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1857-08-25">25 August 1857</date></ref>, that she had always &#x201C;predicted good&#x201C; of him whether or not he was valued by the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The mutual support, affection, and respect they frequently afforded each other is at its height here, but it does not last. <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> continues to take its toll on their lives and their marriage. JWC no longer has Lady Ashburton and her own jealousy as a catalyst; the tensions between her and TC are different from those in previous volumes. As soon as JWC is back in Chelsea, she complains to Mary Russell, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571002-JWC-MR-01"><date when="1857-10-02">2 October 1857</date></ref>, that TC is responsible for giving her another cold; to Mary Austin, TC&#x2019;s sister, she writes that when she asked TC if he had written to thank Mary for a food parcel she had sent, &#x201C;he exclaimed <hi rend="italic">wildly</hi> that he had &#x2018;fifteen hours of the most <hi rend="italic">awful</hi> work, of correcting proofs a-head of him&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">I who had nothing to do</hi> should have written to Mary&#x2019;&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18571225-JWC-MCA-01"><date when="1857-12-25">25 Dec. 1857</date></ref>). In the same letter she writes that they no longer eat together; JWC dines &#x201C;on <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> at two o&#x2019;clock; not being up to waiting for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s six or seven o clock dinners.&#x201C; She later describes the disruption at Cheyne Row of her two young cousins&#x2019; visit: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C alone escaped &#x2018;consequences&#x2019;; &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">his</hi> work, <hi rend="italic">his</hi> meals all that was <hi rend="italic">his</hi> was strictly guarded from disturbance! But the <hi rend="italic">strain</hi> of constituting oneself a human partition-wall&#x2014;betwixt <hi rend="italic">work</hi> and trifling, takes more out of one than anyone could believe till he tried!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18571231-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1857-12-31">31 Dec. 1857</date>]</ref>). By the end of the volume (<date when="1858-06-00">June 1858</date>), JWC&#x2019;s depression and her anger at TC has reached another climax. Again they are separated, this time with TC in Scotland and JWC in Chelsea. To Mary Russell, she complains that living with TC has been like &#x201C;living the life of a weathercock in a high wind, blowing from all points at once&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18580627-JWC-MR-01">[<date when="1858-06-27">27 June 1858</date>]</ref>). A letter to TC in late June is, on the surface, a beautifully light letter, full of coterie speech and references to fairy stories. She tells him about Charlotte Southam, the new servant, and Mrs. Newnham&#x2019;s &#x201C;little sick daughter, lying out on the green today, reading Fairy Tales. &#x2026; Our <hi rend="italic">green</hi> to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> is grander than the Grange grounds to <hi rend="italic">us!</hi>&#x201C; Yet <pb id="pg-33-xix" n="33:xix"/>buried in the middle of it she writes: &#x201C;[T]o see <hi rend="italic">you</hi> constantly discontented and as much so with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as with all other <hi rend="italic">things</hi> &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> has done me more harm than you have the least notion of&#x2014;You have not the least notion what a killing thought it is, to have put into one&#x2019;s heart, gnawing there day and night, that one <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18580625-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-06-25">25 June 1858</date>]</ref>). TC responds, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580628-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1858-06-28">28 June 1858</date></ref>, with &#x201C;[Y]our anger at me (grounded on that false basis) was itself sometimes a kind of comfort to me: I tho<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> &#x2018;Well, she has the strength to be cross and illnatured at me; she is not all softness and affection and <hi rend="italic">weakness!</hi>&#x2019;&#x201C; This could have been a genuine attempt to understand JWC or merely his way of shelving JWC&#x2019;s distress while he buried himself in <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi> Certainly in his letters to other people, he is concerned about her. He writes to his brother John: &#x201C;She is very feckless; tho&#x2019; full of spirit, when she can get the least chance; <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> is still a scarcity; and <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> temperature seems to tell on her at once&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18571228-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1857-12-28">28 Dec. 1857</date></ref>).</p>
<p>The most detailed record of the Carlyles&#x2019; relationship by an outsider during this period is by Henry Larkin, and it has been used extensively in the notes to this volume. Larkin was helping TC with his cheap edition and with <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> and he was a frequent visitor to Cheyne Row; he developed close relationships with both Carlyles. He remembers realizing &#x201C;the intense dreariness of [JWC&#x2019;s] own life&#x201C; and the misery of being shut up with TC &#x201C;when he himself was struggling under his burdens in utter wretchedness and gloominess of heart. &#x2026; [W]hat she felt most keenly of all was, that he never seemed to realize that misery is the most contagious of all diseases. &#x2026; And yet, I ought to say, I never once heard an angry word pass between themselves&#x201C; (Larkin, <hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 49&#x2013;51). However, Larkin&#x2019;s account is not contemporary but written shortly after the publication in <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date> of <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> which so shocked and surprised those who had known the Carlyles. Larkin presents another view, looking in hindsight at a very complex marriage.</p>
<p>The letters in this volume help us to see beyond the Carlyles&#x2019; iconic status as a couple; they give us fresh knowledge of other aspects of the Carlyles&#x2019; lives. JWC&#x2019;s increasing fondness for Scotland and nostalgic memories of her youth are present in most of her letters. While in Scotland, she wants to spend her time with people who were fond of her as a child, her aunts and the Donaldson sisters, who will pamper her and restore order to her ravaged brain after the turmoil of Auchtertool, travel, and illness. She does not visit Mary Russell because Thornhill is &#x201C;too emotional by far for worn-out spirits&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18570822-JWC-JCA-01">JWC to JCA, <date when="1857-08-22">22 Aug. 1857</date></ref>). One-third of her letters are to old friends in Scotland; as in volume 32, the majority are to Mary Russell. Increasingly, it is in the past that she finds comfort from the trials of the present. To William Dods, a school friend who had &#x201C;smoothed her journey to London, as by magic,&#x201C; she recalls a childhood event when the morning was &#x201C;all glancing like diamonds, and smelling of hawthorn and sweet briar, with the dew on <pb id="pg-33-xx" n="33:xx"/>them! &#x2026; It was in <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date> that Arcadian transaction. &#x2026; I cannot get the date forgotten; for it stands written &#x2026; in your hand-writing, on the rim of my mathematical-instrument-case&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18570919-JWC-WDO-01">JWC to <sic>WD</sic><corr>WDO</corr>, [<date when="1857-09-19">19? Sept. 1857</date>]</ref>). She writes to David Davidson, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571105-JWC-DD-01"><date when="1857-11-05">5 November 1857</date></ref>, that the letter he sends from Haddington &#x201C;was like hearing music from one&#x2019;s far home in a strange Land! I paid it the compliment of crying over it.&#x201C; She describes her &#x201C;picture gallery&#x201C; with the sketch of Sunny Bank, her godmother&#x2019;s home, opposite her bed which she needs, as Ruskin needs his Turners, to have &#x201C;something spirit-stirring&#x201C; to wake up to. When he sends her a photograph of himself, she tries hard to recall through it the &#x201C;image of the tall pale Boy that my mother was so fond of&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18571229-JWC-DD-01">JWC to DD, <date when="1857-12-29">29 Dec. 1857</date></ref>). To Agnes Howden she writes: &#x201C;I like to hear of your Halloween&#x2014;my ideas of Halloween are all connected with Maitlandfield. I always spent it <hi rend="italic">there</hi> as far back as I recollect. Have ducked for apples and burnt nuts in that very kitchen of yours&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18571123-JWC-AHO-01"><date when="1857-11-23">23 Nov. 1857</date></ref>). The links with Scotland, which had become tenuous during her long absence prior to her <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> visit (see <sic>24:159&#x2013;71</sic><corr><ref target="volume-24/lt-18490802-JWC-MAAN-01">JWC&#x2019;s MAAN, <date when="1849-08-02">2 Aug. 1849</date></ref></corr>), were strengthened. The increased convenience of the trains between London and Scotland made it practically easier for JWC to return to her roots, but the renewed ties are also to do with an emotional return, a recollection of valued friendships and attachments; in the end, as TC later chose Ecclefechan, she chose to be buried in her birthplace of Haddington.</p>
<p>Two major crises in JWC&#x2019;s personal life would have increased her reliance on her friends in Scotland. First of all, her old friend and confidante Geraldine Jewsbury has &#x201C;all but as good as gone out of my life!!!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18580116-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1858-01-16">16 Jan. 1858</date>]</ref>). Jewsbury had fallen in love with Walter Mantell, who had been living in New Zealand and who had come to London to plead for Maori rights. Jewsbury supported his cause and became increasingly devoted to him. In the same letter JWC is excessively critical of Jewsbury: &#x201C;[A]ll that makes me so angry, and what is worse disgusts me! It is making herself so small.&#x201C; It is more likely that JWC is angered by the diversion of Jewsbury&#x2019;s attention away from herself at a time when she is feeling vulnerable.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a detailed discussion of the relationship between Jewsbury and Mantell, see Norma Clarke, <hi rend="italic">Ambitious Heights</hi> (1990) 210&#x2013;23.</note> She was looking forward to seeing Jewsbury on her return from Scotland: &#x201C;I shall have no end of little histories to tell you when you are there, and at leisure to hear them&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18570911-JWC-GEJ-01">JWC to GEJ, [<date when="1857-09-11">11? Sept. 1857</date>]</ref>). But Jewsbury was away too long, and JWC felt abandoned. When Jewsbury does appear, however, JWC is still happy to use her to run errands. She announces to TC that there is no need for him to rush back from The Grange for her: &#x201C;With Geraldine at hand I dont suffer the same <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> inconvenience from being confined to the house&#x2014;I can send <hi rend="italic">her</hi> on <hi rend="italic">any</hi> message and ask her to do <hi rend="italic">anything</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18580118-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-01-18">18 Jan. 1858</date>]</ref>). <pb id="pg-33-xxi" n="33:xxi"/>The second misfortune was her worsening relationship with Anne, her servant of almost five years, who left at the end of <date when="1858-03-00">March 1858</date>. Her resentments against both Geraldine and Anne are poured out to Mary Russell (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580116-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1858-01-16">16 Jan. 1858</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>In spite of his desperation over <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> TC is not the recluse he claims to be. He tells Joseph Neuberg, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570822-TC-JN-01"><date when="1857-08-22">22 August 1857</date></ref>, that he sees no one, yet on <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570817-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1857-08-17">17 August</date></ref> he writes to JWC that he has seen Woolner, Lady Downshire, and Jewsbury; on <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570819-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1857-08-19">19 August</date></ref> that he has been visited by Thomas Wilson; and on <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570825-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1857-08-25">25 August</date></ref> that he has visited Anthony Sterling, dined with Darwin, and met the Wedgwoods and John Allen. &#xc9;mile Mont&#xE9;gut dedicates an essay to him (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580416-TC-EM-01">TC to EM, <date when="1858-04-16">16 April 1858</date></ref>); Leopold von Orlich, the Prussian military historian, offers to help him with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580309-TC-LST-01">TC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LST</corr>, <date when="1858-03-09">9 March 1858</date></ref>) and he has regular contact with Henry Larkin, Vernon Lushington, and Neuberg, his ever willing helpers. There is also a light-hearted, fond exchange of letters between him and Ellen Twisleton, <date when="1857-12-10">10</date> and <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571212-TC-ETW-01"><date when="1857-12-12">12 December 1857</date></ref>. By the end of <date when="1858-04-00">April 1858</date>, although gloomily aware of the work still to be done on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and pessimistic about its outcome, he is relieved that at least the first part is now almost finished. He attends a dinner at Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s, <date when="1857-04-20">20 April</date>, where, John Tyndall reports to a friend, he and TC were &#x201C;the most joyful pair at the table&#x201C; and that TC was &#x201C;in choice condition, strong and fervent.&#x201C; Throughout this period, Robert Tait is almost constantly present, taking photographs or working on his painting <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior.</hi> The Carlyles complain about him, <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior,</hi> and the smell of his photography, although photography is a new technology that delights and fascinates them, not only because they can send pictures of themselves and their house to friends and relatives but also because it represents another record of their lives and their world (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580400-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [<date when="1858-04-00">April</date>/<date when="1858-05-00">May 1858</date>]</ref>). Nor did <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> drive away all of TC&#x2019;s other interests. He takes time to write to Richard Owen, the natural historian, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580517-TC-RO-01"><date when="1858-05-17">17 May 1858</date></ref>, about the prehistoric bones he has seen near Victoria station when men were digging up the road. Owen has another indirect link to the countless stories embedded in the Carlyles&#x2019; letters. Walter Mantell, JWC&#x2019;s rival for Jewsbury&#x2019;s affection, supplied the bird bones for part of Owen&#x2019;s research in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>. Mantell had sent them from New Zealand to his father, Gideon Mantell, also a natural historian, who allowed Owen access to them and who later became deeply critical of Owen.</p>
<p>Two international events affect the Carlyles in this volume: the uprising in India and the financial crisis. In the previous volume, before the seriousness and horror of the Indian rebellion became apparent, TC largely ignored it. In this volume he engages far more with it. Shocked and angered by it, he blames not the rebels but the British for political and military mismanagement. He tells Lord Ashburton, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570831-TC-LOA-01"><date when="1857-08-31">31 August 1857</date></ref>: &#x201C;The Indian Affairs hang like a millstone on me. &#x2026; It seems to me neither greased Cartridges, nor <pb id="pg-33-xxii" n="33:xxii"/>Col<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Wheeler, nor our procedures in Oude, nor any other mysterious Secondary cause is worth talking of in the presence of a most clear and patent <hi rend="italic">primary cause,</hi> an Army with Officers of the Imaginary sort!&#x201C; To his brother John, he writes, <date when="1857-09-11">11 September 1857</date>: &#x201C;Sensible men (a smallish company here) are shocked and alarmed at these Indian phenomena. Very disgraceful to England (to English Officership in particular), and the English style of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Army.</hi>&#x2019;&#x201C; There is no satisfaction for him when the rebellion is put down and he is appalled at the brutality with which it is done. He writes to John Strachey, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570913-TC-JSTR-01"><date when="1857-09-13">13 September 1857</date></ref>: &#x201C;I cannot bear to read those inhuman details in the Newspapers. &#x2026; To punish the Sepoys, and mince them all to pieces &#x26;c &#x26;c.&#x201C; JWC too is shocked. She writes to TC of the massacre of women and children and its confirmation of her own religious scepticism: &#x201C;It is difficult to reconcile such things with the belief that God takes care of every individual he has made! &#x2018;God is Love&#x2019;&#x2014;Love? It isn&#x2019;t much like a world ruled by <hi rend="italic">Love</hi> this&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18570810-JWC-TC-01"><date when="1857-08-10">10 Aug. 1857</date></ref>). The only comfort she has is from the women&#x2019;s letters from India: &#x201C;The men&#x2019;s letters are detestable generally. &#x2026; But some of the <hi rend="italic">women,</hi> afterwards murdered, write, in presence of their horrible fate, with a calm fortitude, and pious resignation that are <hi rend="italic">sublime</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18571008-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1857-10-08">8 Oct. 1857</date></ref>).</p>
<p>As early as <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570813-TC-AC-01"><date when="1857-08-13">13 August 1857</date></ref>, TC writes to his brother Alexander in Canada of the overblown economy in Scotland and the rest of Britain: &#x201C;[A]ll things rising in price; all manner of gamblers getting &#x2018;fortunes&#x2019; &#x26;c &#x26;c: and by and by there will be a very <hi rend="italic">burbly</hi> account to settle indeed.&#x201C; By the autumn, TC&#x2019;s prediction was coming true, and the financial crisis, which began in the United States in the late summer of <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>, very soon began to affect British financial institutions. Several of the Carlyles&#x2019; friends were affected by the crisis. Some of Ellen Twisleton&#x2019;s family lost &#x201C;nine-tenths of all they had,&#x201C; and the elderly Jessie Donaldson wrote, <date when="1857-12-30">30 December 1857</date>: &#x201C;The Bank failures are my all absorbing subject&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571115-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1857-11-15">15 Nov. 1857</date></ref>). TC&#x2019;s attitude to his own losses is interesting. JWC describes it: &#x201C;Mr C. has or <hi rend="italic">had</hi> some money in America&#x2014;He <hi rend="italic">doesn&#x2019;t recollect how much!</hi> and doesn&#x2019;t feel even a natural <hi rend="italic">curiosity</hi> what is become of it!!&#x201C; According to JWC, he takes the loss lightly and generously expresses pity for Charles Butler, who had looked after his investments for him (<ref target="volume-33/lt-18571123-JWC-AHO-01">JWC to <sic>AH</sic><corr>AHO</corr>, [<date when="1857-11-23">23 Nov. 1857</date>]</ref>). This is confirmed by TC&#x2019;s letter to Butler of <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580609-TC-CBU-01"><date when="1858-06-09">9 June 1858</date></ref><sic>(found too late to be included chronologically in this volume; see vol. 34)</sic>. This is a different TC from the one we see bargaining with publishers, but the same TC who, in a letter to JWC, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580630-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1858-06-30">30 June 1858</date></ref>, offers help to pay for her cousin John Welsh (dying of tuberculosis) to go to Madeira.</p>
<p>The Carlyles&#x2019; letters are as multilayered and complex as their characters. TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and JWC&#x2019;s illness and depression certainly circumscribed their lives and affected their relationship, but there were other dimensions. <pb id="lastpage-33-xxiii" n="33:xxiii"/>TC&#x2019;s retrospective remarks about this period are misleading when he says that JWC&#x2019;s enthusiasm over <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> is &#x201C;the last &#x2026; bit of pure sunshine that visited my dark and lonesome &#x2026; enterprise of Frederick&#x201C; (pbd. in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:332; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570824-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-08-24">24 Aug. 1857</date>]</ref>). Both the Carlyles&#x2019; reactions and responses to each other, to other people, and to events were immediate and intense. Constructing a narrative from their letters is not straightforward; their tone and energy is often inconsistent with the misery they say they are enduring and with their own overt narrative. The Carlyles&#x2019; brilliance is undiminished by their suffering, and the brightness of the letters never fails to cast a new light on their marriage and the world they inhabit.</p>

<p><bold><date when="1857-00-00">1857</date></bold> <hi rend="italic"><date when="1857-08-00">August.</date></hi> TC, working in Chelsea in the summer heat, often under an awning in the garden, writes to JWC staying with her cousins in Auchtertool, Fife. Tait has been photographing Cheyne Row and is working on <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior.</hi> TC rides to Addiscombe (<date when="1857-08-03">3</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-08-04">4</date>), but notes, &#x201C;I pretty much have the Town to myself.&#x201C; JWC is restless, irritated by household annoyances at Auchtertool: &#x201C;I sleep shockingly, and the sickness has come back&#x201C; (<date when="1857-08-03">3</date>); she declines invitations to Scotsbrig, Thornhill, and Cortachy Castle. Larkin has been &#x201C;amazingly <hi rend="italic">useful</hi>&#x201C; (<date when="1857-08-11">11</date>) to TC in his writing, and is helping with maps. Printing of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> has begun; further volumes of the cheap edition are published. TC notes widespread prosperity and an excellent harvest after good summer weather (<date when="1857-08-11">11</date>), but warns of looming financial crisis (<date when="1857-08-13">13</date>). JWC leaves Auchtertool to stay with her aunts in Edinburgh (<date when="1857-08-13">13</date>). TC asks Larkin and Charles Robson to send an early copy of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> to his brother John in Scotland. TC complains that there are few visitors, despite visits from Woolner, Lady Downshire, Darwin, and Geraldine Jewsbury (<date when="1857-08-17">17</date>, <date when="1857-08-25">25</date>); Jewsbury writes to JWC with Chelsea news (<date when="1857-08-18">18</date>) that annoys JWC. She enjoys being with her aunts and visiting friends in Edinburgh (<date when="1857-08-26">26</date>) before going on to an affectionate welcome from the Donaldsons in Haddington. TC finds progress on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> slow and difficult. He rides regularly, usually alone, once with Lord Goderich (<date when="1857-08-27">27</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1857-09-00">September.</date></hi> TC works in Cheyne Row, trying to control his irritability, while JWC goes to stay with the Donaldsons in Haddington. Weather oppressively hot in London, and TC longs to have JWC home, &#x201C;if you were in harness beside me again&#x201C; (<date when="1857-09-03">3</date>). He dines twice with Lady Sandwich and rides for exercise, while during the day he works hard on proofs. JWC hesitates about her railway route back to London, finally choosing the east coast line (<date when="1857-09-09">9</date>); she returns to London in improved health. Count von Usedom sends TC materials for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1857-09-10">10</date>); TC expects more trouble to come in India (<date when="1857-09-15">15</date>); and with Larkin&#x2019;s help, TC begins preparing maps for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1857-09-16">16</date>). David Hope&#x2019;s death brings a sense of loneliness and of old friends dying (<date when="1857-09-17">17</date>). JWC&#x2019;s good health continues, but she soon gets another cold (<date when="1857-09-17">17</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1857-10-00">October.</date></hi> Larkin book-hunts for TC and, with Lushington, prepares indexes and revisions for the reprints of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Heroes.</hi> Varnhagen von Ense provides material on Voltaire for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1857-10-07">7</date>). JWC complains she has lost <pb id="pg-33-xxxiv" n="33:xxxiv"/>her &#x201C;fine gift of <hi rend="italic">walking</hi>&#x201C; and misses the exercise; her cold finally abates (<date when="1857-10-08">8</date>). TC tells Chapman, his publisher, that two volumes of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> will be ready for the printer in <date when="1858-03-00">March</date> (in the event, <date when="1858-06-00">June</date>) <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date> and asks him to think about American publication arrangements (<date when="1857-10-25">25</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1857-11-00">November.</date></hi> TC acknowledges Robert Story&#x2019;s finely printed <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1857-11-01">1</date>)<hi rend="italic">.</hi> He asks Neuberg to do the summaries and indexes for the <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> volumes of the new cheap edition (<date when="1857-11-02">2</date>), while he concentrates on <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi> JWC writes affectionately <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571105-JWC-DD-01">to David Davidson</ref> with reminiscences of Haddington (<date when="1857-11-05">5</date>). Neuberg is translating <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> for a German edition (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>) (<date when="1857-11-13">13</date>); TC revises earlier work for republication in the cheap edition of his <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> and works on <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> though he feels in his darker moments &#x201C;as if I never sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get thro&#x2019; it alive&#x201C; (<date when="1857-11-15">15</date>). There is a London stock market crisis following a financial panic in the United States. JWC complains of Tait&#x2019;s excessive attention to detail, painting their home &#x201C;with Vandyke fidelity&#x201C; for <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior</hi> (<date when="1857-11-20">20</date>). Maggie and Mary Welsh are to visit at Chelsea en route to the Isle of Wight, and JWC has carpenters and seamstresses in the house to repair earlier flood damage to the spare bed in preparation for their visit; the servant Anne gets a beetle in her ear, which the apothecary &#x201C;extracted piecemeal&#x201C; (<date when="1857-11-23">23</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1857-12-00">December.</date></hi> J. H. Stirling visits (<date when="1857-12-01">1</date>). Tait continues to paint downstairs, getting on both the Carlyles&#x2019; nerves. The steamship <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi> is proving difficult to launch into the Thames (<date when="1857-12-07">7</date>). TC, overwhelmed with work, refuses most invitations, and leaves the detail of the cheap edition increasingly to Larkin. Maggie and Mary Welsh visit (<date when="1857-12-14">14</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-12-24">24</date>). &#x201C;My book goes lumbering on&#x201C; (<date when="1857-12-20">20</date>), the printers as usual finding TC&#x2019;s manuscripts difficult. Provisions arrive from Scotsbrig, including oatmeal (<date when="1857-12-23">23</date>). Printing of first two volumes of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> advances and &#x201C;Xmas and the two days following&#x201C; are spent &#x201C;with the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> refractory set of Proofsheets I expect in this work&#x201C; (<date when="1857-12-28">28</date>). Ruskin sends his lectures on <hi rend="italic">The Political Economy of Art,</hi> &#x201C;not bad of their kind&#x201C; (<date when="1857-12-28">28</date>). Both send New Year wishes to friends and family. JWC is glad that her cousins&#x2019; visit is over, and that she has so far escaped her normal winter cold (<date when="1857-12-29">29</date>).</p>
<p><bold><date when="1858-01-00">January</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-06-00">June 1858</date></bold></p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1858-01-00">January.</date></hi> TC retrieves proofs of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> volumes 1 and 2 from Forster (<date when="1858-01-01">1</date>). Larkin is helping with the maps, but TC reports himself &#x201C;crushed down with contemptible overwhelming labour this long time&#x201C; (<date when="1858-01-03">3</date>). He is glad to hear from Leigh Hunt after a long silence (<date when="1858-01-03">3</date>). A. J. Scott visits (<date when="1858-01-04">4</date>). For relaxation, TC joins Lord Ashburton at The Grange to ride on the Hampshire Downs (<date when="1858-01-16">16</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-01-20">20</date>); TC leaves his horse, Fritz, there to rest during the cold weather. Despite intending to join TC at The Grange JWC remains at Cheyne Row <pb id="pg-33-xxxv" n="33:xxxv"/>suffering from a cold. Jewsbury is in Manchester, and the Carlyles&#x2019; servant, Anne, is being difficult. Jewsbury returns while TC is at The Grange, just in time to have &#x201C;her judgement commuted&#x201C; (<date when="1858-01-18">18</date>). Nero is ill. Neuberg in particular helps TC with proofreading <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi> JWC gratified to receive pictures of Haddington from Lady Kinloch, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">crying,</hi> these ten minutes like a little Girl&#x201C; (<date when="1858-01-27">27</date>). JWC acknowledges <hi rend="italic">Scenes of Clerical Life</hi> in a letter <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580121-JWC-GEL-01">to George Eliot</ref> beginning &#x201C;Dear Sir&#x201C; (<date when="1858-01-21">21</date>). TC, on his return to Chelsea, tackles some ninety pages of proofs, and finds the masons troublesome as they repair the fireplaces.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1858-02-00">February.</date></hi> JWC &#x201C;still a close prisoner&#x201C; with the cold (<date when="1858-02-10">10</date>) and intensely irritated by the servant, Anne, with whom relations have broken down; Anne is to leave at the end of March. Emilie Hawkes is painting JWC for a Royal Exhibition show. Geraldine Jewsbury is a frequent visitor. She wants to talk about Walter Mantell, but JWC will not allow it. TC writes a testimonial for Thomas Ballantyne <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580214-TC-LG-01">to Lord Grey</ref>, presumably to help Ballantyne to raise money for the <hi rend="italic">Statesman</hi> (<date when="1858-02-14">14</date>). He thanks Larkin for his work on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> and warns him he will be needed for the index to volume 2 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1858-02-15">15</date>). Neuberg is busy throughout with research, and Larkin with maps, for <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1858-03-00">March.</date></hi> TC describes <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi> as the best modern book there is on education (<date when="1858-03-03">3</date>). TC, declining invitation from Lady Stanley (<date when="1858-03-09">9</date>), begins gathering data for the corrections to the reprint of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (<date when="1858-03-21">21</date>): the printers are &#x201C;sluggish to a pitch&#x201C; (<date when="1858-03-23">23</date>), and &#x201C;I never was so solitary intrinsically&#x201C; (<date when="1858-03-26">26</date>). JWC has a relapse of cold (<date when="1858-03-25">25</date>), and the change of servants make it worse. Larkin is &#x201C;a very indispensable blessing&#x201C; to TC in his difficulties (<date when="1858-03-26">26</date>). On the day the new servant, Miss Cameron, starts, TC is invited (to Jane&#x2019;s relief) to Addiscombe by Lord Ashburton (<date when="1858-03-29">29</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1858-04-00">April.</date></hi> TC returns to Cheyne Row (<date when="1858-04-01">1</date>) and finds the new servant satisfactory to JWC, though inexperienced. Larkin&#x2019;s brother offers to engrave the maps for <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi> JWC tries to persuade David Davidson to come to London to serve on a committee for Indian questions. The new servant suddenly absconds and leaves the Carlyles servantless (<date when="1858-04-15">15</date>). TC, &#x201C;on my last Chapter&#x201C; of first part of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> envisages completion at the end of May, and promises himself a long rest (<date when="1858-04-16">16</date>). The cheap edition is almost finished. TC, thanking Mont&#xE9;gut for some French volumes, asks for specialist works on Frederick (<date when="1858-04-16">16</date>). TC dines at Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s where Tyndall says that he and TC were &#x201C;the most joyful pair at the table.&#x201C; He receives a picture of Frederick by Francke from William Warren Vernon (<date when="1858-04-22">22</date>). JWC sends family photographs, unframed, to Mary Austin and promises to bring frames later.</p>
<p><pb id="lastpage-33-xxxvi" n="33:xxxvi"/><hi rend="italic"><date when="1858-05-00">May.</date></hi> <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior</hi> exhibited at the Royal Academy (preview, <date when="1858-05-01">1</date>; public opening, <date when="1858-05-03">3</date>). The Carlyles go to Addiscombe for a rest (<date when="1858-05-03">3</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-05-10">10</date>), JWC&#x2019;s health steadily improving; TC has almost finished the copy for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1858-05-02">2</date>): &#x201C;Truly I am quite worn out.&#x201C; He rides with Lord Ashburton and his health improves; he contemplates a trip to Scotland. JWC uses her leisure to write to Betty Braid in Edinburgh and to Charlotte Southam, age sixteen, her temporary maid in Chelsea (<date when="1858-05-08">8</date>). JWC asks their neighbor Anne Gilchrist to give her tuition in baking (<date when="1858-05-15">15</date>) before the arrival of her cousins Maggie and Mary (<date when="1858-05-16">16</date>) for a visit; they come twice to Chelsea (<date when="1858-05-16">16</date>, <date when="1858-05-27">27</date>) but do not stay. Charlotte is installed as permanent maid, &#x201C;such a kindly, <hi rend="italic">human, open</hi> little girl!&#x201C; (ca. <date when="1858-05-16">16</date>). JWC continues a warm correspondence with Mary Russell with exchange of gifts. TC writes to Richard Owen about bones uncovered in excavations in Belgrave Square (<date when="1858-05-17">17</date>) and feels very restless as printing of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> is slow, preventing him from planning a holiday; the last proofs arrive at the end of the month.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1858-06-00">June.</date></hi> TC writes <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580602-TC-RWE-01">to Emerson</ref> in answer to a letter of <date when="1858-05-17">17 May</date>, saying Emerson&#x2019;s friends the Longworths will be welcome at Cheyne Row (<date when="1858-06-02">2</date>). Thomas Woolner invites JWC to Farringford on behalf of Emily Tennyson, but she refuses (<date when="1858-06-03">3</date>). Dickens&#x2019;s separation from his wife, Catherine, is finalized (<date when="1858-06-12">12</date>) and talked about in the newspapers. TC&#x2019;s proofreading, with Chorley&#x2019;s help, is complete (<date when="1858-06-08">8</date>); index and maps all but ready; publication is expected in September in two volumes, but with the number of pages equivalent to three; TC tells Chapman he should be paid accordingly (<date when="1858-06-09">9</date>); he leaves the financial details of bargaining with Chapman to John Forster (<date when="1858-06-11">11</date>). The weather turns hot; TC writes in the garden at Chelsea under an awning (<date when="1858-06-12">12</date>) and wishes to leave for the countryside and find quarters for his horse, contemplating a steamer from Liverpool to Scotsbrig, and considering a visit to Whitby to see a house they have been offered as a seaside retreat (<date when="1858-06-18">18</date>). Both Carlyles go briefly to Albury (<date when="1858-06-19">19</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-06-21">21</date>) to visit Henry Drummond. TC finally sets off for Scotland (<date when="1858-06-23">23</date>), directly by the west coast line, abandoning the visit to Whitby and making overnight for the Gill (<date when="1858-06-24">24</date>). JWC writes <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580627-JWC-TC-01">to TC</ref> about the price of Tait&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Chelsea Interior</hi> picture, which Lord Ashburton has bought (<date when="1858-06-27">27</date>), and relaxes in peace at Cheyne Row, enjoying being &#x201C;well let alone&#x201C; (<date when="1858-06-27">27</date>). TC sends a friendly letter <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580628-TC-JSM-01">to John Stuart Mill</ref> (<date when="1858-06-28">28</date>) and an apologetic letter <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580628-TC-JWC-01">to JWC</ref> (<date when="1858-06-28">28</date>) for his bad temper in the London heat; his sister Jean visits him at the Gill &#x201C;nothing like so cheery &#x26; merry as she once was&#x201C; (<date when="1858-06-30">30</date>). He writes letters of recommendation for A. J. Scott, who is hoping to lecture in the United States (<date when="1858-06-30">30</date>).</p>

<salute>My dear Isabella</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your kind note; it was brought from Kircaldy yesterday by the <hi rend="italic">Precentor,</hi> and the letters were sent back by him, when he had done his little job of singing; before I was told or had time to write an answer.</p>
<p>Dont vex your kind hearts about not being able to ask me to Scotsbrig. I am not up to scouring the Country and visiting here there and every where, as I did last year&#x2014; I could not have gone into Dumfrieshire, without staying some time at Mrs Russells, who has been pressing me to come there, ever since I got about after my long confinement. And I should have had to stop at Dumfries, and stop at the Gill<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit Jean and James Aitken and James and Mary Austin.</note>&#x2014;wet day or dry,&#x2014;and all that <hi rend="italic">tashing</hi>&#x2014;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wearying with hard work, or, in JWC&#x2019;s usage, with visiting.</note> about&#x2014;that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">toiling myself</hi>&#x201C; as our old Betty<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Betty Braid, although Isabella would not have known her personally; more probably Betty Smail, dependant at Scotsbrig.</note> calls it&#x2014;would have knocked me up <hi rend="italic">at present</hi> body and soul&#x2014; So I had made up my mind to stay still as much as possible in one quarter of the Country&#x2014; Indeed if I could have done it without mortally offending my Aunts and my Cousins I would have spent my whole time at Sunny Bank&#x2014; However I am going back there for another week or so of my &#x201C;native air&#x201C; before I return to Chelsea&#x2014; If I were there own Child these dear old women couldn&#x2019;t be kinder to me than they are&#x2014;and their quiet and regular way of life is just suited to an Invalid&#x2014;as I am afraid I must still call myself&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> there is too <hi rend="italic">much ado about nothing</hi> and, the hours are too <hi rend="italic">fashionable</hi> for me&#x2014; Whether owing to that or not I cant tell; but I have been more unwell than I was at SunnyBank and as <hi rend="italic">this</hi> journey to Scotland is not one of <hi rend="italic">pleasure,</hi> or of idleness, or of restlessness; but wholly and solely with a view to getting a little stronger, and more able to carry on life <hi rend="italic">at home.</hi> the fact that I am not so well is reason enough for shortening my stay&#x2014;next week I mean to be at Haddington again.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C seems to be getting on pretty well by himself&#x2014; If I had not been sure that Ann could and would keep him right in <hi rend="italic">material</hi> respects I couldnt have made up my mind to leave him there&#x2014; He is very considerate anyhow in making no complaints in his letters.</p>
<p>My kindest regards to dear Jamie&#x2014; I should like to have had a sight of his honest face&#x2014;and a drive in the old gig with him, could it have been managed but it couldnt&#x2014;had my room been lying ever so vacant, I couldnt have faced <pb id="pg-33-8" n="33:8"/>in my present state of nerves&#x2014;all that tashing about&#x2014; I will send you a line when I get home, to tell you how far my journey has been worth the pains and cost&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear little soul,</salute> I was much disappointed yesterday at 2 o&#x2019;clock, and kept hoping all the time till 8: but today, first thing in the morning, your good kind Letter came, and all your news;&#x2014;none of the best, alas: but I am glad at any rate that you make your bits of complaints freely to me;&#x2014;if not to me, to whom else now alive on the Earth? Oh never distrust me, as the Devil sometimes tempts your poor heart to do! I know you for an honest soul (far too sharp-tempered, but <hi rend="italic">true</hi> to the bone); and if I ever am or was unkind to you, God knows it is was<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> far, very far, against my purpose! Do not distrust me; tell me everything; and never mind how &#x201C;weak&#x201C; you are before me: I know y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> strength and y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> weakness very well by this time! Poor little Goody.</p>
<p>You will have to leave Auchtertool, I perceive, directly on the back of that insipid offspring&#x2019;s arrival: your Aunts are by nature the next resource. Could not you manage <hi rend="italic">bathing,</hi> sea-bathing, with <hi rend="italic">Morningside</hi> for lodging? Plenty of trains go to Portobello: I do not like to think of you in lonesome Bathing-quarters, there or in the Haddington region. And you are not for Dumfriesshire at all? Well: who knows? I was going to advise the <hi rend="italic">avoidance</hi> of that Haddington Parting, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be sad on both sides. But I suppose it must be. Inexorable <hi rend="small-caps">Time:</hi> how he cuts all away from us, and (happily) ourselves along with it at last.&#x2014; End of the account is, were this blaze of heat well over, perhaps your own shop, beside poor me, will be the best harbour of all. It is indeed frightfully hot; and I am often glad you are out of it: but probably this fit will be the last of the Year. Sha&#x2019;n&#x2019;t<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> I be glad to see you back again? Yes, for a considerable number of reasons,&#x2014;when you resolve upon it as the eligible thing to do! Yet don&#x2019;t hurry at all; now that you are in the adventure, do the very utmost of it. &#x201C;Cortachy Castle&#x201C; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have given you, on certain terms, another week of country; but perhaps you are wise to decline such a <pb id="pg-33-9" n="33:9"/>bother, consisting of little but ceremony after all. Fergusdom, too, I perceive, is not recommendable. Scotsbrig&#x2014;I could send for John <hi rend="italic">hither;</hi> that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take him completely out of the way, if nothing else would; and you might be abundantly quiet and right there; <hi rend="italic">well let alone,</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441007-JWC-HW-01"><sic>18:231</sic><corr>JWC to HW, [<date when="1844-10-07">7 Oct. 1844</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> as hardly anywhere else.

      <salute>Oh my Dear!</salute>
       I am going to put you off with another scrap; tho besides my promise of a deliberate letter today, there is come a nice good letter from you to be answered. It is not physical inability however that hinders at present. I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> last night after my &#x0201C;dreadful gripe,&#x0201D; and feel better, for the moment. But just before your letter came, Walter offered me a drive to Kircaldy, and as I cant take walking exercise just now, I thought a drive would be a &#x0201C;great advantage&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Coterie speech; see Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:9.</note> besides that it would give &#x0201C;an opportunity to the Post office,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the London Mail came in.

<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> I am so sorry!&#x2014; To think of your having been all alone there with Ann &#x201C;dreadfully ill&#x201C;! As it has turned out, it was better that you did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> tell me; for certainly I should have at once flown off to the rescue, and arrived only to complicate your difficulties by falling &#x201C;dreadfully ill&#x201C; myself. Still, the confidence in all being <hi rend="small-caps">well</hi> (figuratively speaking), so long as I hear nothing to the contrary, is <hi rend="italic">done for</hi> by this concealment. So it will be for my peace of mind to be making no further move that is not a move homeward.

I have not <hi rend="italic">named</hi> any time for my stay at Morningside; will &#x201C;leave it open&#x201C; (as you say) but even should I thrive there, I don&#x2019;t think of more than a week; and <pb id="pg-33-15" n="33:15"/>another week at Sunny Bank will make as much &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">outing</hi>&#x201C; as should suffice for this year!&#x2014; For the rest I may give <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> the same comfort about my travels that I used to give <hi rend="italic">you</hi> about your horse, when you were saying it did you &#x201C;next to no good&#x201C;; I &#x201C;can&#x2019;t tell <hi rend="italic">how much worse</hi>&#x201C; I should have been, had I stayed thro&#x2019; all that heat of London!&#x2014; Certainly I have had nothing to suffer from heat&#x2014;whatever else.</p>

We cannot print these narratives.&#x201C; There were several massacres of Europeans in June and July but the most notorious was <date when="1857-07-16">16 July 1857</date>, when 197 women and children were killed at the Bibigarh compound, Cawnpore, a military station on the Ganges, 100 mi.

Anne is perfectly well again; her Mother too;&#x02014;she really goes on very well in her place here, bathes Nero every morning, feeds the Canaries with their green and other fodder; bakes excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> bread (is cooking me a <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> today);&#x02014;and I hope will have a good acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to render.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got both your Letters in succession; and need not say that they were welcome to me. For some time I have been waiting the day which has now come (the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of a certain bit of work) that I might answer a word or two: and this very morning there arrives this Note from Tom in Canada,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander&#x2019;s eldest son, Thomas.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is also a thing needing to be forwarded. That blazing Steamer under the cliffs of Quebec: Alas, I did not know there was anybody in the remotest way connected with our affairs who was there;&#x2014;I sometimes asked the question in my mind, too, and here it is answered! I did not know the poor Hanning lass nor her husband at all.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The steamer <hi rend="italic">Montreal,</hi> on its way from Quebec to Montreal, had caught fire in the St. Lawrence River, <date when="1857-06-26">26 June</date>. It was carrying many Scottish emigrants just arrived on the <hi rend="italic">John Mackenzie</hi> from the Clyde &#x201C;[w]hen about an hour out &#x2026; smoke was seen to rise from about midships, over the saloon, and in less than 10 minutes the vessel was a mass of flames&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1857-07-13">13 July</date>). Another report told of the swamping of the ship&#x2019;s lifeboat and looting of corpses (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1857-07-16">16 July</date>). An inquest later put the number of those killed at 248; Robert Hanning&#x2019;s niece and family were among them (see also <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570813-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1857-08-13">13 Aug.</date></ref>). They were Jane, b. Hanning (Henning in the register of her children&#x2019;s births) (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>), and Bryce Hall; their children were William (<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>), Catherine (<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>), Simon (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>), Robert (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>) (all recorded as b. in Annan), and Peter and Margaret whose birth dates are not known. They are all included in the list of those who died on the <hi rend="italic">Montreal</hi> (with the father named as Bruce Hall) (<hi rend="italic">Toronto Globe and Mail,</hi> <date when="1857-07-02">2 July 1857</date>).</note> Of course it will be a great grief in Jenny&#x2019;s House; nothing can be fancied more hideous (except perhaps our present Indian matters!) than the whole thing looked to me in the Newspapers.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-33-19" n="33:19"/>And poor Mary Little:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Little (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>) of Cressfield, Hoddam; see also <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480919-TC-JAC-01"><sic>23:114</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1848-09-19">19 Sept. 1848</date></corr></ref>.</note> the last time I can remember to have spoken with her was, wading in the Burn (children probably ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 7 and 6), fishing for minnows, or picking up &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dowie-stanes</hi>&#x201C; after a flood: nothing can be clearer than that picture in my memory;&#x2014;and after half a century and more, the gates have closed. Poor Tom Garthwaite, too, my fancy has often seen his grave in Hoddam Kirkyard since you mentioned his departure.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Garthwaite (ca. <date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), Hoddam farmer, d. <date when="1857-02-21">21 Feb.</date>; not TC&#x2019;s tailor of the same name (ca. <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1894-00-00">94</date>).</note> One goes after another; and the big Ball of Earth is getting very solitary for some of us.</p>
<p>My Printing goes on here,&#x2014;after endless retardations, abstruse settlements and preliminaries;&#x2014;but it is now actually under way (2 sheets, or 1&#xBD; as minimum, per week); and I have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> a scantling of pages, 150 or so, <hi rend="italic">altogether off my hands for-ever and a day!</hi> That is truly a consolatory feeling. If I can hold out for about another year, the <hi rend="italic">first part</hi> (9 tenths of the whole, in point of labour) will be loose from me: fair wind and full sea to it,&#x2014;I never wish to hear of it again in Time or Eternity!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane leaves Auchtertool, Thurday<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> next; comes over to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to her Aunts again, and perhaps to a touch of seabathing, for a week; then back to Haddington, to take leave, according to promise: I compute she may be with me again about the end of the month. She does not appear to be at all strong, far enough from it; but is perhaps not quite so weak as she was.&#x2014; Farie has run off to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on the sudden, after endless speculating.

<p><salute>Dear Sister,&#x2014;</salute>I got your Letter duly; and am obliged to you, as always: I get very little news from anybody out of poor old Scotland now except you.&#x2014; It was very clever in poor Tom<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her son.</note> to recognise (with no <hi rend="italic">face,</hi> I think, at all) in that Photograph! He has a quick judgement poor soul; if he can but make it into a <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> one too, it may richly make amends to him for the other drawbacks he <pb id="pg-33-20" n="33:20"/>labours under.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom was deaf; A.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>About ten days ago, there came to me a very pretty message from Berlin: a Note from you in the incomparable hand so familiar to me of old, and a beautiful little Book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Ludmilla Assing, Varnhagen&#x2019;s niece; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570801-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1857-08-01">1 Aug.</date></ref></note> which entertained me greatly for several evenings after. I am truly glad to get a word from you, in assurance of the old disposition towards me, and marking that you are still well and active; such things grow ever more precious as one grows more solitary in this world,&#x2014;inexorable <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> more and more exercising his sad privilege upon us! Do not forget me; nor will I you,&#x2014;amid the wrecks that go on around us.</p>
<p>The Book is altogether delightful reading: I have sent it on, the instant it was finished here, to my Wife, who has run into Scotland during the heats, and who I dare say is busy now upon it. Nothing can be more gracefully thrown off, with perfect clearness too, so far as the circumstances permitted. It gives me curious glimpses into the latest chapter of your Berlin Histories, which was quite dark to me before. Immermann &#x26;c I had heard of; but only as rumours of Names; I never read anything of Imm<hi rend="italic">n;</hi>&#x2014;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the manuscript, TC denotes &#x201C;mm&#x201C; with m plus macron.</note>nor does this Narrative give me much appetite to him: he plays but a sorry figure here.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Following her divorce, Countess von L&#xfc;tzow lived with but refused to marry Karl Immermann; he m., <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, Marianne Niemeyer (b. <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>), grandda. of August Hermann Niemeyer (<date when="1754-00-00">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), chancellor and rector of Halle Univ.</note> On the whole, a tragic Female History throughout; things all gone awry, in that and other departments, and no immediate prospect of their coming right again! But the <hi rend="italic">Gr&#xE4;finn</hi> [countess] herself is very beautiful, in her sorrows and otherwise; a fine clear Being,&#x2014;clear, sharp, as if she were made of <hi rend="italic">steel.</hi> Perhaps there are other good Books upon that <hi rend="italic">Frei-Schaar</hi> [volunteer troop] of L&#xfc;tzow&#x2019;s, and the human aspects of the <hi rend="italic">Befreiungskrieg</hi> [war of independence] in Prussia?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Von L&#xfc;tzow was a Prussian army officer who commanded the volunteer &#x201C;Freikorps&#x201C; in the war of liberation against Napoleon I, <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-00-00">14</date>; the exploits of the corps were celebrated by one of its members, the poet Theodor K&#xF6;rner (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>), in &#x201C;L&#xfc;tzow&#x2019;s wilde Jagd&#x201C; (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>), set to music by Carl Maria von Weber in <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>.</note> They would be welcome to me, if they are at all like this present one,&#x2014;had I gone into a little leisure again. The last <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> in the Book, about digging up the Friend&#x2019;s body, and bringing it home to natal earth,&#x2014;has a grim pathos, and silent <hi rend="italic">Tapferkeit</hi> [bravery] and <hi rend="italic">Redlichkeit</hi> [sincerity] that goes into one&#x2019;s very heart.&#x2014; Ask the fair Authoress, If she has not other Books perhaps, of the like quality, lying in her heart!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Assing published <hi rend="italic">Sophie von La Roche, die Freundin Wieland&#x2019;s</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), a biography of the novelist Sophie von La Roche, b. Gutermann (<date when="1731-00-00">1731</date>&#x2013;<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>).</note> You can <pb id="pg-33-22" n="33:22"/>assure her, with my respectful homages, That I find this one a Book extremely well worth writing, and well worth reading.</p>
<p>For months and years past I have been sunk as man seldom was, in the dismallest <hi rend="italic">Stygian</hi> regions, struggling with this Unblessed Task of mine, which I have often thought would kill me outright. You called it a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">gewaltiges</hi> [powerful, violent]&#x201C; subject; I have often bethought me of that term,&#x2014;and that, if I had been twenty years <hi rend="italic">younger,</hi> it might have suited better! But no, there is no help;&#x2014;struggle thro&#x2019; to the farther side, or else drown: that is the condition.&#x2014; We are now at last fairly <hi rend="italic">at Press;</hi> slowly <hi rend="italic">printing,</hi>&#x2014;I flying slowly ahead.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I had a pleasant and kind Letter from you not very long ago; awakening manifold affectionate remembrances, and echoes of old times and things, in my mind: I have ever since been thinking from time to time that I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> send an Answer &#x201C;soon&#x201C;;&#x2014;yet, such is the pressure of my affairs, and such my own hurried weak condition, no answer comes till now; and indeed, of late weeks, I have been looking forward to <hi rend="italic">this</hi> as the real time for it,&#x2014;namely, the day&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">holiday</hi> I was to give myself on finishing a certain Section of my sad Book; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> feat has now been brought about at last. The day before yesterday I got a very welcome good little Letter from Tom (thank him for me); but this w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have come on its own score, had there been no new reason.</p>
<p>Ever since I wrote last year from Scotsbrig,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561003-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1856-10-03">3 Oct. 1856</date></ref>.</note> I have been working like a slave; day and night involved in confusions, of the most unmanageable nature;&#x2014;the only limit, not to break <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> down altogether, in which case there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be no hope of the job. Never in my life had I a thing so difficult to do; and I am fallen old, and <hi rend="italic">feckless</hi> in comparison; <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> much dead in me, especially: not <hi rend="italic">fit</hi> to handle such huge mountains of rubbish;&#x2014;yet dreadfully unwilling to be beaten by them, too! Being withal in the most evident state of special ill-health, <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than even naturally belongs to me at this age, I decided on getting a Horse again;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fritz; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561119-TC-JAC-01"><sic>32:31</sic>TC to JAC, <date when="1856-11-19">19 Nov. 1856</date></ref>.</note> have had a Horse since November last; and go riding daily as the Sun; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> does (I sometimes think) begin to tell on me at last, or at least prevents me getting still <hi rend="italic">worse:</hi>&#x2014;and so I fight along; and hope fairly to finish this frightful job too; after which I contemplate <hi rend="italic">taking a rest</hi> for the remainder of my life, or mainly &#x201C;a rest.&#x201C; This is a fine brisk Horse I have got (now into my <hi rend="italic">third</hi> thousand of miles, riding upon him &#x201C;after health&#x201C;): how often did I think of my poor true Alick who used to buy me horses, and do all things for me, in old days! The poor <hi rend="italic">Cutlugs</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;cutluggit,&#x201C; meaning &#x201C;cropped ears&#x201C;; see William A. Craigie, <hi rend="italic">A Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue</hi> (<date when="1937-00-00">1937</date>) vol. 1.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you bought for &#xa3;2"10 at Mainhill<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The farm about 2 mi. NW of Ecclefechan where the Carlyle family lived, <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>; see vols. 1&#x2013;3.</note> (do you remember it?), I often think, almost like to cry, of that poor <hi rend="italic">Snaffle;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">SND</hi> cites TC as using &#x201C;snaffle&#x201C; as a nickname.</note> &#x26; would not give the memory of it for the price of the best Horse now alive! My dear Brother, I know that your affection for me lasts and has <pb id="pg-33-24" n="33:24"/>lasted, faithful to the end: you need not doubt that mine towards you is, was, and will be the like. That is a mournful but blessed possession for us both, wherever we be in this world.&#x2014; But the best news of myself I must give too; namely that I am fairly <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> that unspeakable New Book; 150 pages of it <hi rend="italic">off my hands</hi> forevermore; and if I can hold out wisely I shall verily do it, and get rid of it, one day, in a not discreditable manner! For years back, I have had hardly any other wish left. About this time twelvemonth, if I can go on neither too <hi rend="italic">fast</hi> nor too slow, I expect to be rid of Three Volumes;&#x2014;there will remain then, after such pause as I like, other Two Volumes,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> eventually pbd. in 6 vols.; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560505-TC-JCA-01"><sic>31:81</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1856-05-05">5 May 1856</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561219-TC-JN-01"><sic>32:55&#x2013;56</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1856-12-19">19 Dec. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> and not the tenth part of the difficulty in <hi rend="italic">them.</hi> Steady, therefore; &#x201C;steady!&#x201C; as the drill serjeants say.</p>
<p>My poor Jane took a cold last year, two or three weeks after returning home with me; and could not get out of it again,&#x2014;ill and weak in a high degree, often confined to bed (never out of doors at all), dreadfully off for want of sleep especially,&#x2014;all winter thro&#x2019;. In my hurries this was (to her, still more than to myself perhaps) a great aggravation. Not till the end of May could she get out again; and still she continued far below par in strength,&#x2014;and I fear, continues so in some sensible degree. There appeared to me to be nothing <hi rend="italic">specifically wrong</hi> with her; merely the crisis or summing up of a long tract of sickly sleeplessness &#x26;c &#x26;c which was come to a head: perhaps she might be a thought <hi rend="italic">better</hi> even, could she once gather strength again. Above a month ago, being pressingly invited by the old Misses Donaldson (whom perhaps you remember), she went to Haddington; thence over into Fife (to her cousin Walter of Liverpool, who is a clergyman there,&#x2014;poor kind &#x201C;Uncle John&#x201C; of Liverpool is dead several years ago): she is, this very day I think, coming over to Edinburgh to her Aunts (Grace &#x26;c, who live there, in fine suburban air &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Craigen</hi> Villa&#x201C;, and are grown very good old Dames, of a strongly <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> turn); after a week with her Aunts she goes back to Haddington,&#x2014;thence <hi rend="italic">home</hi> to me; I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fancy, about the beginning of Sept<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> She does not appear to have gained much in strength, poor little soul; but we hope she will find herself really profited (as has sometimes been my own case) on getting into her old place, and summing the whole up, as then happens. I used to liken myself to an old <hi rend="italic">garron</hi> whose harness, collar &#x26;c, had worn it into &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">raws</hi>&#x201C;:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s word for sores.</note> going 300 miles off, you get into <hi rend="italic">new harness;</hi> which likewise hurts you: but on resuming the old harness, the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">raws</hi>&#x201C; are found somewhat mended nevertheless!&#x2014;</p>
<p>John has not been here, or away from Scotsbrig, since soon after Newyearsday last. He came up hither about that time; to dispose of some troublesome tho&#x2019; occasionally profitable <hi rend="italic">shares in a Ship,</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; presumably part of his wife Phoebe&#x2019;s estate.</note> which had been <pb id="pg-33-25" n="33:25"/>bequeathed to him: this he successfully da very wise act), and soon after returned to Scotsbrig. There he seems not to be doing much,&#x2014;selling off old bequeathed Libraries (<hi rend="italic">at Chester</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >County town of Cheshire on the river Dee, 34 mi. SW of Manchester; possibly connected with his wife&#x2019;s estate.</note> this, by Letter sent from Scotsbrig); corresponding with or about his &#x201C;four <hi rend="italic">wards</hi>&#x201C; (rather indifferent subjects than otherwise I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> judge), occasionally having some of them with him there, &#x26;c &#x26;c;&#x2014;he does not speak of setting up a House of his own, tho&#x2019; now abundantly wealthy for that; seems to keep much at home about Scotsbrig; and to be healthy and contented there. He is a placid sanguine creature; looking always at the &#x201C;sunny side of his cloud&#x201C; (as our dear old Mother used to say);&#x2014;and has a much more satisfied life than some others of us.</p>
<p>Dumfriesshire and all places are what they call &#x201C;prospering&#x201C; at present: many circumstances perhaps (the California gold, I privately reckon, most of all)<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Half a million people from all round the world had descended on California following the discovery of gold at Coloma, nr. Sacramento, <date when="1848-01-24">24 Jan. 1848</date>. The rich surface mines were largely exhausted by <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>, and river mining then dominated, though occasional discoveries continued to attract fortune hunters. Cf. <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521031-JWC-KS-01"><sic>27:346</sic><corr>JWC to KS, [<date when="1852-10-31">31 Oct. 1852</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> have given such an explosive impulse to &#x201C;trade,&#x201C; all corners of this Country are testifying [to] it.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> To me it is by no means exclusively beautiful, this enormous effulgence of wealth, and with it of luxury and gaudery and folly, on the part not of the <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> men of the community (for it is not they that the &#x201C;wealth&#x201C; mainly falls on):&#x2014;it is on the contrary inexpressibly <hi rend="italic">ugly</hi> to me when I reflect on it; and I perceive that the Devil is in it, he in fact and no Saint! However, that is the course at present; all things rising in price; all manner of gamblers getting &#x201C;fortunes&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c: and by and by there will be a very <hi rend="italic">burbly</hi> account to settle indeed!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A monetary crisis in <date when="1857-11-00">Nov.</date> and large-scale unemployment and distress in the manufacturing districts of Stockport, Oldham, and Manchester severely undermined confidence in the financial system; a number of banks and trading houses were suspended (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571115-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1857-11-15">15 Nov.</date></ref>).</note> I often think, for myself and you, we are better <hi rend="italic">not concerned</hi> in it: I just above the fear of poverty and nothing more; you ditto, with your own bit of the Earth&#x2019;s surface secured for a field of honest industry to your children and you. There are more <hi rend="italic">secrets</hi> in Heaven&#x2019;s ways of doing &#x201C;kindness&#x201C; to men, than men are always aware of.&#x2014; At The Gill, at Scotsbrig they are in health, I think; Jamie a very good farmer (I perceive) and respectable honest man; things going the right road, with more money-profit than formerly, at The Gill too. Of Jean at Dumfries, a sim[ilar]<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> account is to be given:&#x2014;&#x201C;all well&#x201C; was the word two days ago.</p>
<p>Poor old Graham at Burnswark continues bodily in excellent health his Sister extremely frail; but both of them, he especially, much sunk in mind <pb id="pg-33-26" n="33:26"/>from what they were. In Miss Graham, I thought, it was mostly depression and darkness from ill health: but with him, <hi rend="italic">memory</hi> is quite gone for practical purposes,&#x2014;and this too is about the sum of the matter, for his &#x201C;intellect,&#x201C; by itself, seemed much the same as ever when I saw him last year. John goes up from time to time; but finds it a very sad monotony I think, and has never the least change to report.</p>
<p>Tom&#x2019;s Letter yesterday gave me a sad glimpse into that Emigrant Steamer that took fire in your River! I had read the thing in the Newspapers with a very miserable feeling, for it seemed to be mere neglect and want of sense: but I did not know there was anybody we were specially concerned in there. Poor Jenny &#x26; her Household may well think with a strange shock of that poor Annandale Sister &#x26; her Goodman:<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane (Robert Hanning&#x2019;s niece) and Bryce Hall, who d. because of the burning and the sinking of the <hi rend="italic">Montreal</hi> on the St. Lawrence; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570811-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1857-08-11">11 Aug.</date></ref></note> Horrible indeed!&#x2014; Give my affectionate regards to Jenny the first opportunity you have: if I were once a little more my own master, she shall hear from me again. Also to your own Jane, &#x201C;Jane the Second&#x201C;;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Welsh Sims, named after JWC.</note>&#x2014;I can never think of her except as of a little child good at reading; and she has got a long way out of that!&#x2014;</p>
<p>There was an account from Tom (I think to the Dr in winter last) about an adventure in <hi rend="italic">Maple Sugar</hi> with his Brother-in-law;<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Sims, Jane&#x2019;s husband.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I read with much interest. The two rugged sons of Nature reading <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> in the Bush, while their pans boiled, made an admirable picture to me,&#x2014;full of health, and rugged honest life and worth. I once tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to have written to Tom specially a word under this Cover: but on the whole, it will not now do; and you can tell him all I specifically had to say. Two other Volumes are ready for him here (one comes generally <hi rend="italic">monthly</hi><note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For those vols. of the cheap edn. of TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> pbd. by the end of Aug., see <ref target="volume-32/ed-32-athanaeum-advertisements"><sic>32:215&#x2013;17</sic><corr>Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s Advertisements</corr></ref>.</note>); I think I shall wait till there is a third then off with them.

<p>My packing is just finished Dear&#x2014; my dinner will be up in five Minutes&#x2014;and then I am off to Kircaldy to catch the three oclock train.

Reciting or reading in a high shrieky tone the original of Werner, she exclaimed passionately, at every turn, &#x2018;But where is the Child of Glory?&#x2019; and got no answer, except in assenting smiles and long-continued remembrance.&#x2014;T.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I meant to have written you this fraction of a word yesterday, but had not time when the hour came. Jane got certain of those Photographs sent her; one was to be given to Isabella, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> probably Jane has sent; if not, she will. A better set are promised by Tait: when these are realised (likely not for some time yet), I will not forget Scotsbrig.&#x2014; Jane is come across to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> again; thence to Haddington (end of next week, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">this</hi> week&#x201C; for you,&#x2014;most probably); thence, after short delay, <hi rend="italic">home.</hi> Which I shall be very glad of,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I do not amiss in my Housekeeping either. But the solitude is <hi rend="italic">deep;</hi> and, tho&#x2019; profitable perhaps not a little in some ways, one does not always love it for the moment! We have very thundery, wet &#x26; yet sultry weather: difficult to work an evening&#x2019;s ride out of it without a wetting,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> latter, however, I have escaped hitherto.</p>
<p>You might have had the old <hi rend="italic">revises</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> proofs after revision; see also <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570815-TC-CRO-01">TC to <sic>CR</sic><corr>CRO</corr>, <date when="1857-08-15">15 Aug.</date></ref></note> at once, if you had spoken in time: <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are no great prize! But the first half dozen are gone to the winds now; nor have I got any <hi rend="italic">perfect copy</hi> yet; so that I see not well how to supply you,&#x2014;or give you a fair start. After some survey, I think it will be best to bid <hi rend="italic">Mr Larkin</hi> (an exceedingly useful volunteer man here, doing &#x2018;maps,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin recalled the &#x201C;misery&#x201C; he endured in this period making maps for TC: &#x201C;The method was, I took the printer&#x2019;s &#x2018;slips&#x2019; or &#x2018;proofs,&#x2019; or sometimes his own rough copy, and read carefully, with the German map spread before me. I had to verify every step taken, and every place described or mentioned; and then accurately select such portions of country and such details as were necessary to illustrate the given description. With the battle-plans the problem was greatly more abstruse. In this case, I had to gather into my own mind, from the given description &#x2026; an accurate picture of the plan of battle, and of the arrangement of the opposing forces, generally at the moment of attack; and then, with a few strokes and dots here and there on an insignificant-looking bit of map, indicate their several positions. If any one should think this an easy task, with an eye like Carlyle&#x2019;s to scan it when done, I would like to see him try to do it&#x201C; (Larkin, <hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 42).</note> doing &#x26;c &#x26;c, and who is furnished with the sheets for business purposes),&#x2014;to bid Mr Larkin send you his stock; upon condition of your sending them back to him, so soon as you have read them. That will be easy: I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think there are only about 7 yet come to him; and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One penny.</note> will frank them. His address then is, &#x2018;Henry Larkin Esq / 3. St John&#x2019;s Villas / Highbury / London&#x2019;:&#x2014;I write to him today; and it is probable you will get the Sheets on Tuesday. I will bid him put his <hi rend="italic">name</hi> on the outside of the Packet, and do you the like in returning it (after a day or two) to him; there will be no need of farther writing, by that method.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-33-29" n="33:29"/>This week I meant to take mostly as a holiday: but there has come such a pressure of confused &#x2018;sheets&#x2019; and &#x2018;Slips,&#x2019; and I have had so many Letters &#x26;c to write,&#x2014;I have got no holiday at all! The correcting of the Press (with these unblessed Lumbers of Indexless German Books to hunt among &#x26;c &#x26;c) is exceedingly laborious. Chorley from this point, after much dubitation on my part, and eager offering on his, is to have a <hi rend="italic">revise</hi> sent him to read along with me in the final state. I suppose he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> pick out a wrong spelling or two, and be of use;&#x2014;but, on the whole, needing <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> so very much, I was not anxious for it.&#x2014; I shall be right glad to see you again, if Henry&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Watt.</note> business or any other cause bring you up. <closer><salute>With affectionate regards to one and all&#x2014; Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A Brother of mine in the Country wants to see the Printed Sheets (last <hi rend="italic">revises,</hi> or whatever they are) of this Book on <hi rend="italic">Fr</hi>h; and I have received only &#x201C;Sheet H&#x201C; (pp. 97&#x2013;113) in the &#x201C;perfect&#x201C; state, and have thrown away all the <hi rend="italic">revises.</hi> I see nothing for it but to refer him to you, to give him a fair start in the matter.</p>
<p>Will you please, therefore, bundle up what sheets you have; address them: &#x201C;Dr Carlyle / Scotsbrig / Ecclefechan N.B&#x201C;; writing your own name on the outside, and sticking-on that penny stamp: they will go to my Brother in half-a-day; he, after a day or two, will return them to your Address;&#x2014;and if you tell me, any time, <hi rend="italic">how far</hi> your stock went, I shall be able to do the rest of the Affair myself with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> trouble.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Dr Carlyle<lb/>
Scotsbrig<lb/>
Ecclefechan N. B.&#x201C;</p>
<p>that is again;&#x2014;and so I let you go for this time. No need of posting till <hi rend="italic">Monday,</hi> any hour before 5&#xBD; p.m.</p>

The sea was as smooth as a looking glass, and I wasn&#x2019;t upset the least in the world. When my cab stopt at the gate, here, every body ran out to meet me, three aunts, maid, and the very <hi rend="italic">cat,</hi> with whom I am in high favour; it came purring about my feet, and whipping my leg with its tail. But you needn&#x2019;t say a word of that to Nero. I respect his too sensitive feelings. They made me quite comfortable and got me <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> tea in no time.

<p>Dear Little Goody&#x2019;s Letter came this morning at Breakfast: right glad to hear of a little improvement in her. The getting away from that child-of-glory Scene must be itself a very great consolation. Alas, one can find no place in the Earth where there is any real composure or comfort attainable: one form of folly rules, or if not one form then another! One is best at home after all: and one of the <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> results of going abroad for help is almost always, that one relishes one&#x2019;s own poor shop better.&#x2014; Anne, I notice, is beginning to <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> for you here: and it will be a glad day for Nero and me, among others, when we get you safe back again.</p>
<p>There has occurred a gust of wild weather since I wrote, and properly nothing else at all. On friday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> I rode out, and after putting your Letter in at Sloane Square, proceeded thro&#x2019; the Park, intending for the Hampstead regions at lowest for the Regent&#x2019;s Park. But the sky was grey sultry, bad for riding; and evidently full of wild electricities: by the time I got towards the top of the Park, I perceived Hampstead was far out of the question. At the Marble Arch,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At NE entrance to Hyde Park.</note> there blazed out a long zigzag of fierce lightning seemingly within few yards, and such a peal of thunder instantly as quite alarmed my very Horse. We turned sharp to the left, intending to keep near home; galloped till we got within reach of big trees at least. There fell no rain almost, after all, and I kept riding about for an hour after: but such a Sky for dark gusty fury I have seldom seen.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came to me yesterday morning; and glad I was to get authentic notice of your whereabout again; for nothing definite could be picked up on that head,&#x2014;except that somebody had got a glimpse of you once in Manchester,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly at the Manchester Exhibition of the Art-Treasures of the United Kingdom, <date when="1857-05-05">5 May</date> to <date when="1857-10-24">24 Oct.</date>; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570524-TC-JWC-01"><sic>32:153&#x2013;55</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1857-05-24">24 May</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;since the night I last saw you in Bath House.</p>
<p>You have found Loch Luichart again; but alas it is not the Loch Luichart of last year, nor ever will be again. I remember every bit of it, as if it were shown me in a mirror, from those sad hints you give: and to me also it is a place <pb id="pg-33-35" n="33:35"/>sternly tho&#x2019; beautifully <hi rend="italic">tragic</hi> henceforth, beyond all other places. What you say of Sambo<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s dog.</note> is sadder than tears. Poor dumb creature! I too have been learning more and more almost every day since that 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of May<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The date of Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s death.</note> what the immense amount of the then event was to me,&#x2014;even to me; how much more to those that were nearer! In the very Proofsheets wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the Printer sends me I find every here and there something that was written for one that will now never read it: &#x201C;Work <hi rend="italic">delayed,</hi>&#x201C; as old Samuel said, &#x201C;till most of those whom I wished to please are sunk into the grave; and success and failure are empty sounds.&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Samuel Johnson, end of preface, <hi rend="italic">A Dictionary of the English Language</hi> (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>).</note>&#x2014;But we must not dwell on these things. Nor do you, I am well aware, beyond what you cannot help.</p>
<p>I have been here constant to my sad function, ever since you went; mostly writing (as just now) in the open air, under an <hi rend="italic">Awning</hi> in the little Garden; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I find a much wholesomer method, tho&#x2019; not otherwise recommendable,&#x2014;much time wasted, lugging Books about, &#x26;c. My task continues laborious, disgusting, miserable beyond what I ever had to do before: there is as it were one interest left for me in the world: to get it <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> and then retire into some still corner, the less noise the better, till <hi rend="italic">all</hi> be done.&#x2014; Whether the Book will ever be of the least worth I cannot affirm; but to do the like of it there is not gold enough in California to hire me; and the getting honestly rid of it will be a joy indeed!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Lady Sandwich was mostly hindered of her Addiscombe by the so-called <hi rend="italic">Emperor&#x2019;s</hi> visit to Osborne;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570801-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1857-08-01">1 Aug.</date></ref></note> who accordingly cut me out too, so that I only rode thither one sunday, and returned next morning. The place was beautiful as the Elysian Fields, and had a grand sadness in it to me as of Eternity: I shall never forget the look of skies there that night.</p>
<p>My Wife is come now to Edinburgh again, slowly on her way southward; I expect her home about the end of this month: it is <hi rend="italic">La Trappe</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330907-TC-JWC-01"><sic>6:432</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1833-09-07">7 Sept.</date></corr></ref></note> solitude or more till then. I fear she has not gained very much in health; but yet I think, a little. On these terms we must try the winter again.</p>
<p>This morning a Pamphlet on Indian matters arrived; done by Brigad<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Mackenzie,&#x2014;too much in the Newspaper way.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mackenzie wrote later that her husband pbd. a letter in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> 6 July, its publication helped by &#x201C;the personal influence of Carlyle,&#x201C; under the signature of &#x201C;Miles,&#x201C; in which he blamed the mutiny on &#x201C;the false policy of Government&#x201C;: &#x201C;[T]heir system of centralisation &#x2026; deprived officers of all authority, so that they could neither reward nor punish, thus destroying the tie of personal influence, the only tie which can bind mercenary soldiers to a foreign Government&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Storms and Sunshine of a Soldier&#x2019;s Life</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>] 2:152&#x2013;53). The pamphlet may have been a version of this letter; it perhaps also contained some of the opinions Colin Mackenzie expressed in a letter, <date when="1857-07-06">6 July</date>, to Sir John William Kaye (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>; <ref target="volume-33/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15201"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), a home civil servant in the East India Company: &#x201C;The officers should not only be the representatives of Government as regards the Sepoys, they should be the representatives of the Sepoys as regards Government. Latterly they have not been permitted to act in either capacity, consequently innumerable cases of hardship and wrong have been unredressed. The pay of the men has been cut without explanation, innocent men have been dismissed, incapable native officers and men have been retained when entitled to pension, assistance has been refused to regiments when food was at famine price, and in the case of the cartridges, orders have been given, offensive to the religious feelings of the troops, and all against the earnest, respectful, and repeated remonstrances of their commanding officers&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Storms</hi> 2:154&#x2013;55).

The affairs of this Empire, India one of them, do not look comfortable to me &#x201C;at all, at all!&#x201C; We are <hi rend="italic">learning</hi> what it is to be <hi rend="italic">governed</hi> by a &#x201C;Talking-Apparatus&#x201C;: God grant we may <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> it, and not mislearn, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I some some times<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> doubt!&#x2014; &#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Riding</hi> grows very disagreeable and monotonous; I often wish you were of the party: but you are better employed.

<p>As I was driving out here the night of my arrival; my cab was met by an open carriage with two Ladies in it; one of them had her face turned full on me&#x2014;a tiny face, sharp as a razor with large dark eyes, set off by hair as white as snow, and plenty of it.

The creature&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">skin</hi> is all whole, and his heart too; and it is certain I have not seen him so well any summer. Canaries singing audibly at this moment; two vegetables flourishing (watered by Anne, this morning, <hi rend="italic">superfluously</hi>),&#x2014;trimmed up by me, Sunday last, and very green indeed. That is the real report of things:&#x2014;and as for myself, I am certainly not <hi rend="italic">too</hi> well or comfortable, whatever else may be in excess with me! Nothing is wrong either substantially; but I am getting on <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> with my new &#x201C;Book,&#x201C; in fact cannot begin it at all, such a tumble of Proofsheets has fallen on me,&#x2014;and I lost my <hi rend="italic">new scissors;</hi> fairly vanished 3 or 4 days ago <hi rend="italic">upstairs,</hi> and they will lie so till you come and pick them out!&#x2014; &#x2014; I am now over the Proofs or nearly so; shall be, this night: and all will <hi rend="italic">go</hi> tomorrow if I can manage it. Wrote to Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> yesterday (a short note); sat all day, mainly down <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> hunting in abstruse imbroglios of Books, with a touch of <hi rend="italic">Proofs</hi> coming in to help;&#x2014;winded up by a big walk with Nero thro&#x2019; the streets, having spoken to nobody.

<p>The Novel and also six or seven &#x201C;perfect sheets&#x201C; will wait for you at sunny Bank: Novel is good for little I doubt,&#x2014;dedicated to <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> I saw in <hi rend="italic">the Examiner,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> drove me into glancing at it again;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Orlando Williams Wight (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">88</date>), <hi rend="italic">Quinland, or, Varieties in American Life,</hi> 2 vols.

I dedicate it respectfully to you, because I recognise in you a man profoundly sincere, and in earnest&#x2014;a precious example not only for our age, but also for many ages yet to come&#x201C; (1:v). Wight visited Europe in <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, and wrote on philosophical and literary subjects. The hero of his novel is &#x201C;a man who has endured many trials, in order to devote himself to a life of noble self-culture and self-discipline&#x201C; (2:280). Echoing one of TC&#x2019;s favorite passages from Kant in the final chapter, Quinland embraces the necessity of duty and renunciation: &#x201C;Contemplation of the starry heavens above us, and the moral law within us, alone could move the calm mind of the great Kant to eloquence&#x201C; (2:340).</note>&#x2014;but it may amuse the old Ladies and you better than the average of Novels.

<p>Whether the spirit move me or not; I must write today in my own interest. A letter will be going from you to Sunny Bank else, before I am there to receive it&#x2014;&#x201C;and then I should be <hi rend="italic">vaixed.</hi>&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;This was a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> foolish old woman&#x2019;s way of pronouncing <hi rend="italic">vexed</hi>&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s later note, inserted above the line on MS).</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-33-41" n="33:41"/>My purpose to go there on Saturday raised, when it came to be known, a quite unexpected hullibulloo; and tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">persuadibility</hi> is not my besetting weakness, I consented &#x201C;eventually&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Craik&#x2019;s pedantic word&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s later note above &#x201C;eventually&#x201C;).</note> to stay till this day week. Now that their hearts seem turned to me with the affection of Father&#x2019;s Sisters; I feel to owe them a sort of obedience(!) as well as affection, as such, and could not persevere in doing what they were going to be seriously offended at, as well as grieved.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Three weeks at Sunny Bank already!&#x2014;a fortnight at Auchtertool!&#x2014;and only a week with the nearest relations I had on earth! &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201C;&#x2014; And the only urgent reason for hurrying away I had to give could not in politeness be given! viz: the <hi rend="italic">indegestion of sermons</hi> to be suffered during the night of Sunday! So I just made up my mind to it; the easier done that I sleep pretty well here in general, and indeed &#x201C;Ise <hi rend="italic">proud</hi> to say Ise some better.&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Variant of coterie speech, &#x201C;ashamed to say I&#x2019;se no better&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560918-JWC-TC-01"><sic>31:229</sic><corr>JWC to TC [<date when="1856-09-18">18 Sept. 1856</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> I take my plain regular meals with a certain heartiness&#x2014;feel less <hi rend="italic">fluttery</hi> and <hi rend="italic">haggard</hi>&#x2014;if not much better at <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> yet. And my Aunts insist I <hi rend="italic">look</hi> better. There was need!</p>
<p>I made out my call on little M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Samuel<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Dr</hi> S<hi rend="italic">l</hi> &#x26;c&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s later note on MS above &#x201C;Samuel&#x201C;).</note> Brown. I expected to find a sorrowful looking young woman in a widows cap, who would be pleased to see me, but probably agitated; the pleasure at seeing me was the only thing I found of all I was expecting! a young woman with rosy cheeks, and cheery looks, a bare head, with smart little knot at the back of it, tripped in, and thanked me for coming with a&#x2014;serenity!&#x2014;gaiety almost!&#x2014;that&#x2014;took away my breath! I, who cared nothing about her poor husband, could hardly keep back tears to see how&#x2014;the waters had closed over him! There was Woolners first medallion of <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> handsomely framed hanging on the wall opposite me. And she talked of &#x201C;the imme[n]se<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> debt of gratitude M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Brown owed you&#x201C; and of &#x201C;what a pleasure it must be to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle to think of the kindness he had shown to so many young men.&#x201C;&#x2014;never a tremor in her voice or a shadow on her face! And yet she seemed a good, honest little body; only with the thickest of skins! &#x201C;Seven years, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">to be always beside</hi> such suffering!&#x201C; I could hardly help saying &#x201C;yes! and seven years to <hi rend="italic">endure</hi> such suffering&#x201C;!</p>
  <p>Yesterday I went into Edin in the omnibus, and sought out Nichol&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC noted later above &#x201C;Nichol&#x2019;s&#x201C;: &#x201C;her mathemat<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Teacher&#x201C;; Walter Nichol (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), 2 Queen St., taught at Edinburgh High School (see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 215).</note> address in the Directory, and went after him. He lives in a top flat in Queen Street. John Stodart whom I met (as usual) walked to the house with me (a <pb id="pg-33-42" n="33:42"/>few yards) and climbed the stairs to ask if he were in, before I gave myself the trouble to go up. Nichol had opened the door to him himself, and John stupidly told him who wanted him. But there would have been no charming <hi rend="italic">scene,</hi> even if he hadn&#x2019;t. Poor old Nichol is past taking any part in anything <hi rend="italic">emotional.</hi> He is grown thin, and wears a little scratch wig, and the twinkling smile which used to constitute the expression of his face had left it utterly. &#x201C;Well!&#x201C; he said surveying me calmly &#x201C;I cant say I should ever have recognised you.&#x201C; I might have have<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> said ditto to the remark, but was too polite. John Stodart went off. I ascended with the old man to his clean cold intensely bachelor looking diningroom where we sat down side by side on a hard black sofa&#x2014; He asked me all the usual questions&#x2014;in a cold, rather low tone, and didn&#x2019;t seem to care the least in the world about my answers, or any <hi rend="italic">liveliness</hi> I could bring to bear on him. At last he informed me (and it was a sort of relief to my <hi rend="italic">feelings</hi>) that he was &#x201C;rather deaf&#x201C;&#x2014;in fact almost <hi rend="italic">entirely</hi> deaf, I suspect. He had retired from teaching last year&#x2014;and is now living there &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">ohne Amt</hi> [without a job]<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote above the line: &#x201C;&#x2018;blos von Geld&#x2019; [without money] (See Jean Paul <hi rend="italic">Schmelzle</hi>).&#x201C; For TC&#x2019;s trans., see <hi rend="italic">Army-Chaplain Schmelzle&#x2019;s Journey to Fl&#xe6;tz</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 22:131&#x2013;92).</note> he repeated several times, in his poor toneless old voice, that he took my visit very kind, and he offered me a glass of wine, but didn&#x2019;t seem sorry I declined, I came away very dreary. A life of monotonous toil&#x2014;to earn money enough for retiring upon when one is deaf and dried up and can&#x2019;t get any good of it.</p>

<p>Well, poor wandering little Soul, if you can stand the five sermons and the no-dinner&#x2014; But that latter clause I decidedly object to; and bid you arrange to <hi rend="italic">dine with Betty</hi> that day (you have cunning enough to contrive it); in some way you absolutely must have some natural living, and see that one way or other you do manage it!&#x2014; No other evil consequence has followed your change of plan, except it be this very slight one: The American Novel<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Quinland;</hi> see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570819-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1857-08-19">19 Aug.</date></ref></note> and 7 or 6 sheets are, in all probability, <hi rend="italic">today</hi> at Haddington waiting you. Post-Office has a right to keep such things lying one day; to guard ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> such possibility of your coming <hi rend="italic">un</hi>welcomed to Sunnybank tomorrow, I took time by the forelock,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> &#x26; here we are! The Novel will fairly keep; and the sheets too,&#x2014;however if you want these at once, it is best telling one of your old Ladies to <pb id="pg-33-44" n="33:44"/><hi rend="italic">draw</hi> the string of the Parcel; between the two <hi rend="italic">volumes</hi> they will find the sheets lying: these with a string tied round them and an Address will come for 2 pence;&#x2014;only they are not to be <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> this time, being &#x201C;perfect copy&#x201C;; so take care of them when they do arrive.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">two</hi> stamps on last Note were of Tom Wilson&#x2019;s doing:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Grace Welsh&#x2019;s comment, reported in <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570820-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-08-20">20 Aug.]</date></ref>.</note> I admonished him three times that <hi rend="italic">till</hi> he got to Sloane square he must forbear, <hi rend="italic">five</hi> p.m. being come; but that <hi rend="italic">at</hi> Sloane square or anywhere farther on&#x2014; Well, he walked away to Tait&#x2019;s with the Letter safe in <hi rend="italic">his pocket;</hi> and there they had to put on the second stamp.&#x2014; He is off to Weimar today; Tait <hi rend="italic">tones</hi> one other day here; then on Sunday goes off for Manchester &#x201C;Art treasures&#x201C;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Manchester Exhibition of the Art Treasures of the United Kingdom, <date when="1857-05-05">5 May</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-10-24">24 Oct. 1857</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> had described it, <date when="1857-05-09">9 May</date>: &#x201C;[T]he visitor begins with a study of Byzantine art &#x2026; and then advances steadily along a line of works by Cimabue, Giotto, Taddeo Gaddi, Angelico da Fiesole, Fra Filippo Lippi and Masaccio to Perugino, Leonardo da Vinci, and the age of Michael Angelo and Raffaelle. &#x2026; No famous painter is left unrepresented.&#x201C; The exhibition also included contemporary English and continental paintings, as well as a large collection of armor, ceramics, sculpture, and watercolors; it had attracted over 1,300,000 visitors by its close.</note> for Scotland;&#x2014;and you will find the <hi rend="italic">Picture</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior.</hi></note> wonderfully far off <hi rend="italic">finis</hi> still at your return, if that were much a sorrow to your hard heart! Such a feat of Painting I did not see before.</p>
<p>There are two more sheets this morning, and others will wait the <hi rend="italic">return</hi> of Goodykin,&#x2014;I wish we saw it: tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">don&#x2019;t</hi> hurry if you are getting the least benefit; it is too good news to hear you are perceptibly stronger!

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Your message from the Seaside<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Hythe.</note> came duly; I am glad to think of you sauntering about in the fresh saltwater breezes, in so desirable a solitude, till you get the Town dust blown out of you all.

TC probably means the historian G. A. H. Stenzel (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>).</note> Work: you will get me a real bit of help from it if you can hunt them up into any definite result,&#x2014;that is to say, find that all or any of them are both attainable &#x26; worth attaining.

<p><salute>My dear Jean&#x2014;</salute>Thanks a thousand for your kind invitation. Certainly if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be <hi rend="italic">persuaded</hi> into changing my mind, and doing what I had settled not to do, you would have persuaded me, by the warmth and urgency of your words. But I am, as you can hardly need to be told, &#x201C;vera obstinate in my own way!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; &#x201C;Cumberland man&#x2019;s account of the Scotch&#x201C; (note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:170).</note>&#x2014;might challenge the world, I think, to produce an instance of my ever doing a thing I had once positively refused to do! And, my Dear, I positively refused to go to Dumfriesshire this season, weeks ago. You may be sure it was not from want of asking that I have not been to Thornhill and am not meaning to go. &#x2026; Thornhill where I had never been till last year since my Mother&#x2019;s death,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>.</note> and then for only a few days, still looks too emotional by far for weak nerves and worn-out spirits. If I got strong and courageous and all that at Sunny Bank, I might <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> go home by Thornhill, I thought; I would wait and see. So I waited and saw&#x2014;that it was &#x201C;no go.&#x201C; Not that I am not stronger since I left London. For the first week or two, I improved very decidedly; and tho&#x2019; I have fallen back since, especially during my fortnight at Auchtertool <pb id="pg-33-47" n="33:47"/>(where I couldn&#x2019;t avoid going, being so near), still I have not fallen back to the London point of inability; and hope that my travels in search of health won&#x2019;t be trouble and money wasted after all.</p>
<p>But I am far from feeling up to any superfluous knocking about, or superfluous excitement; am, as dear Betty says, &#x201C;ower wake [too weak] for <hi rend="italic">toiling</hi> myself.&#x201C; So I wrote to Mrs. Russell a fortnight ago, that I had quite decided to go back to London the way I came.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Rest of the Letter a-wanting&#x201C;</hi> (A.

<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> What a magnificent Book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi> &#x201C;<date when="1857-08-24">1857 (Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 24</date>; <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> (books? 1 &#x26; 2) / <hi rend="italic">read</hi> / <hi rend="italic">how</hi> gratifying to me <hi rend="italic">then!</hi>&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note on envelope). &#x201C;This is the last (and perhaps the first, and pretty much the one) bit of pure sunshine that visited my dark and lonesome, and in the end quite dismal and inexpressible, enterprise of Frederick; the rest was all darkness, solitude; air leaden coloured, frozen rain, sound of subterranean torrents, like Balder&#x2019;s ride to the Death Kingdom, &#x2018;needing,&#x2019; as I often said, the obstinacy of ten mules for ten or thirteen years at that time of life. Except a small patch of writing by Emerson, this is the only bit of human criticism in which, across the general exaggeration, I could discover real lineaments of the thing. Very memorable was this of her to me, and will for ever be. How memorable are all these letters of <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>, and my silent moods (deep sorrow and toil, tinted with gratitude and hope) in those summer months!&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is going to be!

<p><pb id="pg-33-48" n="33:48"/>It was <hi rend="italic">the sheets</hi> that hindered me from writing yesterday; tho&#x2019; I doubt if a letter posted at Morningside (the Scotch <hi rend="italic">Campo Santo</hi> [cemetery] yesterday (Sunday) would have reached you sooner than if posted today. Certainly it is a Devil of a place for keeping the Sunday, this! Such Preaching, and Fasting, and &#x201C;Tooting<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s note on MS: &#x201C;touting&#x2014;(trumpeting or loud-reciting).&#x201C;</note> and Praying&#x201C; as I was never before concerned in! But one never knows whence <hi rend="italic">deliverance</hi> is to come any more than <hi rend="italic">misfortune!</hi> I was cut out of all, or nearly all my difficulties yesterday&#x2014;by the simple provedential means of&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">bowel complaint!</hi> It was reason enough for staying away from Church; excuse enough for declining to be read to; and the loss of my dinner was entirely made up for, by the loss of my appetite! Nothing could have happened more opportunely! Left at home with Pen (the cat) when they had gone every one to their <hi rend="italic">different</hi> &#x201C;Places of Worship&#x201C;; I opened my desk to write you a letter. But I would just take a look at <hi rend="italic">the sheets</hi> first. (Miss Jess had put a second cover on the parcel, and forwarded it by railway on Saturday night; and I had not been able to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> then, by the <hi rend="italic">gass</hi> light, which dazzles my eyes. It is one of the little peculiarities of this house that there isn&#x2019;t a <hi rend="italic">candle</hi> allowed in it of any sort, wax, dip, moulded or composite!) Well I took up the sheets, and read &#x2018;here a little and there a little,&#x2019; and then I began at the beginning, and never could stop till I had read to the end, and pretty well learnt it by heart. I was still reading when Church came out, and so my letter got nipt in the bud.

<p>Well, you are an excell<hi rend="italic">t encouraging</hi> Goody; that is certain! I had some tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> yesterday, amid my disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> when nothing came, that these &#x201C;Sheets&#x201C; might be concerned in it somehow; and so it proves this morning, when your Letter comes to season breakfast for me. An ever-<hi rend="italic">encouraging</hi> Goody; it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be worth while to write Books, if mankind w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> read them as you do. Truly it is a merit I have all along experienced at your bits of hands; and I never forget it, nor will. All the same to you: from the first discovery of me you have predicted good in a confid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> manner: all the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> whether the world were singing chorus, or no part of the world dreaming of such a thing, but of much the reverse. &#x201C;No, by Allah,&#x201C; I do not forget it! (I have gone out, quietly put away a yellow scoundrel,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Organ grinder; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530208-TC-JCA-01"><sic>28:38</sic><corr>TC-JCA, <date when="1853-02-08">8 Feb. 1853</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530708-TC-JWC-01"><sic>185</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1853-07-08">8 July</date></corr></ref>.</note> and now I resume)&#x2014; The fact is, that part of the Book is better than what follows. We must take the evil and the good. Habitually my feeling is, that the Book <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be a botch and a wreck: but also that I must and shall get done with it. If I can stand fiercely to the thing for about a year more, we shall see! And actually the Printing goes on apace; and every week (not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> travail,&#x2014;last Saturday and Sunday <hi rend="italic">all</hi> spent over sheets for instance!)

<p>The day is roasting-hot again; yet beautifully clear, a faint <hi rend="italic">west</hi>-wind rippling in some of the tree tops.

<salute>Dear Little Being,</salute>
<p>I know I shall get a Letter tomorrow, and so am patient under <hi rend="italic">none</hi> today, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed I did not expect, knowing what you had to do, in the flurry of railway-trains &#x26;c &#x26;c. This is a word to keep your little fancy easy over the Sunday. &#x201C;Home&#x201C; now will soon be the word! I think every time I hear that Clock strike downstairs: &#x201C;You will not need above <hi rend="italic">another</hi> winding, my good fellow!&#x201C; But do not hurry either: surely if you are getting the least benefit, take it all with you. I have heard nothing of <hi rend="italic">sea-bathing</hi> farther; did you try it at all from Morningside? I think not. Are you to give it up then; or is there not still some chance for you. Me it always used to benefit quite sensibly and at once; but you, I think, were more precarious. <hi rend="italic">Cold,</hi> you know, is the thing to be guarded against.&#x2014; Most certainly you were wise to leave the &#x201C;Art-<pb id="pg-33-55" n="33:55"/>treasures&#x201C; resting on their own basis. I feel as if I could not go across the street to look at them, with such a sorrowful <hi rend="italic">canaillery</hi> all barking about them at one&#x2019;s right and left. A fatallish Prince-Consort, this of ours, driven into the &#x201C;Art&#x201C; line for a career;&#x2014;and thinking e.g. Marochetti an Artist!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlo Marochetti (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>; <ref target="volume-33/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18085"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), sculptor; his statue of Richard the Lionheart had caused a sensation at the <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date> Great Exhibition; his statue of Victoria in Glasgow, sculpted <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>, was described as &#x201C;the finest that has yet been produced&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News,</hi> <date when="1854-09-16">16 Sept. 1854</date>, 249).</note>&#x2014;leave all that to its own bad fate.&#x2014; &#x2014; And observe, none of your &#x201C;cheap trains&#x201C; again!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in her journey N with the Craiks; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570708-JWC-TC-01"><sic>32:173&#x2013;74</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-07-08">8 July</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> Take the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> train that can be had for money or love; and come home to me, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> poisoned by foul air and annoyances.

But I suppose you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have no chance to sleep on the intervening night:&#x2014;so it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be worse, not better.</p>
<p>The weather today has grown suddenly quite <hi rend="italic">coldish;</hi> grey, gusty east-wind (after such a fiery calm as we had), and rain evidently copious and not far off. I tried down below this morning but any papers went at such a dancing rate, I fled in, especially when the sun disappeared. I am in a dreadful <hi rend="italic">ashpit</hi> of Prussian genealogies &#x26;c; all the <hi rend="italic">imps</hi> in Chaos giggling at me, &#x201C;Can you pull that straight, my man? And you think it <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> pulling straight?&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">New</hi> Proofs too wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I dare not look at (till once this thing be done, which refers to them):&#x2014;heigho! I had got into bad sleep,&#x2014;two nights of it; when I discovered this morning that, in <hi rend="italic">fact,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">potatoes,</hi> tho&#x2019; mealy were not ripe!

Gode<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was cheerful good company; I myself stupid as an owl (owing recently to the <hi rend="italic">potatoes,</hi> tho&#x2019; I ate only 2): we saw a dismal Cremorne balloon take the ground near Wandsworth;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1857-08-22">22 Aug.</date>, advertised a balloon ascent by Stephen Chambers, R.N., <date when="1857-08-27">27 Aug.</date>, from the Royal Gardens, Cremorne, in Chelsea, tickets 1 shilling.

Such complete misunderstanding exists between the little Hadd: cross train and all other trains; that one may lay one&#x2019;s account with having to wait always three quarters of an hour at the least. Then the waiting room is &#x201C;too stuffy <hi rend="italic">for anything</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014;and the seated structure outside expressly contrived for catching cold in; so that one is fain to hang about on one&#x2019;s legs; in space!

Even in the midst of these raptures my eye sought and discovered your letter on the usual table&#x2014;but I refrained from opening it (paragon of politeness that I was!) till dinner was over; for which I had already kept them waiting an hour.</p>
<p>They think me <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> much better.

And it was so pleasant talking about &#x201C;dear old Long Ago&#x201C; with those who I <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> (for the first time perhaps) had interests in common with me in it! It was better <hi rend="italic">so,</hi> surely I thought after our affectionate parting yesterday; far better so, than if I had <hi rend="italic">gone to law</hi> with them about that fraction of my Grandfather&#x2019;s property I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have disputed; and even gained it! and put heart-burnings and resentment between my own Fathers sisters and me for evermore!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;In final settlement of heritage into equal parts, John Welsh, senior, totally omitted her (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> her father, who was eldest, and had been the benefactor and stay of all the family), of which I remember she wrote at the time to me, nobly sorrowful&#x2014;not ignobly then or ever, in that case or in any.&#x2014;T.

I had reason to believe I was taking &#x2018;<hi rend="small-caps">a cold</hi>&#x2019; (in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> emphatic sense of the word!) and what was to become of me? how was I to get home? Worse and worse I grew all the <pb id="pg-33-58" n="33:58"/>evening, my skin burning and violent pains in my face and back! By a decided inspiration of Nature, I asked Miss Jess to give me a <hi rend="italic">stiff</hi> little tumbler of Hollands Toddy!!!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dutch gin with hot water and sugar.</note> I drank it off, and retired to bed, while the <hi rend="italic">intoxication</hi> lasted; fell into the soundest, longest sleep I had had for some years! and got up next morning as well as ever!</p>
<p>But how I wish now, I had my long journey safely over! If I could only like &#x201C;the Princess of China&#x201C; (in the Arabian Nights) be carried thro the air, asleep in my bed, and set down on the roof of my own house!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Badoura, princess of China, is taken from her bed and transported by genies to and from the bed of Prince Camaralzaman while still asleep: &#x201C;The Story of Prince Camaralzaman and the Princess Badoura,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights&#x2019; Entertainments.</hi></note> I fear far more the journey back than I did the journey hither. I seemed <hi rend="italic">then</hi> to have nothing to lose&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">now,</hi> I am so desirous, (God knows, for your sake as well as for my own) to take back my little gains of strength, and sleep, and cheerfulness unbroken in upon by any exposure or fatigue. Oh Dear! that one should ever live to have to bother so much about <hi rend="italic">oneself!</hi> I have been considering about making two days of the journey, and would do it, if I could find a travelling companion, or had any <hi rend="italic">known</hi> house to put up at in the road. But all alone in a Railway Hotel! no amount of <hi rend="italic">Hollands,</hi> I fancy, could put me to sleep in that circumstance!</p>
<p>Well&#x2014; no more about it just now, for I haven&#x2019;t yet fixed my day! haven&#x2019;t been <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> speaking of it! It takes more courage than I have always at hand now a days, to answer the pleadings of these dear old old women with; &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">I must</hi>&#x2019; &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">I will</hi>&#x2019;!</p>
<p>Meanwhile I am reading <hi rend="italic">the sheets</hi> to them&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">they</hi> most likely will not live to see the finished Book&#x2014; You never saw more <hi rend="italic">ardent</hi> listeners! My Godmother with her head bent forward, hearkening with her blind eyes as well as her ears, might sit for a picture of <hi rend="italic">Attention!</hi> And every now and then one or other asks some question, or makes some remark that shows how <hi rend="italic">intelligently</hi> they listen Miss Jess said one good thing, &#x201C;To look merely to the <hi rend="italic">wording,</hi> it is so <hi rend="italic">brief</hi> so <hi rend="italic">concise,</hi> that one would expect some obscurity in the narrative or at least that it would need a great effort of attention to understand it; instead of which the meaning is as clear as glass.&#x201C; and Miss Donaldson said&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I see more than ever in this, my Dear, what I have always seen in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s Books; and what I think distinguishs him from all the Writers of the present day; a great love of Truth&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">what is more</hi> (observe the fine discrimination!) <hi rend="italic">a perfect detestation of Lies!</hi>&#x201C;</p>
<p>I was afraid having to read in a voice so high pitched, my reading would not do justice to the thing. but&#x2014;Miss Donaldson asked me last night. &#x201C;My Dear, does M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle read&#x2014;what he writes to you bit by bit&#x201C;? &#x201C;Oh dear no!&#x2014;he <pb id="pg-33-59" n="33:59"/>does not like reading aloud.&#x201C; &#x201C;Then I suppose you read it often over to yourself? For I was noticing that in reading those sheets, you did it so&#x2014;so&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">natural like;</hi> just as if it was coming out of your <hi rend="italic">own</hi> head!&#x201C;</p>
<p>You may well say what a letter of Lord Ashburtons! Curious! that man seems in a general way so sweet-natured; and yet the only sentiment I ever see him express in a <hi rend="italic">real human</hi> way is <hi rend="italic">anger!</hi> Several times, for moments, I have seen him really, <hi rend="italic">humanly</hi> angry. (tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">shriekily</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hysterically</hi> enough) but all the rest of his sentiments (his grief included) seem no more <hi rend="italic">really</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">his</hi> than the sentiments of Macbeth are William Macready&#x2019;s indeed not so much! He plays the part of <hi rend="italic">his own Life</hi> like a <hi rend="italic">third rate</hi> actor who cant identify himself for a moment with the feelings he has got to express&#x2014;unless you make him <hi rend="italic">angry!</hi></p>
<p>Poor little M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Royston!&#x2014; I am sure Chancellor&#x2019;s Dunghill<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From George Chancellor&#x2019;s stables.</note> is concerned in this!

<p>Haddington is not a handy place for posts; that is one fault of it. I got no Letter all Saturday, and had given it up, which rather grieved me in the <pb id="pg-33-60" n="33:60"/>afternoon; but there was still hope of 6 p.m., with wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> to go riding. Nothing still! And so after giving it up altogether, <hi rend="italic">something</hi> came at eight.&#x2014; Today (near 4 p.m. now) has been barren too: but it is still possible? On the whole I pronounce that R<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Hill<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rowland Hill; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570901-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1857-09-01">1 Sept.</date></ref></note> very probably a charlatan (dancing it on the tight-rope before an enlightened long-eared Public and <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Newspaper);&#x2014;very probably a charlatan, and certainly a great nuisance as matters are,&#x2014;till you get home, that is to say. I have been driven in by stress of weath[er]:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> a heavy shower began sputtering, has now ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> fallen; I bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in my goods, table, desk &#x26;c with a big umbrella screening; and am now seated <hi rend="italic">close</hi> before the sideboard, Screen breaking the draught from the front windows. I was upstairs first of all for an hour and half, dealing with rubbish; but it was like to choke me, so close and sultry, till I fled out of doors. I have had a terrible bout with <hi rend="italic">Proofs</hi> and confusions since Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last all the way; I started yesterday in a desperate humour (having reinforced myself by an hour-and-halfs walk the night before): I worked all day,&#x2014;obliged to come down at last, tho&#x2019; it was very windy;&#x2014;refused to ride, dine or stir till I got <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> the horror; and did actually manage it, dinner and all, before sunset. Immense walk with Nero then, in the cool ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> which was very pleasant, very beneficial in the headache way. Tea at home,&#x2014;made by myself <hi rend="italic">down stairs</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 10, in the absence of Anne (as had been bargained):&#x2014;it was really a <hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi> ploy. But the fact is, I am out of sorts for days past;&#x2014;and know what is the matter with me, and will take it in hand this very day.</p>
<p>Lady Sand<hi rend="italic">h</hi> &#x26; Miss Raikes<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly of 22 Curzon St., Mayfair; not further identified.</note> came in on me yesterday: Lady S. is probably writing today, for she took your address.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your two Notes; any word with that <hi rend="italic">date</hi> to it brings a strangely interesting scene before me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is referring to the place in Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s dateline, rather than date (for the same usage, cf. <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570915-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1857-09-15">15 Sept.</date>]</ref>), and thinking about his visit to Kinlochluichart to stay with the Ashburtons, <date when="1857-00-10">10</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-09-29">29 Sept. 1856</date>; see vol. 31.</note> I calculate never to see it with eyes again; but to the mind I think it will long be visible little less distinctly than if I stood in the midst of it.&#x2014; I hope you will drive away the gout into remote corners not to return easily; that will be one excellent effect of roaming on those mountains; in other respects I could more willingly fancy you nearer home. As I hope you will be before long.</p>
<p>London is very sultry, close, and altogether deserted by fashionable mankind. The other day my ride led me thro&#x2019; streets, St James&#x2019;s, past your House; I did not see one figure definable reasonably as a gentleman; few in clean clothes, indeed <hi rend="italic">few</hi> of any description. As I cross the Park there are still about 10 or 15 male and female persons ambling or cantering in Rotten Row,&#x2014;an extremely melancholy business for them, I should think, the <hi rend="italic">Row</hi> admitting not a breath of wind into it; no comfort in it for either horse or man.&#x2014; I am, as I was &#x26; shall be, overwhelmed with Printers&#x2019; devils and their adjuncts; I ride as one swallows <hi rend="italic">black-draught;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Purgative medicine of senna and magnesia.</note> and have no hope left but the humble one of getting this intolerable burden tumbled off if I can hold out for a twelvemonth more. My Wife is as it were on the way homewards,&#x2014;at Haddington again, 16 miles of the road accomplished;&#x2014;rather better she herself admits, but still very feeble, and shuddering at the long journey,&#x2014;with nothing but delirious machinery round one, and no breathing except of foul air! I hope to see her again, on some tolerable terms, within a week or so. Lady Sandwich called last Sunday; I had not seen her since the night I was at Addiscomb:&#x2014; I fancied to myself she was looking very well this last time after her country visits. I promised to go and dine some day, &#x201C;to drive Fritz out of my head,&#x201C; as the ostensible object was. She has wonderful spirit,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; a transient cloud comes over her at times, and the old eyes fill with tears.</p>
<p>The Indian Affairs hang like a millstone on me,&#x2014;if I did not shake them off altogether: what have I to do with them? It seems to me neither greased Cartridges,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the cartridges greased with cow and pig fat, see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570713-TC-JWC-01"><sic>32:182&#x2013;83</sic><corr>TC to JWC, [<date when="1857-07-13">13 July</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> nor Col<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Wheeler,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Hugh Massy Wheeler (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>; <ref target="volume-33/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29186"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); maj. gen., Indian Army, in command at Cawnpore, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; murdered in the massacre at Satichaura Ghat on the Ganges, <date when="1857-06-27">27 June</date>.</note> nor our procedures in Oude,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >British annexation of Oude, NW India, and the appropriation of its revenue in <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date> provoked criticism in Parliament and widespread resentment in India. Helen Mackenzie wrote: &#x201C;Not only was the Bengal army almost entirely recruited from Oudh, but the majority of our native civil officials were drawn from thence. No wonder then that annexation, followed as it was by wholesale disturbance of the actual tenure of property, should have resulted in mutiny and insurrection&#x201C; (Helen Mackenzie, <hi rend="italic">Storms and Sunshine of a Soldier&#x2019;s Life</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>] 2:204).</note> nor any other <pb id="pg-33-63" n="33:63"/>mysterious Secondary cause is worth talking of in the presence of a most clear and patent <hi rend="italic">primary cause,</hi> an Army with Officers of the Imaginary sort!

<p>I am better today, dear Goody of my heart, and have got a piece of work done; I hope you do not mind transient grumblings, knowing the nature of the beast by this time. &#x201C;Yellow scoundrels,&#x201C; tho&#x2019; I speak of them so often, really are not troublesome to speak of; very many days they do not come at all, and if I were always tolerably <hi rend="italic">well,</hi> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> care little about them.

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> was here when I got in from riding; and so nice, cheery and good a Letter to read over one&#x2019;s tea,&#x2014;with Nero waiting for the <hi rend="italic">grounds</hi> and powder of crumbs! Thank you, good little Being;&#x2014;and beware, I entreat you, of exposures, colds, and don&#x2019;t come home &#x201C;damaged&#x201C; again. I have been thinking a good deal about your journey, and how it c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be divided. <hi rend="italic">Unless</hi> you <pb id="pg-33-64" n="33:64"/>can get some companion and take a hotel for lodging, which I hardly hope,&#x2014;there is no method visible to me but this one: To go fairly back to Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and start there by the Caledonian and &#x201C;North-<hi rend="italic">Western</hi>&#x201C; route, as we call it here. That really can be done. The difference of distance from London to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is only a few miles; and I believe the N.

<p>I got the sheets safe yesterday afternoon&#x2014; It was more than I hoped for&#x2014; But they are not read yet! The carriage was coming round to take Eliza and me a drive before tea&#x2014;(the fore noon having been too rainy for anything) and after tea is the time I sit talking to Miss Donaldson&#x2014;or reading to her&#x2014;I durst not undertake to read <hi rend="italic">so aloud</hi> the sheets I wasn&#x2019;t familiar with&#x2014; Then in my own room before going to bed I <hi rend="italic">wouldn&#x2019;t</hi> read them for fear of spoiling my sleep&#x2014;much came of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> precaution!&#x2014; now, it is still quite early morning, but I wished to put a few lines off my hands first thing&#x2014;to insure you against a disappointment tomorrow&#x2014; Along with the sheets yesterday came a disagreeable letter from Geraldine&#x2014; All her letters since I have been away have been &#x201C;most disagreeable&#x201C; I think she is growing into what is called &#x201C;an illnatured old maid,&#x201C; only that, so long as M Mantel<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, for &#x201C;Mr&#x201C; and Walter Mantell.</note> is to the fore, she has no idea of old maidhood! In her last she gives me to understand that Ann would much prefer me to stay away!&#x2014; In fact all along she has been impressing on me in sly terms, that my absence was felt to be good company at Cheyne Row&#x2014;and that if I ever come back, it would be at the risk of spoiling every bodys good humour!!</p>
<p>Never the less, I may be looked for on Wednesday night if you hear nothing to the contrary&#x2014; In my study of <hi rend="italic">Brydone</hi> last night; I perceived or believe to have perceived that could I get to Dunbar by 10 on Wednesday morning I should be picked up by the Day-Express Train! The difficulty was to get to Dunbar&#x2014; And now Miss Jess tells me I can have the carriage at any hour of the morning I like, to take me all that distance! How much more use is got out of comparatively poor peoples carriages than rich peoples!&#x2014; &#x201C;It would be a great advantage&#x201C; to escape a <hi rend="italic">night</hi> on the road either in an Inn or in a Train&#x2014; I might have a billet in a private house at Dunbar but that would be just as worrying as a bed at an Inn paid with one&#x2019;s own money! I must to the Station here, and ask questions &#x2014; &#x2014; In my next you will have the final conclusion No more at present for &#x201C;my head&#x2019;s like a mall and my stomach like a barn bannock&#x201C;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;[P]oor Betty Smail of <hi rend="italic">Scotsbrig&#x2019;s</hi> express<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note on MS); i.e., with a head like tangled string and a stomach like unleavened bread made with oatmeal.</note></p>

<p>Only half a word today, my dear little Jeannie; lest there should not be time for writing again before you&#x2014;come! I wish to Heaven we saw you here and safe! By Heaven&#x2019;s favour that will be,&#x2014;day after tomorrow, if all hold good.</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> Letter did not come till <hi rend="italic">this morning:</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Monday; for the &#x201C;Friday letter,&#x201C; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570904-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-09-04">4 Sept.</date>].</ref></note> such irregularities are intolerable;&#x2014;however, we are now near thro&#x2019; it for the present. I tried to keep my imagin<hi rend="italic">n</hi> quiet:&#x2014;indeed I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have had much comfort <hi rend="italic">there</hi> had I got the Letter. Poor little Life-Friendkin; sitting there awake to the finger-ends, studying railway-trains instead of sleeping, in the dead of night! Alas, I cannot help thee: I know that dismal mood of studying railways, in the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> state one is in. Nevertheless pick up heart: it is not so bad as it looks, when actually going on;&#x2014;and it lasts only for a day. <hi rend="italic">Then</hi> there will be joy in Nero and the Canaries, and in creatures more important here; and there will be your own room, quiet house all clean, and my poor useless <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> (true, whether you believe it as you should or not) for a place of shelter to poor Goodykin! That is fact, however the trains go; and you must look to that, and <hi rend="italic">thole</hi> (<hi rend="italic">dulden</hi>)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >German for Scots &#x201C;thole,&#x201C; &#x201C;to endure.&#x201C;</note> by the road and before it.&#x2014; &#x2014; No Letter but the Friday one has come today (4&#xBD; p.m); but one still may: tonight <hi rend="italic">or tomorrow</hi> I expect one with confidence; to say what train, and when and at what station I am to catch you up, and triumphantly carry you home again!</p>
<p>All is right enough here;&#x2014;nothing gone awry, except my nerves from Lady S.&#x2019;s dinner,&#x2014;never been <hi rend="italic">right since;</hi> and today I am to <hi rend="italic">repeat</hi> the operat<hi rend="italic">n.</hi> Fool that I am:&#x2014;but it will be the <hi rend="italic">last time;</hi> and I will take all care I can this time. I subdued my Proofs yesterday; a horrid job again; Chorley took me out an hour&#x2019;s walk; then a ride, then at night the Beauty: &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">returned</hi> from the seaside,&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg had been in Hythe with his sister, Rosetta.</note> and as ugly as ever.</p>
<p>Today, and now, I am beneath the <hi rend="italic">awning</hi> again: hot <hi rend="italic">sun;</hi> but air <hi rend="italic">coldish</hi> &#x26; brisk. In my last smoke, about midnight, I much admire the Harvest Moon these three last nights.&#x2014; &#x2014; I am to ride today; L<hi rend="italic">y</hi> S.&#x2019;s groom to take my horse; <hi rend="italic">home,</hi> too, at 9&#xBD; p.m thro&#x2019; the Park:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hyde Park.</note>&#x2014;but lo, I am already <hi rend="italic">too late,</hi> and must close with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> another word!

<p>How long are you to be away?&#x2014; If you are coming back shortly as I hope, it will be no use going into particulars about anything.

<salute>Dear Strachey,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to hear of the pleasant event that has taken place in your family; and much obliged by your kindness in notifying it to me. I hope the little fellow will grow up to be a credit to his kindred and country,&#x2014;and perhaps be heard of to his advantage, in England and the East, as his ancestors have been!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their son, John, b. <date when="1857-09-05">5 Sept.</date>, also became an administrator in India.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-33-81" n="33:81"/>The East is not at all a pleasant place at present, since you left it; I have often thought how fatally soon your worst prognostications of it, that evening, have verified themselves!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Strachey recalled: &#x201C;In the spring of <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> &#x2026; my brother &#x2026; was spending an evening with the Carlyles, when there was much conversation about India. Although, at this time, no one foresaw the particular catastrophe which was near the horizon, there were certain mutterings of an approaching storm, and my brother had expressed in emphatic language his conviction of the utter rottenness of the native army&#x201C; (Strachey, &#x201C;Reminiscences&#x201C; 24).</note> I cannot bear to read those inhuman details in the Newspapers, nor do I love in the least the spirit in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the English People mainly have taken it up. To punish the Sepoys, and mince them all to pieces &#x26;c &#x26;c:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably referring to reports throughout <date when="1857-09-00">Sept.</date> of the brutal practice of executing convicted rebels and mutineers by strapping them to the muzzle of a gun or cannon and firing. <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News,</hi> <date when="1857-10-03">3 Oct.</date>, reported an army parade, 10 June, at which there were 12 hangings and 45 such executions.</note> it were far better if the English People thought of punishing themselves for the very great folly they have manifested there,&#x2014;and indeed I grieve to think, in nearly all departments of their affairs lately,&#x2014;whereby such results have become possible, had become inevitable. People only weary me assigning &#x201C;Causes&#x201C;;&#x2014;I seek, at present, no farther than the <hi rend="italic">uppermost</hi> cause: An Army commanded for 50 years by imaginary Captains;&#x2014;probably the most conspicuously portentous Entity the Sun can look down upon; and capable of fermenting into results of any required degree of hideousness, against a given (tho&#x2019; unknown) day. The English Army generally, in India and elsewhere, has to me in these late years (whilst I have been reading about real Armies) been a subject of endless wonder, deep and far from joyful. England thinks herself the &#x201C;wisest nation of the world&#x201C; quite as a settled truism, not worth asserting: England will, before long, become less conspicuously the most blockhead Nation in the world, or India will not be the last ill news she hears! In fact, I am grieved and miserable about these things;&#x2014;and have no resource but to banish them wholly out of my head, and to think of my own work while I have any.</p>
<p>My Wife came home, Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last, from a Two-months in Scotland, undertaken for health&#x2019;s sake,&#x2014;evidently not without some profit that way. I have been grinding along here, and shall be, without interval, for a period alarming to think of.&#x2014; Do not neglect us when you come to Town again.</p>

<p><salute>Oh Mary Mary!</salute> Does it ever enter your head to calculate how long it is since you received my last letter? What <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you doing, my Dear, that justifies you in your own eyes for not writing to <hi rend="italic">me?</hi> Dont you love me? and dont I love you&#x2014;as a sister? and are people, to love and be loved by, as plenty as blackberries; that nothing should be done with them but wishing them well, at a distance? If there were nothing else in it; have you no curiosity about my <hi rend="italic">how</hi> and <hi rend="italic">where?</hi></p>
<p>The date of this letter will show you <hi rend="italic">where</hi> I am; but I have a good mind not to tell you <hi rend="italic">how</hi> I am&#x2014;since you don&#x2019;t ask! Only this; I am home at Cheyne Row again, with my time more at my own disposal than when living in other people&#x2019;s houses; and if you expect to be &#x201C;well let alone&#x201C; in your silence; you will find yourself mistaken; for I will write you letter on the back of letter, till I shame you into being a better correspondent I repined a good deal at not seeing you, when within such a managable distance&#x2014; But if restricting myself to one part of the country deprived me of some pleasure; it spared me a good deal of a thing, I cannot take too little of at present viz: <hi rend="italic">emotion;</hi> and was best for the end I had in view&#x2014;to get back some strength before winter. Had my time in the country been spent as the year before, in hurrying from place to place, I shouldnt have come back as well as I am. I went no where but to my Cousins my Aunts and my dear old friends at Haddington&#x2014; I was only a fortnight at Auchtertool&#x2014;the bustle of dinner-parties and all that did not suit me&#x2014; With my aunts I staid also a fortnight and got on well there. They were as kind as possible, and could see what I needed, above all things not to be <hi rend="italic">fussed!</hi> Then I returned to Haddington for another fortnight on my way to London; coming home by Berwick and York; as I went. I had an old schoolfellow (a Man)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Dods, though it was Alexander Trotter who accompanied her on the journey.</note> to take care of me on the journey, and came to no harm. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C says I look much better and never ceases paying me compliments on my&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">appitite!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> <hi rend="italic">He</hi> seems to have got on better without me than my vanity led me to expect. Ann was very attentive to him, and I have no doubt would have liked me to take a great deal more &#x201C;fresh air&#x201C; than I thought enough. However, if she mourned in secret at having to abdicate the mistressship, she had the grace to put a good face on it, and received me very <hi rend="italic">affably!</hi></p>
<p>But Nero!&#x2014; I am shocked to have to confess that Nero was far from <pb id="pg-33-83" n="33:83"/>showing the enthusiasm &#x201C;England expected&#x201C; of him! He knew me quite well but took me very coolly indeed. Ann said he had &#x201C;just been sleeping&#x201C;&#x2014; Let us hope he was in a state of indigestion, in which dogs are not capable of being amiable any more than their Masters!</p>
<p>How are your servants going on? How do you sleep, poor Dear? How is your Husband God bless him? Tell me everything</p>

She was lively, beautiful, and interested in the arts, natural history, and evangelicalism; she had no substantial dowry. She had been in love with the historical writer and art collector William Stirling of Keir, later Stirling-Maxwell (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>; <ref target="volume-33/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26537"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480224-TC-WS-01"><sic>22:250</sic><corr>TC to WS, <date when="1848-02-24">24 Feb. 1848</date></corr></ref>), but he had never encouraged her. At this time she was being courted by the painter Sir Edwin Landseer (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>; <ref target="volume-33/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15984"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).

If he is really an intelligent studious man, might it not be an act of human munificence to give him a few books? Histories of Scotland, of the Church of Scotland, &#x26;c: &#xa3;10 or &#xa3;5 spent well on Books might be a great gift to him. I mention this, not knowing in the least what propriety or feasibility may be in it: a vague suggestion merely; knowing that if a good action of the kind <hi rend="italic">were</hi> open to you, few men would be <pb id="pg-33-84" n="33:84"/>thankfuller to do it.&#x2014; On the whole, I wish he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come and take <hi rend="italic">my</hi> winter here, and leave me his (<hi rend="italic">minus</hi> the preaching); wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> would be a wonderful exchange indeed, in respect to difference of wares!&#x2014;</p>

And alas we already <hi rend="italic">know</hi> a great deal more than we are likely to get done in that matter soon: I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say, To have a real Army in India (what my friend Fritz w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have called an Army), instead of the portentous Sham of an Army there has evidently been: this, it seems to me, is the Law and Prophets at present; all else entirely useless without this;&#x2014;and on the terms that there are, I foresee difficulties manifold (which I hope are not impossibilities) ahead of this. Nay a real Army for Great Britain itself, instead of the phantasmal one, consisting of brave mostly <hi rend="italic">drunken</hi> soldiers trained to do platoon exercise, and commanded by &#x201C;long-poles with cocked-hats on them&#x201C; (very <hi rend="italic">fearless</hi> long-poles, if you will): this also seems to me an interest terribly vital to Great Brit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> at present.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vernon Lushington wrote in a similar vein during the Crimean War: &#x201C;[T]he way in which we treat our soldiers and sailors is scandalous; and it would be well if the people of England could be brought to feel this. &#x2026; The wonder rather is, that there is so much virtue and manliness yet alive in our war professions&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">How Shall the Strong Man Use His Strength?</hi> [<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>] 95 and 97).</note> In fact, when I often think of it, What other Reality <hi rend="italic">except</hi> the Drill-Serjeant is there afoot in the Official world at present?

<p>Alas, I conceive very well how you seek distant enterprises; what reluctance you feel to front that big empty palace at The Grange, and take the sad floutings of the memories it will raise in you! Nevertheless, to look them in the face; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to flinch or fly; for, except in your own place, valiantly working at your own task, there is no refuge to be found in the world. Perhaps you would postpone it till you be hardened a little more? To this I can say nothing,&#x2014;except what doubtless you often say to yourself, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Hora fugit</hi> [the Hours fly past]: the Day is on the decline; the Night cometh wherein no man can work!&#x201C;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John 9:4.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; I have always had in my heard<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS for &#x201C;heart.&#x201C;</note> you were to do something great there, in the way of <hi rend="italic">Exemplary Schoolmastership</hi> (so let me term it); surely one of the things most of all wanted in this epoch of ours.

<p><name>T. Carlyle</name><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin recalled his difficulty in finding a map of Prussia before the reign of Frederick II: &#x201C;Neither from Carlyle&#x2019;s words, nor from any maps in his possession (all most excellent maps for modern purposes) could I at all make out what were the actual limits of Prussia when Frederick came to the throne. Nor could Carlyle himself help me in the matter. &#x2026; And at last I found, in a collection of old maps in the King&#x2019;s Library at the British Museum, the very map I wanted. It was a very rude affair. But there, plainly daubed in, was a rude outline of the old Prussian kingdom; and Carlyle&#x2019;s story about the matter became as clear as daylight. By this fortunate discovery, I was enabled to show the boundaries of Prussia, as they were when Frederick came to it; as they were when he left it; and as they were at the time of writing. &#x2026; The following memorandum [this letter of <date when="1857-09-16">16 Sept.</date>] will at least serve to show that the map-making business was now steadily progressing&#x201C; (Larkin, <hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 42&#x2013;43).

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I ought to send you a little word, tho&#x2019; it must be a very brief one,&#x2014;announcing at least that Jane is come home. I picked her up at the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Railway Station,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >King&#x2019;s Cross, London, where the Edinburgh trains arrived.</note> Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> gone a week (this is <hi rend="italic">Thursday night</hi>), and brought her home with me. She is very considerably improved; visibly changed in the <pb id="pg-33-87" n="33:87"/>look, and practically in all important particulars, as sleep, eating &#x26;c: in fact if she go on as she has done for the past week, it will have been an exceedingly successful expedition; and we may fairly calculate on fronting the winter on better omens than those of last year were.</p>
<p>This morning I got a Letter with a strange black card in it,&#x2014;announcing that good David Hope of Glasgow was dead and buried.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hope (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220323-TC-DH-01"><sic>2:71</sic><corr>TC to DH, <date when="1822-03-02">23 March 1822</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431220-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1843-12-20">20 Dec. 1843</date></ref>), Glasgow merchant, friend of William Graham and Edward Irving, d. <date when="1857-09-06">6 Sept.</date></note> The news came sorrowful upon me. He was one of the oldest acquaintances I had now in the world; always kind to me and true: no blither more innocent heart lived in the world. It often seems to me as if my world w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> grow, if I stay in it long, <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> solitary. I have lost, since last year,&#x2014;much, how much: and the like of me has daily less and less left. It is a wild scene this world;&#x2014;and I make the reflexions on it wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> all have made, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are new and strange to every new mortal that arrives at the stage of making them.</p>
<p>I stick like clockwork to my business: progress is far from brilliant; yet if I can hold out for a ten months more, I calculate on getting thro&#x2019; this first and far worst bout. I think I will then go to the Country, and for a whole year live upon milk and meal and honest <hi rend="italic">country</hi> fare, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing but sleep and ride! The Book will not perhaps be entirely worthless, tho&#x2019; not worth <hi rend="italic">much:</hi> but really that is next to no concern with me in comparison. If I were <hi rend="italic">honestly</hi> out of it, my thankfulness w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be great, regardless of other conditions.</p>
<p>We have bright hot weather again; very &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">mooth,</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;by no means agreeable to the working nerves. I often think of the busy shearing and <hi rend="italic">inning</hi> that must be afoot in Scotland;&#x2014;sore work truly, yet of a glad sort. We had deluges of rain before; very sore upon <hi rend="italic">men,</hi> still more upon <hi rend="italic">stooks.</hi>&#x2014; Our Town continues nearly empty of acquaintances: I have habitually no companion at all but my horse. All work &#x26; no play; making Jack a very dull boy at times,&#x2014;if it were to last always.</p>

<salute>My dear &#x201C;William Dodds&#x201C;</salute>
<p>Nature prompts me to write you a letter, &#x201C;all out of my own head&#x201C; (as the Children say);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> to thank you for the good you did me the other morning&#x2014;<pb id="pg-33-88" n="33:88"/>more, I dare say, than you proposed to yourself: for you not only smoothed my journey to London, as by magic; but you diffused some sunshine on my <hi rend="italic">Life-journey</hi> at a point where it was drowned in tears. Decidedly; you played the part of <hi rend="italic">Deus ex machina</hi> that morning, as successfully as on that other morning, long, long, long ago; when you lent me your white, cotton stockings, good God!</p>
<p>How well I remember it! and what a morning to be sure! all glancing like diamonds, and smelling of hawthorn and sweet briar, with the dew on them!&#x2014; Don&#x2019;t you find this Earth has changed its face amazingly for the worse, since then; especially in the <hi rend="italic">mornings;</hi> before breakfast has put a little life in one?&#x2014; Ach! It was in <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date> that Arcadian transaction of the cotton stockings! I cannot get the date forgotten; for it stands written, after my name and designation, in your hand-writing, on the rim of my mathematical-instrument-case I will show it you, if you like, when you come to see me.</p>
<p>You may be sure I lost neither myself nor my luggage with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Trotter for escort. At Dunbar he got his ticket exchanged for a first class one; and from that moment, &#x201C;stuck closer&#x201C; to me &#x201C;than a Brother&#x201C;! Had I been a box of gold-dust with thieves lying in wait for it; or an Infant, with no capacity except to suck; I couldn&#x2019;t have been kept more in his eye or more assiduously tended! Good innocent Man! And I to have gone and forgotten him out and out! Really, as much a stranger he was for me, when you brought him up and he stood there in his shoes, as if he had dropt that moment, full-grown, out of the Moon, and his name along with him! He asked if I recollected his &#x201C;stealing a piece of jasper&#x201C; from me; which he afterwards got cut into a seal? Oh no! not even <hi rend="italic">that!</hi> But had he been in the way of getting <hi rend="italic">above</hi> me in the class; <hi rend="italic">shouldn&#x2019;t</hi> I have remembered him with a <hi rend="italic">vividness!</hi>&#x2014;as I have always remembered <hi rend="italic">Tom Dodds</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Dods (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>), possibly William&#x2019;s brother.</note> whom I only got the better of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">by one</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014; My utter oblivion of him proves, I think, that dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Trotter must have been, as a boy, &#x201C;a considerable of a dunce&#x201C;!</p>
<p>I &#x201C;drew out the cushion&#x201C; (as you directed) and lay most of the way at full length&#x2014;a great mitigation of my fatigues Pray, did you find out that property of the cushions &#x201C;by your own sharpness&#x201C;? They <hi rend="italic">look</hi> as immovable as Arthurs Seat!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A hill of volcanic origin in Edinburgh.</note></p>
<p>On the whole, I suppose one should be thankful for the convenience of being shot, as out of a cannon, from Scotland to London &#x201C;in no time&#x201C;&#x2014;(my handkerchief when taken out of my reticule at Cheyne Row still wet with tears shed at <hi rend="italic">Haddington!</hi> Think of <hi rend="italic">that!</hi> all the way from Haddington to Chelsea travelled over, before tears had time to dry on a bit of cambric!)

<p>I heard from Miss Jess Donaldson that your Wife<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Dods.</note> &#x201C;called next day,&#x201C; to tell them of my having an escort to London&#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> it already, without being told; as well as if I had seen her, thro <hi rend="italic">Prince Ahmed&#x2019;s</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In &#x201C;The Story of Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Paribanou,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights&#x2019; Entertainments.</hi></note> wonderful Telescope, or in the little mirror <hi rend="italic">Beauty</hi> got from <hi rend="italic">the Beast,</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like Beauty seeing her father through the magic mirror given to her by the Beast in the fairy tale &#x201C;Beauty and the Beast.&#x201C;</note> put on her bonnet and shawl, and take the road to SunnyBank, and go in. Because, you see; it was exactly what a kind-hearted thoughtful woman would be certain to do; and when I kissed your wife at parting, it was exactly because I had seen in her these qualities, in a high degree.</p>
<p>Please tell her with my love; I hope she will go often to my dear old friends. They are not without people enough &#x201C;dropping in&#x201C; to call; but people who drop in to call are not invariably good company; when one happens to have some sense and feeling!&#x2014; I often pitied them from my heart, straining their poor deaf ears, to hear stuff I should have been ashamed to talk to my dog! and they so <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> and good! Your Wife appreciates them as I do, and sympathizes with their earnest, saddened manner of being. I perceived <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> in the little talk I had with her alone.

<salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
<p>I am happy, in obedience to your orders, to report that things go a little better here. I am out of my cold, or as good as out,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">into</hi> my old tribulations of the Treadmill, which there is no respite from for a long while, and no use talking about. The Wife too is decidedly <hi rend="italic">better,</hi> tho&#x2019; not yet by any means well. She has been downstairs these two days; and speaks even about venturing into the out-of-doors sunshine today,&#x2014;if the <hi rend="italic">sunshine</hi> itself w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> but appear! Which it seems rather reluctant to do. In short, we must hope this is but a temporary accident to poor <hi rend="italic">Missus;</hi> and that we shall rally, and begin the winter under better omens that are yet quite evident. If your Ladyship, at any leisure moment there may be, could think of writing her a little bulletin about yourself and your whereabout, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not fail to have a good effect.</p>
<p>I send you the Narrative of Brigadier Mackenzie&#x2019;s Affair at Bolarum;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560715-TC-JWP-01"><sic>31:121</sic><corr>TC to JWP, <date when="1856-07-15">15 July 1856</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570818-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1857-08-18">18 Aug.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;the prelude to all these horrible scenes that have come upon us. Mackenzie, who had still half a year of his furlough left, is off to India again, his wounds being healed;&#x2014;eager to be at his post in such a crisis. The Official treatment he has got in that Bolarum affair especially, is not of a very beautiful kind! In fact there never was such a management (in the matter of their Army at least) exhibited by mankind before, as ours in India and elsewhere has now for a good while been!&#x2014; I observe there is no class of persons so <hi rend="italic">confident</hi> about the results now coming out of India, as those that have no knowledge whatever about India, and very little ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> anything else. Mackenzie, and all experienced Indians I have seen, are extremely grave upon the matter; and only the Newspaper Editors<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For example, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> editorial, <date when="1857-09-25">25 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Wealth is on the side of prudence against rashness, of commercial nations against warlike hoards, and generally of civilization in its contest with barbarism. There is little doubt that English organization will outlast the impulses of Oriental violence.&#x201C; The rebellion continued throughout <date when="1857-08-00">Aug.</date>; more than 40,000 regulars of the Bengal army had mutinied and they were joined by thousands of armed civilians (Saul David, <hi rend="italic">The Indian Mutiny</hi> [<sic><date when="1857-00-00">1857</date></sic><corr><date when="2002-00-00">2002</date></corr>] 280). The situation turned against the rebels when Delhi was cleared of all rebel troops, <date when="1857-09-20">20 Sept.</date>, but news of this did not reach London until late <date when="1857-10-00">Oct.</date> Peace was not finally declared until <date when="1859-07-00">July 1859</date>.</note> see a glorious issue near and certain.&#x2014; &#x2014; Good be with you, dear Lady.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I couldn&#x2019;t for shame write to you last week&#x2014;for I couldn&#x2019;t in writing have withheld the fact that I had&#x2014;got a shocking bad <hi rend="italic">cold!</hi>&#x2014;(again!)&#x2014; Really I found myself making apologies, and explaining <hi rend="italic">the cause</hi> to every body who came in&#x2014;as if it had been a punishable offence against society I was committing. <pb id="pg-33-93" n="33:93"/>Harriet Martineau used to say of me, with that show of <hi rend="italic">accuracy</hi> never accurate which distinguishes her: &#x201C;Jane Carlyle has <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> Influenzas <hi rend="italic">annually;</hi> I wonder how she survives it&#x201C;! Now it is getting to be <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Influenza lasting all the year round&#x2014; However I must not lose heart; tho it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> disappointing to fall ill just when I had been taking all that trouble to strengthen myself, and with tolerable success apparently&#x2014; But really I should have needed the thick skin of a horse, instead of being &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">born without skin</hi>&#x201C; as the germans call those born, (as I was) in <hi rend="italic">the seventh month;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Born prematurely; cf. <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 12:194.</note> to resist the masked batteries of cold air, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C brought to bear on me during the east wind ten days ago! He has a mania about &#x201C;fresh air,&#x201C; this man&#x2014;and is never happy unless all the doors and windows are open. From <hi rend="italic">open violence</hi> of draughts I can partly defend myself; wearing a cloak and bonnet the same as if I were out of doors! &#x26;c&#x2014;but when he surreptitiously opens a window at my back (the back of my seat) when I am out of the room, and the curtains are drawn over it, I often receive my first notice of the fact in the form of a sore throat&#x2014; As he never takes cold himself, he can&#x2019;t be made to understand how sitting between two open cross windows, at midnight, in an east wind, should not be excessively bracing and healthy for me!&#x2014; However I have had the weather in my favour, and seem to be getting over the attack which was sharp enough while it lasted&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was really thankful to hear from you&#x2014; For I had been working myself into a <hi rend="italic">worry</hi> about your health.&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">That</hi> being the rock a-head with myself always&#x2014;; I am apt to fancy it every bodys rock a head, when there is any delay I dont understand&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope to hear of you from my Aunt Ann more particularly than you ever tell me about yourself&#x2014; Grace wrote the other day that she (Ann)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann and Grace Welsh.</note> was gone to &#x201C;her beloved Dumfriesshire&#x201C; but didn&#x2019;t say to what place of it first.</p>
<p>Poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Scott!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Catherine Corse Scott, m. to John Corse Scott of Ashkirk, Roxburghshire. Her sons, Lt. Col.

Edward Williams Corse Scott (b. <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>), were all serving in India.</note> What horrid anxiety she must be kept in! I thank God I have nobody belonging to me in India just now. It is miserable enough to think of the wretchedness of those who have! I fear it will be long enough before there is any safety for those who are there, or any peace for their friends at home. All the Indian officers I have seen, who have any sense, and experience of India think very badly of our chances of reducing it back to tranquility and if Madras and Bombay join the revolt they think we shall lose India altogether.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks again.

<p>I have been here all this while,&#x2014;no Scotland or other rustication for me, much as I wanted it;&#x2014;seldom in my life did I find myself in such a penal <hi rend="italic">treadmill;</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has to go on turning for a great many months yet, unless I myself break down too soon.&#x2014; My Wife came home, some four weeks ago, visibly improved by her Scotch expedition and sojourn with old friends: I am in hopes of a better winter for her than the last was, wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> indeed was a very bad one.</p>
<p>We have much to do with Indian news, in our solitude,&#x2014;if I did not endeavour to drive India out of my head as much as possible; as alas what can I do with it, or say to it! No nation, I think, ever managed an &#x201C;Army&#x201C; as England has done its for the last hundred years, and still does. If I were England, instead of &#x201C;punishing the sepoys&#x201C; with such exquisite industry (whom I have not yet got hold of), I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> set about punishing myself for such a course of stupidity and infidelity in my administrations Indian and other, as c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> or can lead to nothing <hi rend="italic">but</hi> destruction &#x26; damnation in some form!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s views are similar to those expressed by Karl Marx in the <hi rend="italic">New York Daily News,</hi> <date when="1857-09-16">16 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;As Delhi has not, like the walls of Jericho, fallen before mere puffs of wind, John Bull is to be steeped in cries for revenge up to his very ears, to make him forget that his Government is responsible for the mischief hatched and the colossal dimensions it had been allowed to assume&#x201C; (quot. in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, <hi rend="italic">The First Indian War of Independence, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1959-00-00">59</date></hi> [Moscow, <date when="1959-00-00">1959</date>] 76).</note>&#x2014; Come &#x26; see us. <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your two Notes to me,&#x2014;for your kind thought in regard to that matter of &#x201C;Voltaire at Frankfurt.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Varnhagen Von Ense, <hi rend="italic">Voltaire in Frankfurt am Main, <date when="1753-00-00">1753</date></hi> (Berlin, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>). TC&#x2019;s copy: HCC; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:370.</note> I already had a Copy of that excellent little Tract,&#x2014;fruit of your goodness to me at its first appearance;&#x2014;and have again studied it over, more than once, since these investigations began. It lies bound up with other interesting Pieces of a kindred sort; ready for use when the time comes<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No period in MS. TC wrote in <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> that &#x201C;Voltaire&#x2019;s flagrant Narrative&#x201C; had been called into question by &#x201C;Herr Varnhagen,&#x201C; who &#x201C;in a distinct, minute and entertaining way, explained the truth of it to everybody;&#x2014;leaving the Voltaire Narrative in rather sad condition. We &#x2026; give, compressed, from Varnhagen and the other evidences, a few of the characteristic points&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:370); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:370&#x2013;77.</note> But you are not to think this Second Copy wasted either; the little Pamphlet itself I have already turned to good account for my interests;&#x2014;and the fact of its being sent me on those terms has value which I would not willingly part with.</p>
<p>How often have I wished that I had you here &#x201C;as a Dictionary&#x201C;! But there is nothing such attainable in these latitudes:&#x2014;the truth is, I should have <hi rend="italic">come to Berlin</hi> to write this Book:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Wynn wrote to Varnhagen von Ense from Lucerne, <date when="1857-09-12">12 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Poor Carlyle! I fear his Frederic will worry him into a decline! and he is not a man whom one can advise to go to Germany where he would find the help he needs. He has made himself such a spoiled child that the common little annoyances of a journey make him wretched. And that is the man to whom we owe the sternest teaching of the age!&#x201C; (MS: Jagiellonian Univ.).</note> but I did not candidly enough <hi rend="italic">take measure</hi> of it, before starting, or admit to myself, what I dimly felt, how &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">gewaltig</hi> [vast]&#x201C; an affair it was sure to be! In that case, I had probably never attempted it at all. Nobody can well like his own performance <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than I in this instance: but it must be finished <hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi> [such as it may be]. Nay on the whole it needed to be done: the English are utterly, I may say disgracefully and stupidly <hi rend="italic">dark</hi> about all Prussian and German things;&#x2014;and it did behove that <hi rend="italic">some</hi> English man should plunge, perhaps on his mere English resources, into that black gulph, and tear-up some kind of human footpath <pb id="pg-33-98" n="33:98"/>that others might follow.&#x2014; At any rate, I hope to get it <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> and that will be reward enough for me, after the horrible <hi rend="italic">imprisonment</hi> I have had in it so long.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh-Review</hi> on Goethe I have not seen: somebody told me it was by Mrs Austin,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Character and Moral Influence,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> 106 (<date when="1857-00-00">July 1857</date>): 194&#x2013;226, by Sarah Austin, b.

She condemned Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;defective sense of moral obligation&#x201C; (198) and attributed it to &#x201C;an exaggerated conception of the benefits Art is capable of conferring on mankind&#x201C; (219).

According to Brougham, Frederick presented &#x201C;equal proofs of a tyrannical disposition, and examples of injustice and cruelty, altogether unparalleled in the history of civilized monarchies&#x201C; and had an &#x201C;intermeddling and controlling spirit&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works of Brougham</hi> 5:320, 325).</note>&#x2014;the speculations of Lord Brougham&#x2019;s Horse are as well worth attending to. And indeed are about <hi rend="italic">as much attended to</hi> by the best kind of people here! For I am happy to say there is, sparingly discoverable, a class among us of a silent kind, much superior to that vocal one;&#x2014;and many a &#x201C;Palmerston,&#x201C; &#x201C;Crimean War,&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c as mirrored in the Newspapers, and in the heads of those <hi rend="italic">Stillen im Lande</hi> [quiet in the land]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

What they call &#x201C;Liberty of the Press&#x201C; is become a thing not beautiful to look at in this country, to those who have eyes!</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>You would see that my last letter was written before receiving yours. Which was lying for me when I came in from putting mine in the Post Office!</p>
<p>I felt so keenly my old want of a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">flying carpet</hi>&#x201C; or a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">wishing cap</hi>&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570919-JWC-WDO-01">JWC to <sic>WD</sic><corr>WDO</corr>, [<date when="1857-09-19">19? Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> when I read about Ann &#x201C;coming to tea&#x201C; with you<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Welsh was visiting Dumfriesshire; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571002-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1857-10-02">2 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;it would have been so pleasant to join the party in that snug little drawingroom! tho&#x2019; I dare say Ann at least would have found that I was somewhat in the nature of those &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">pigs</hi>&#x201C; that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">run thro</hi>&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560901-JWC-DD-01"><sic>31:205</sic><corr>JWC to DD, <date when="1856-09-01">1 Sept. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> things when she was set in for an &#x201C;improving&#x201C; conversation! I like her so much but when she talks like &#x201C;a plain human creature&#x201C; (as the old Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lady<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350430-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:105</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-04-30">30 April 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> called herself) There is a mixture of humour and simplicity about her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">plain, human</hi>&#x201C; talk, that I find charming. She told me, when I was with them, the history of a little <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> dog of hers, that made me scream with laughter as I havn&#x2019;t laughed these seven years! If I had been there that evening, I should have turned her into that vein, and tried to bring a smile to your sad face my poor Dear! Oh I can figure how sad it has looked this long while!</p>
<p>In sorting away some papers the other day I came upon a letter from your dear Father to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle about a book he had sent him. Such a nice letter and so beautifully written! I felt as if I had found a jewel among rubbish, and layed it carefully by among the things I keep as <hi rend="italic">sacred.</hi></p>
<p>Since I returned home I have written to my old Ladies at Sunny Bank once a week. Every Wednesday I write to them. Your Father&#x2019;s death has helped to make me tremblingly alive to the frail hold <hi rend="italic">they</hi> have on life. Every year, every month they live seems a special mercy to me. And what makes me cling to them the more fondly is, that their affection for me seems to grow more intense, with the feeling of approaching separation. My parting from them was horribly painful. To see such old, old women weeping and sobbing as if their hearts would break! Oh I cannot recall it even now, without tears. The <pb id="pg-33-100" n="33:100"/>fact is I am more to them than anyone else <hi rend="italic">living.</hi> Their own generation all dead and gone&#x2014;and their nephews and nieces a frivolous, selfish set whom only the tie of blood attaches them to. When I think that someday before long, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> will be taken and the other left!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean d. <date when="1860-03-30">30 March 1860</date>, and Jess, <date when="1860-06-01">1 June 1860</date>.</note>&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Alone,</hi> utterly!&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">which</hi> will be left?&#x2014; But oh how vain such speculations! as if nothing killed but old age! I may not live to see their separation&#x2014; They may outlive many now in the bloom of youth and strength! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Afraid of the day one was never to see</hi>&#x201C; is such a good old proverb&#x2014;</p>
<p>Be sure to tell me when you write if there be any news of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Scott&#x2019;s sons. Poor woman! that her case is <hi rend="italic">common</hi> just now makes it no less pitiable.</p>
<p>I know of an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lady who has <hi rend="italic">disease of the heart.</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> The D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> sent her to the seaside while I was there with strict injunctions to &#x201C;avoid all excitement and agitation&#x201C;&#x2014;and she has a son of eighteen before Delhi! The only comfort I have had in reading about these Indian affairs is in the letters of some of the <hi rend="italic">women</hi>&#x2014; The men&#x2019;s letters are detestable generally&#x2014;mess room slang and affected <hi rend="italic">pococurante</hi>ism are shockingly out of place in these circumstances&#x2014;if they ever <hi rend="italic">are</hi> in place in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> circumstances. But some of the <hi rend="italic">women,</hi> afterwards murdered, write, in presence of their horrible fate, with a calm fortitude, and pious resignation that are <hi rend="italic">sublime;</hi> and which effaces from one&#x2019;s thought of them all <hi rend="italic">painful</hi> sense of degrading sufferings.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters and extracts of letters from India were pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> throughout <date when="1857-09-00">Sept.</date> and <date when="1857-10-00">Oct</date>. Most were from army officers, but several were from women, writing mainly about their daily lives; for example, a letter, <date when="1857-08-09">9 Aug.</date>, from &#x201C;a Lady at Mussourie,&#x201C; who wrote, &#x201C;We are very busy making clothes for our army before Delhi. They are very badly off for these things &#x2026; fighting as they have done so nobly, they really deserve to be provided for by us. &#x2026; Wonderful to say, though I never did such a thing in my life before, I have the management of our portion of the business, which keeps me busy from early morning to late at night&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1857-10-05">5 Oct.</date>); also in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1857-10-05">5 Oct.</date>, written <date when="1857-08-12">12 Aug.</date>, &#x201C;from a Lady at Agra&#x201C;: &#x201C;Here we are all quite well thank God but sadly tired of being cooped up in the fort. &#x2026; We are all very cheerful considering the circumstances and when we assemble outside our quarters we are almost a merry party.

The bitterness of death has been tasted by us, many, many times during the last fortnight. &#x2026; It is not hard to die oneself but to see a dear child suffer and perish, that is the hard, the bitter trial.&#x201C; The rebels entered Cawnpore, 5 June, and most of the Europeans, including women and children, were killed; the siege was not lifted until <date when="1857-10-10">10 Oct.</date> See also <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570810-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-08-10">10 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> No Devils torturings could make <hi rend="italic">their</hi> death other than beautiful, holy, almost enviable! so grandly the brave <hi rend="italic">souls</hi> assert themselves thro&#x2019; all!

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to hear of your coming up hither again. It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a great pleasure to me, in my inwardly altogether lonesome existence, if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were comfortably settled in some way, within reach of me:&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> alas, may probably never come about! Nay I myself always steadily think of getting quite away from these Babel localities, with their roaring tumults, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is become meaningless and nothing better to me,&#x2014;the instant I have done with this frightful job now on hand;&#x2014;that so, in some <hi rend="italic">rustic</hi> remote place, I might devote the remnant of my life to silence, rest, and <hi rend="italic">reflexion</hi> upon what is past, and upon what lies ahead, coming nearer every day! But that too is, more likely than otherwise, only a vain project; solacement of the fancy, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may never get itself realised in fact. &#x201C;The heart is free; <hi rend="italic">doch ist die Fuss gebunden</hi> [but the feet are shackled]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note>,&#x2014;to a terrible extent, in this world!</p>
<p>Jane had another whiff of cold (as I myself had, to accompany her) since her return; but that is gone again, some weeks ago: and she is going about, considerably at discretion (for her); and indeed, I perceive, is much better than she was this time twelvemonth. We may hope to have a <hi rend="italic">better</hi> winter, if we take care.</p>
<p>I am kept tied night and day to my unlovely occupation, and to maintaining the degree of health not incompatible with it. Riding has grown very irksome to me, in the dull weather, in the solitude, so <hi rend="italic">chaotic</hi> a solitude withal: but I persist honestly; and find real benefit in it. There seems to me little doubt but <pb id="pg-33-102" n="33:102"/>I am in rather <hi rend="italic">better</hi> health than when you saw me last, in spite of all this tribulation. For two days my Horse has been off work, and my lot has been walking, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a pleasant variety for the moment. Long ago the sage doctors here (especially my Stable-Keeper)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pearson Till, livery stables, 41 Manor St., Chelsea; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570101-TC-RF-01"><sic>32:67</sic><corr>TC to RF, <date when="1857-01-01">1 Jan.</date></corr></ref></note> demonstrated to me that I must shoe my horse &#x201C;with leather on the forefeet,&#x201C; to guard ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> stones. I did so,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it was ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> twice the expense, and the feet did not feel <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> by the measure, but the <hi rend="italic">reverse.</hi> What c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> an ignorant man say? Monday last, the poor Horse <hi rend="italic">shed</hi> one of his fore-shoes in Hammersmith; I led him to a forge, shoe in hand,&#x2014;a little wretch knocked it on again: &#x201C;charge, 1/6, Sir,&#x201C; only that! I paid, much marvelling in silence;&#x2014;but I had <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> the process of <hi rend="italic">leather</hi>-shoeing; ladleful of <hi rend="italic">pitch</hi> poured-in between the leather and the <hi rend="italic">frog,</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c:&#x2014;in fact, I now perceived what had <hi rend="italic">ailed</hi> my poor nag&#x2019;s feet all this while: and have peremptorily ordered all that rubbish to be peeled off him, &#x26; a common Christian shoe put! So that perhaps the &#x201C;1/6, Sir&#x201C; was cheap, after all.&#x2014;</p>

<p>Never mind that little rub in the least!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin recalled: &#x201C;With all this map-work painfully dragging about me, I suppose I began to fear that I might possibly be getting a little behind with my indexing, &#x26;c.; and must have written something to that effect which I now only vaguely remember&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 43).</note> Robson and Chapman are &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">thick</hi> on the withers,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., both were moving slowly.</note> we may hope; and as for me, I really do not wince at all,&#x2014;not the least matter to <hi rend="italic">me.</hi> It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> surely a thousand times better to do the thing well, and to the bottom, when one is at it!&#x2014; I have only one feeling, that of thankfulness to you (and to Providence for sending me <hi rend="italic">you</hi>);&#x2014;coupled with a <pb id="pg-33-103" n="33:103"/>perceptible regret, which is not wholly regret either, that you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have got such a load of work laid on you wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was not your own but mine!

<p>Well&#x2014;in consideration of <hi rend="italic">the ivy leaf</hi> in your last I forgive your silence, this time.&#x2014; But look sharp! and dont disappoint the romantic faith I felt in you.

Croker&#x2019;s edn. of Lord Hervey&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of George the Second</hi> (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), which TC had been reading recently; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571123-TC-PC-01">TC to PC, <date when="1857-11-23">23 Nov.</date></ref></note> (burning it directly after), you will understand mine <hi rend="italic">to</hi> him, and what you are solicited to do in the matter.&#x2014; Despatch by post, at any rate; and let no word more of it reach <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> I pray, in charity!</p>
<p>I had one or two things to say to you about the <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> Book.</p>
<p>1&#xB0; That Robson at the rate he is proceeding, will have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with the Second Volume about the beginning of March!&#x2014; That does not bring the History up to where I expected;&#x2014;yet will leave it at a fit point for pausing, namely at the <hi rend="italic">King&#x2019;s Accession,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vol. 2 of the <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date> edn. ends with bk. 10, and the death of Friedrich Wilhelm (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 14:261&#x2013;77); vol. 3 (<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>) begins with Frederick&#x2019;s accession (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 14:277&#x2013;310).</note> after all the wild convulsions of his <hi rend="italic">youth</hi> are past:&#x2014;in Two similar volumes, one may hope to finish it off in no great length of time afterwards.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were to be 6 vols., the last of which was pbd. in <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>.</note>&#x2014; But at this rate, you perceive, the Book will be ready in March!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vols. 1 and 2 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> were advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1858-10-02">2 Oct. 1858</date>, as now ready; a 2d edn. was then announced, <date when="1858-11-27">27 Nov.</date>, for early <date when="1858-12-00">Dec. 1858</date>; see <ref target="volume-32/ed-32-athanaeum-advertisements"><sic>32:221&#x2013;22</sic><corr>Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s Advertisements</corr></ref>.</note> So that there ought to be no <hi rend="italic">delay</hi> in Maps Woodcuts &#x26;c; quick movement henceforth;&#x2014;and especially the <hi rend="italic">Photograph Frontispiece</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be still more appropriate to a Book <hi rend="italic">ending</hi> where this does, and indeed will do very well <hi rend="italic">if</hi> rightly executed,&#x2014;not well if <hi rend="italic">not</hi>) ought to be at once set going!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The frontispiece of vol. 1 is Pesne&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Little Drummer&#x201C;; see <corr><ref target="volume-31/lt-18560806-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1856-08-06">6 Aug. 1856</date></ref>,</corr> <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560807-TC-RST-01"><sic>31:152</sic><corr>TC to RST, <date when="1856-08-07">7 Aug. 1856</date></corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:opp. 370.</note></p>
<p>I myself do not want such speed as Robson is going at,&#x2014;and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like rather <hi rend="italic">better,</hi> if there were more leisure granted me, and we did not end till (for example) <hi rend="italic">May.</hi> But <hi rend="italic">despatch</hi> in a Printer (with correctness of work) is so rare a virtue, I have never liked to check him.</p>
<p>2&#xB0; I want to ask you about the American <hi rend="italic">Reprinting.</hi> Whatever money lies <pb id="pg-33-107" n="33:107"/>in that, it would be a folly in me not to have.

I want you to tell me what the Real sum is;&#x2014;and to help me in getting it, whatever <hi rend="italic">it</hi> may be.</p>
<p>I think of venturing on your slippery pavements, and calling for a few minutes<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s offices, 193 Piccadilly.</note> (perhaps <hi rend="italic">Monday 4 p.m.</hi>);&#x2014;but do not wait beyond 4&#xBC; and expect me <hi rend="italic">next</hi> day on the same terms.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>I have received your beautiful volume, probably the finest bit of typography that ever came before me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Poetical Works</hi> (<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), pbd. at the expense of Algernon Percy (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>; <ref target="volume-33/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21924"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 4th duke of Northumberland. James noted in his introduction to <hi rend="italic">Lyrical and other Minor Poems</hi> that it was &#x201C;printed in colours &#x2026; and in a style of beauty and magnificence which I do not remember to have seen equalled by the provincial press. The designs for the illuminated letters were made in Newcastle, the paper was manufactured in Northumberland, and the book bound in Newcastle, with leather dressed on the Tyne. All the accessories thus accorded with a book which breathed the poetry of Northumbria. The mere expense of adorning the work cost his Grace five hundred pounds. &#x2026; One thousand impressions were struck off, at the price, for large copies, of one guinea, and for small ones of ten shillings and six pence&#x201C; (lxix).</note> and have looked over it with interest <pb id="pg-33-108" n="33:108"/>and pleasure&#x2014;certainly with hearty good-will to the amiable and worthy brother-man who sketches out in that manner his pilgrimage through this confused world, alongside of me. A certain rustic vigour of life, breezy freshness, as of the Cheviot hills;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Range of hills extending NE to SW along the English-Scottish border, described by Story in &#x201C;The Hills of my Birth-place&#x201C; (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>): &#x201C;The hills of my birth-place I gazed on once more! / And Cheviot&#x2014;their Monarch&#x2014;sublime as of yore, / With the snow for his mantle, the cloud for his crown, / On the white vales beneath him looked royally down!&#x201C; (106).</note> a kindly healthiness of soul breathes every where out of the book. No one that reads it, I should think, but will feel himself the better for its influences. I can honestly wish success to it; and to its author, peace and comfort for the days and years that remain. <closer><salute>With many thanks and regards, I remain, yours sincerely,</salute></closer> <name>T. <hi rend="small-caps">Carlyle</hi>.</name></p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I have not forgotten you; farther than ever from that. I daily <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> of your bounty, and with much more thankfulness than you might fancy by my silence. That dainty Package, it was very kind of you, and very &#x201C;spirited&#x201C;: I am only sorry you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have had such bother:&#x2014;but indeed there is no good thing to be done on other terms. I am pleasantly called <hi rend="italic">home</hi> into loving circles by these Gifts; and that is what you intended with them.</p>
<p>But ever since that Box came, I have been so <hi rend="italic">driven</hi> as you never saw or c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> imagine; <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than ever just about this time. It has lasted now above twelve-months, life of a hare before hounds;&#x2014;and there is still a long course ahead! However, if I can hold out till May next, the <hi rend="italic">First Part</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi></note> will be done (2 thick Volumes then): and I shall fairly get to some rest again. A long effectual spell of rest; <hi rend="italic">as far</hi> from this tremendous Babel and its noises as I can get,&#x2014;and till I am quite <hi rend="italic">tired</hi> of resting! We are just getting out of the <hi rend="italic">First</hi> Vol. now;&#x2014;in fact, the back of the thing is broken, were I rid of this immediate coil of confusions. Courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane keeps up; very weakly; but takes no cold yet, and manages endurably in the matter of sleep. I too seem to be about my usual state,&#x2014;thanks chiefly to my Horse, I think. Nobody can be more regular and diligent.</p>
<p>The good Jim must not think of London and <hi rend="italic">me;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her eldest son James (&#x201C;Jamie&#x201C;) Aitken. Presumably he had expressed an interest in helping TC with his work. He had been employed as a clerk in Glasgow, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date> (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531118-TC-JCA-01"><sic>28:315</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1853-11-18">18 Nov. 1853</date></corr></ref>) but had left owing to unexplained trouble, after which TC and John A. Carlyle had tried to help him find other employment (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540411-TC-JAC-01"><sic>29:63</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1854-04-11">11 April 1854</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541104-TC-JAC-01"><sic>185&#x2013;86</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1854-11-04">4 Nov. 1854</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541104-TC-DH-01"><sic>190</sic><corr>TC to DH, <date when="1854-11-04">4 Nov. 1854</date></corr></ref>). He returned home to Dumfries, <date when="1854-11-00">Nov. 1854</date> (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541122-TC-JF-01"><sic>29:205</sic><corr>TC to JF, [<date when="1854-11-22">22 Nov. 1854</date>]</corr></ref>), but was working in Glasgow again by mid-<date when="1855-02-00">Feb. 1855</date> (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550216-TC-JCA-01"><sic>29:266</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1855-02-16">16 Feb. 1855</date></corr></ref>). TC had advised him to go back to his old employers, Liepmann &#x26; Lehmann, commission merchants (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550112-TC-JCA-01"><sic>29:236</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1855-01-12">12 Jan. 1855</date></corr></ref>), but by late<date when="1855-08-00">Aug. 1855</date>, he was working for Roxburgh, Richardson &#x26; Co., insurance, shipbrokers, and general agents, 7 Royal Exchange Pl., Glasgow, and living in new lodgings at Killermont St. (see Jean Carlyle Aitken to TC, <date when="1855-08-25">25 Aug. 1855</date>; MS: NLS 1775B.166). At the end of <date when="1857-02-00">Feb. 1857</date>, John A. Carlyle enlisted the help of James Carlyle, James and Isabella&#x2019;s son, even though the two cousins apparently did not get on (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540606-TC-JCA-01"><sic>29:111&#x2013;12</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1854-06-06">6 June 1854</date></corr></ref>). John wrote to James Carlyle, <date when="1857-03-02">2 March 1857</date>, thanking him &#x201C;for the pains you took on Saturday at my request&#x201C; and saying that he had written that day to Mr. Stevenson (possibly William Stevenson, commission agent and house factor of 9 Cambridge St., Glasgow, or William Stevenson &#x26; Sons, cotton spinners, S Exchange Court, 77 Queen St. [see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530729-TC-JACA-01"><sic>28:236</sic><corr>TC to JACA, <date when="1853-07-29">29 July 1853</date></corr></ref>]), James Carlyle&#x2019;s employer, regarding the possible employment of James Aitken: &#x201C;You seem to me to take a most reasonable view of the matter, &#x26; I think you went as far as you could in the way of indirect advice. &#x2026; I am perfectly sure that you will never repent the decision you have taken for your dear mother&#x2019;s sake. &#x2026; I have told Mr S that you will be ready to answer any questions you can respecting your cousin&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086). James Aitken appears not to have been employed by Stevenson; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580210-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1858-02-10">10 Feb. 1858</date></ref>.</note> he cannot be of the least <pb id="pg-33-110" n="33:110"/>use here;&#x2014;and at any rate I would by no means lead him away from his right pursuit. Let him hold on <hi rend="italic">steadily:</hi> he is a really good lad (so far as I can construe him); and he need not doubt good <hi rend="italic">is</hi> ahead of him, if he persevere. The other day a wretched Glasgow Clerk<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> &#x201C;intent on Literature&#x201C; &#x26;c called (not admitted), then wrote;&#x2014;I subjoin his Note; wh<hi rend="italic">h burn,</hi> and say nothing to Jim of it.

<p>The Mackenzies<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen and Colin Mackenzie.</note> set out for India, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Brussels, a fortnight after my return; but they were with us three evenings.

<p>Sir Colin writes that &#x201C;if there was any nonsense in the english newspapers about Lord Canning and he not drawing well together, no word of it was to be believed; for nothing could exceed the kindness, and furtherance in every way, which he had been met with by both Lord and Lady Canning.&#x201C;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Canning had been accused of being too lenient on the mutineers after his &#x201C;Resolution,&#x201C; <date when="1857-07-31">31 July</date>, which distinguished between sepoys from regiments that had committed bloodshed and those who were unarmed and innocent. Public opinion was firmly against &#x201C;Clemency Canning,&#x201C; particularly following the capture of Delhi, <date when="1857-09-20">20 Sept.</date>, but Campbell agreed that restraint was vital to gaining the support of the Indian population. In a letter to Lady Canning, <date when="1857-10-22">22 Oct.</date>, the queen welcomed the news that Sir Colin supported Canning&#x2019;s policy, and &#x201C;does not share that indiscriminate dislike of all brown skins which is very unjust&#x2014;for the Inhabitants have, it appears, taken no part in this purely Military Revolution&#x2014;&#x26; while summary punishment must alas! be dealt out to the mutinous sepoys&#x2014;I trust he will see that great forebearance is shown towards the innocent &#x26; that women &#x26; children will not be touched by <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> soldiers&#x201C; (quot. in Virginia Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Charlotte Canning: Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Victoria and Wife of the first Viceroy of India, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date></hi> [<date when="1975-00-00">1975</date>] 244).</note> He says too that he has &#x201C;a dreadful quantity of writing to do&#x201C;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">writing</hi> not being quite so easy for Colin as fighting!

Reluctantly she agreed and allowed him to call: &#x201C;But Mrs. Carlyle soon after appeared at our house, and the expression of her countenance was ominous as she entered the room. &#x2018;I have come to thank you,&#x2019; she said, in an ironical tone, &#x2018;not, as you may expect, for having induced me to change my purpose, but I thank you for having taught me a lesson&#x2014;never to try to make peace between those who have resolved to quarrel.&#x2019;&#x201C; She explained that Sterling had brought her, &#x201C;the most sensitive and superstitious of women, &#x2026; the headgear that he had taken from the body of a dead Highlander in the Crimean War, and asked me to take care of it for him. Can you imagine anything which could better prove how little he understands me? All is over between us. It is worse than it was before.&#x201C; Sterling called again, and, after he had left for India, JWC said that he had made up for his earlier insensitivity by bringing her an old tea caddy that had belonged to his mother: &#x201C; &#x2018;He said he believed I was the only human being now living who would value it, <hi rend="italic">for his mother&#x2019;s sake</hi>. &#x2026;&#x2019; And as she spoke she burst into tears&#x201C; (&#x201C;Some Reminiscences of Jane Welsh Carlyle,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Temple Bar</hi> 69 [<date when="1883-10-00">Oct. 1883</date>]: 232).</note> sailed yesterday <pb id="pg-33-113" n="33:113"/>morning, &#x201C;to take some of the writing off him poor Fellow!&#x201C;&#x2014; For the rest, it is Sir Colin&#x2019;s idea, that Delhi once taken, there will be little more fighting; but that the Army will have to transform itself into a great Police Force.&#x2014;</p>

The great thing is to be quite <hi rend="italic">intelligible.</hi> I leave it with you in this stage.</p>

<p><pb id="pg-33-116" n="33:116"/>With the <hi rend="italic">German</hi> affair,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Concerning the German publication of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> in English and in trans.</note> I am sorry to answer, there seems nothing to be done. The &#x201C;right of translation&#x201C; I gave away, long since, to a Mr Neuberg here (who has been extremely useful to me): he &#x2018;sold&#x2019; it to the Court-Publishers (Decker at Berlin) for the magnificent sum of nothing at all (<hi rend="italic">such</hi> being the Decker view of it); and he has the Translation mostly done,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first two vols. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> trans. into German by Neuberg, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte Friedrichs II. von Preussen genannt Friedrich der Grosse</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>), were pbd. by R.

<p>Then as to, Tauchnitz and reprinting the Book in Germany, Tauchnitz wrote to me about that a long time ago; I made Neuberg answer him &#x201C;&#xa3;50 a volume,&#x201C; and correspond with him; Tauchnitz (according to Neuberg&#x2019;s report) professed himself ready or about ready,&#x2014;&#x201C;w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> employ W<hi rend="italic">m&#x2019;s</hi> &#x26; Norgate to make the bargain with me.&#x201C; W<hi rend="italic">m&#x2019;s</hi> &#x26; Norgate seem to have taken up the notion, and given it to him, that they c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have the article for half-price; they have been obliquely trying <hi rend="italic">me</hi> on those terms, and have now written formally to you.&#x2014; The answer, I consider, in these circumstances ought to be: If Herr Tauchnitz does not like the Book at &#xa3;50 per volume (money down when he gets the sheets), let it remain unprinted,&#x2014;we are in no hurry ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571112-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1857-11-13">13</date> <date when="1857-11-12">[12] Nov.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; The fact is, nothing <hi rend="italic">runs away</hi> with the reprinting there, as is the fatal case in America.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where it might be printed without authority from or payment to TC; cf. <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561202-TC-RWE-01"><sic>32:39&#x2013;40</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1856-12-02">2 Dec. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> And we can let the W<hi rend="italic">ms</hi> &#x26; Norgate obliging speculation take the air for a while.</p>

<p>Lady Sandwich, good old Lady-Mother, is tolerably well; cheery and talky, when I called, the other evening.

    <salute>My dearest Mary</salute>
    <p>I had actually miscounted about whose turn it was to write; and am almost glad I did; since it has been the occasion for your writing me such a dear kind letter on &#x0201C;the voluntary principle&#x0201D;! Dont suppose however I should have kept silence much longer even in the mistaken idea you owed me a letter. It had been in my head to write for many days back; but what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle calls &#x0201C;a pressure of <hi rend="italic">things</hi>&#x0201D; has made it difficult for me to carry out my own inclinations in any one direction. Thank God I have not to enumerate, among the <hi rend="italic">Things</hi> pressing, a <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> being my bugaboo now&#x02014; I have been ill with that thing which, for want of a better name, I call &#x0201C;my <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi>&#x0201D; and for which I know only one cure to &#x0201C;pack my carpet-bag&#x0201D; (as D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell advised) and rush out into space! But <hi rend="italic">it</hi> does not confine me to the house, that sickness; and does not plague anyone but myself&#x02014; I am <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to <hi rend="italic">it</hi> (as the pigs to killing) Neither does it prevent me writing letters&#x02014;only makes my letters like every thing else I do <hi rend="italic">spiritless.</hi>&#x02014; My chief impediment has been that weary Artist <pb id="pg-33-120" n="33:120" />who took the bright idea last spring that he would make a picture of our sitting room<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Robert Tait and his painting <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior.</hi> John Ruskin, who had been in Scotland with his parents until mid-Oct., presumably saw the picture for the first time in Nov. He gave his judgment in two letters (both undated; one is written on stationery watermarked <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> and both probably written while advice could still be given to Tait, i.e., before the painting was finished, <date when="1858-04-05">5 April 1858</date>). In what is apparently the first letter, he wrote: &#x0201C;I like the little composition very much&#x02014;but it isn&#x02019;t quite right&#x02014;nor can I suggest what would put it right&#x02014;I can only do as you bid me, &#x26; mention the little things which seem to me wrong&#x0201D;; he lists six complaints, including, &#x0201C;Books should always be grave in colour, especially books behind the head of a historian&#x02019;s wife. Everybody would want to know what you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have been reading&#x0201D;; &#x0201C;Too much insistence on slender waist&#x0201D;; and &#x0201C;People will say Mrs Carlyle is indolent.&#x0201D; In the second letter, he discussed Tait&#x02019;s faulty perspective: &#x0201C;That if he stands in any point he choose in the room, and tries to get his canvas to hide from his eye all that he has drawn of it, he will find that he cannot do it. He thus violates the first rule of perspective by making his point of station imaginary, or rather impossible. &#x02026; / The second point to be noted is that even in the supposition of his point of station being possible, I believe the returning distances are not drawn to true scale. &#x02026; I think he has given the inner room too much recess by an inaccurate use of his measuring line. If he will cut two or three inches off the top and bottom of his picture however it will be very nearly right.&#x0201D; Apparently Tait did not follow his advice; for his note on the perspective, see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580329-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1858-03-29">29 March 1858</date>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Looking back a year and half, or more, you may perhaps be able to recal a <hi rend="italic">Letter of Lord Hervey&#x2019;s</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hervey (<date when="1696-00-00">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480413-TC-JF-01"><sic>23:20</sic><corr>TC to JF, [<date when="1848-04-14">13 April 1848</date>]</corr></ref>), Lord Hervey of Ickworth, pamphleteer and memoir writer.</note> (date about <date when="1733-00-00">1733</date> or &#x2019;34, to whom addressed I have forgotten; giving a lively sketch of the sublime <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi> and hopeless solemn vacancy of George II&#x2019;s Court, on a certain evening at Windsor),&#x2014;which was shewn you by Forster, on my part, for the sake of getting some commentary from you on one or two of the Figures introduced. The Commentary, I remember, was kindly afforded: my Copy of the Letter with your commentary on it, and all the proper <hi rend="italic">Apparatus Criticus,</hi> was there upon safely reposited here,&#x2014;no doubt in the best place I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> choose for finding it again when the time sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come.</p>
<p>Well; time has <hi rend="italic">come,</hi>&#x2014;some use possible in that Letter for me <hi rend="italic">now</hi> or else no chance of any ever;&#x2014; &#x2014;and, for my life, I cannot come upon the trace of it; cannot even find out what <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> it was got from: it has gone again, like a little fish caught, into the immeasurable ocean with all its fishes and whales!&#x2014; It is not in Hervey&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of George II;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hervey, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Reign of George the Second,</hi> ed.

<p>Don&#x2019;t mind the Hervey letter <hi rend="italic">much,</hi> or make long search after it. If you report nothing, I will make shift with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it, better or worse shift, who knows <hi rend="italic">which!</hi></p>

Munro warned against introducing freedom of the press in India: &#x201C;Were the people all our countrymen, I would prefer the utmost freedom of the press; but as they are, nothing could be more dangerous than such freedom. &#x2026; We are trying an experiment never yet tried in the world; maintaining a foreign dominion by means of a native army, and teaching that army, through a free press, that they ought to expel us and deliver their country. &#x2026; It is only as regards the natives, that the press can be viewed with apprehension; and it is only when it comes to agitate our native army, that its terrible effects will be felt&#x201C; (3, 11). Lord Canning&#x2019;s suspension of the press in India, <date when="1857-06-12">12 June</date>, restricted both the English-language and Indian press by making them apply for licenses that could be withdrawn without notice. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> opposed the legislation, with the latter arguing, <date when="1857-09-12">12 Sept.</date>, that Canning should have limited &#x201C;the liberty of the press in India to publications in the English language. &#x2026; As to the Indians, they never will be fit to be entrusted with the liberty of the press in their own tongues as long as they stand towards us in the relation of conquered to conquerors.&#x201C;</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I was very glad of.

<p>But <hi rend="italic">the fright?</hi>&#x2014;gracious goodness, the fright is worth telling about!&#x2014; I have a servant whom, during five years that she has been with me, I had never seen in a hurry, or excited, or deprived of her presence of mind.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne had been at 5 Cheyne Row since <date when="1853-11-00">Nov. 1853</date>.</note> What then was my astonishment when she rushed into the drawing room last night, with her head <hi rend="italic">tumbled off</hi> (as at first it looked to me) and carrying it in her hands!! and crying wildly &#x201C;Oh Mam! I must go to a Doctor! (scream) my ear my ear!

I called up M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, for I had lost all presence of mind as well as herself&#x2014; He took it coolly, as he takes most things; &#x201C;Syringe it,&#x201C; he said; &#x201C;syringing will bring out <hi rend="italic">any amount of black beetles!!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; There is an apothecary at the bottom of our street;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Hayward Savill Smith, chemist, 47 Cheyne Walk; see also <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:220</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-21">21 Nov. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> I threw a table cover about her, and told her to run to him; and I begged M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to go with her, as it was a dangerous thing for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to go out in the night air. &#x201C;Go with her?&#x201C; he said; &#x201C;What good could it do <hi rend="italic">my</hi> seeing the Beetle taken out of her ear?&#x201C;&#x2014; But I had read in a newspaper not long ago of a man killed, by some insect creeping into his ear; and how did I know the apothecary was not an ass, and might spoil her hearing for life with probes and things&#x2014;if indeed she did not die of it,! or go raving mad, as I should do in her place I thought!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-33-126" n="33:126"/>I paced up and down the room for some ten minutes like a wild animal in its cage; then put on a cloak and bonnet and rushed after her&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C running after <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> to pull me back.

I was better pleased that this man should not <hi rend="italic">probe</hi> any more&#x2014; If she does not <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> with it tomorrow I will send her to a regular Surgeon.

      <salute>Dear Brother,&#x02014;</salute>
      I hope you are coursing prosperously southward again, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this time. I did not want anything in Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi>
      <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">John had been on a trip to Edinburgh to settle Arthur Watt for the winter, early <date when="1857-11-00">Nov.</date> He wrote to TC, <date when="1857-11-03">3 Nov.</date>, that &#x0201C;[t]he thought of getting into some house of my own is hardly ever out of my mind. Up till August last I had not got quite rid of my Chancery Suit and Ship-owning; I believe it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hardly have been possible for me to live <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> in any new place even if my affairs had been settled. I do not know that I could stand solitary house-keeping even yet. I have no &#x0201C;society&#x0201D; at all here, but can at least think my own thoughts in peace &#x26; freedom. The problem of rushing into new relations at my time of life is not easy to solve, &#x26; no one can help me much in the solution of it. If I could see my way I should be quick &#x26; resolute enough. Were there any house, in any place not quite foreign to me, to be had, I should probably take it at once &#x26; make trial of house-keeping. Sometimes of late I have turned to old Craigenputt<hi rend="italic">k</hi> &#x26; thought of it as a kind of resource though the place is too remote &#x26; solitary. The house, it seems, has many windows &#x26; some of the floors sadly decayed&#x02014;probably from the damp after Thomas Bell&#x02019;s death&#x02014;&#x26; the new tenant often speaks to Jamie about it, and has spoken to Adamson till he is tired. Jamie says also that he thinks the new tenant might easily be persuaded to live in the smaller house instead of the larger one. All the woods too should be looked after. Now you have no time at all to bestow on thinking of such things, &#x26; one cannot well think of them for you without much botheration. &#x02026; My immature project was to buy Craigenputtock from you, &#x26; have it set in order on my own account. Lime, draining, fencing, planting are all wanted; &#x26; Jamie says the farm &#x0201C;is dear enough, even in these dear times,&#x0201D; considering the state it has gradually fallen into by exhaustion of old improvements. &#x02018;It is not half so good as it was when Alick was there,&#x02019; he says. / / If I were able to try life again amid those stern solitary woods, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at least be able to give you a welcome at any time.

<salute>Dear Lewes,</salute>
<p>The German Translation of that Book is in the hands of Neuberg;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Frederick;</hi> see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571113-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1857-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref></note> and he has settled about it (with Decker of Berlin) months and years ago. The English <hi rend="italic">Reprint</hi> is still open. Tauchnitz of Leipzig applied a long while ago; I set Neuberg to ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> him, &#x201C;&#xa3;50 a Volume&#x201C;; and keep it off <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> Neuberg corresponded accordingly, and reported Tauchnitz as prepared to assent: Tauchnitz employed W<hi rend="italic">ms</hi> &#x26; Norgate, however, who I conjecture advised him to offer <hi rend="italic">Half;</hi>&#x2014;this at any rate they, in his name, not long since, did offer; and it was rejected, and is not likely to be accepted for a good while (I should guess). That is the state of the English Reprint: Vol I lately done, is of 634 pages (if I recollect): Vol II, expected to be ready in May.</p>
<p>I have had such a 14 months as was never appointed me before in this world,&#x2014;sorrow, darkness and disgust, my daily companions; and no outlook visible except getting a detestable business turned off, or else being driven mad by it.&#x2014; In a three months more, I hope to be at large again, and capable of seeing those I like.</p>

    <p>Nothing is wrong with us; don&#x02019;t be under apprehension Jane goes about; seems rather fresher if anything lately: indeed I suspect the critical time has not yet come,&#x02014;till the jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> or feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> cold days arrive.

    <p>Jane&#x02019;s chief suffering at present is the burden of two innocent young Auchtertool Damsels, &#x0201C;Maggy&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;Mary&#x0201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Welsh.</note> who are here on their road to the Isle of Wight; Mary, sickly for a long while past, having been ordered thither for a better climate in the cold season.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Would you be so good as call again, and tell Mr Robson that I am well aware of the &#x201C;irregular&#x201C; character of the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> (probably the most irregular he ever had to do with!)&#x2014;but that on the whole he must contrive to give me some guess of it. His <hi rend="italic">guess</hi> will be better than mine; and that latter (a very dark rule indeed) is all I have to go by at present!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If Mr Levey<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Levey of Robson, Levey &#x26; Franklyn, 23 Gt. New St. and Fetter Lane.</note> will take the thing in hand, and form his best opinion, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> telling anybody; and then if Mr Robson will <hi rend="italic">do the like,</hi>&#x2014;I should suppose the <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> of those two computations would be near the truth. On the whole I <pb id="pg-33-136" n="33:136"/><hi rend="italic">must</hi> form some kind of notion; and how am <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to do it!&#x2014; Tell them to do their best for me; and thereby I shall at least be much <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi> the fact than at present.</p>
<p>I have no doubt the <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> is considerably illuminated by your faithful labour upon it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580108-TC-HL-01">TC to HL, <date when="1858-01-08">8 Jan. 1858</date></ref>.</note> I will with great pleasure read a Proofsheet (and send you my remarks) if you can get me one in time.</p>
<p>If I knew the extent of that <hi rend="italic">Ms.,</hi> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> now go ahead for the <hi rend="italic">conclusion</hi> of this First Part of Fr<hi rend="italic">h.</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be a deliverance indeed, to the weary human soul!&#x2014;</p>

<p>I understood that your Brother would write himself today, to announce the safe arrival of your box&#x2014;the contents of which were exhibited to him in succession last night, (When it came to the goose, carried in on my arms, like a strange new kind of Baby (with that belly-band about it!) he burst into such a laugh! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">That</hi> fellow I think has got his quietus&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 3.1.</note> (he said&#x2014;) But now he has just come down and is off for his ride, and when I asked; &#x201C;had he written to Mary&#x201C;? he exclaimed <hi rend="italic">wildly</hi> that he had &#x201C;fifteen hours of the most <hi rend="italic">awful</hi> work, of correcting proofs a-head of him&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">I who had nothing to do</hi> should have written to Mary&#x201C;&#x2014; With all the pleasure in life! had I known in time; instead of within just half an hour of post time&#x2014;from which is to be subtracted ten minutes for putting on my things and running to the post office!&#x2014; But better a line than no letter at all till tomorrow&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">you</hi> thinking the while that all those blessed birds may be coming to harm&#x2014;from being too long on the road! no my Dear! one &#x201C;Chuka&#x201C; is boiling at this moment for the masters dinner (I dine on <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> at two o&#x2019;clock; not being up to waiting for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s six or seven o clock dinners)&#x2014; But I had one of the eggs to my breakfast and it was the very best and biggest I ever eat in my life!&#x2014;there were only <hi rend="italic">two</hi> broken and not <hi rend="italic">wasted</hi> even these: I lifted up the yokes which lay quite <hi rend="italic">round</hi> and whole in a spoon!

<p>I wish I had begun in time for I had plenty of things to say&#x2014;but I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> keep for this time to mere acknowlegement of your present&#x2014;another day I may tell you the rest Yours ever affectionately</p>

<salute>My dear Brother</salute>
<p>I have been too long in writing; but there really is no limit to the hurry and confusion I am kept in here;&#x2014;very weak and spirit less, too, for most part;&#x2014;and in fact there was nothing passing wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> much called me out into writing.</p>
<p>Your tour to the North w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a pleasant break in the stillness of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Scots-brig life: but probably you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be glad to get back again into quiet; for I suppose you have got used to it by this time, and may prefer the comparative absence from annoyance to any satisfaction you could get from variety or society. You have no mention of a tour this way, of late? It is about a year since you have not seen London nor London you:&#x2014;but indeed there is but little to invite a quiet soul to, in this more and more chaotic element.</p>
<p>We had the two Miss Welshes from Auchtertool for an eight days lately. They were bound for the Isle of Wight, whither the Younger had been ordered for chance of benefit by the &#x201C;better air.&#x201C; She is not well, poor thing; but I do not fancy better air will do much for her: change of scene, and interruption to the monotony of indolent ennui may perhaps be beneficial for the time,&#x2014;and that may have been what the Dr. really meant by his order.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. James Dewar; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570803-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-08-03">3 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; The poor Lasses are very innocent amiable creatures: they did <hi rend="italic">me</hi> no ill while here; but were a little hard upon &#x201C;Cousin,&#x201C; who is not fit for much supervision and House-generalship in her present weak state. They went off, Thursday last,&#x2014;forgetting only a &#x201C;hamper&#x201C; here;&#x2014;they got safe to Ventnor,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Resort town, Isle of Wight; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490703-TC-JWC-01"><sic>24:93</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1849-07-03">3 July 1849</date></corr></ref>. John Sterling d. there; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440920-TC-JAC-01"><sic>18:214&#x2013;15</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1844-09-20">20 Sept. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> to certain Liddells who are there, with whom they are to stay for a week till they get lodgings of their own.</p>
<p>We seem about to get into frost, our <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of this season; and I am anxious about my poor Helpmate in regard to that. She is very feckless; tho&#x2019; full of spirit, when she can get the least chance; <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> is still a scarcity; and <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> temperature seems to tell on her at once.&#x2014; I am actually getting into the last &#x201C;Book&#x201C; of my <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> for this bout! Nothing <hi rend="italic">can</hi> come more ungainly than every bit of that unfortunate work has done; no end to difficulty, to despicable fash, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the despicable enterprise: but, by Heaven&#x2019;s help, there begins to be daylight thro&#x2019; this First Part of it,&#x2014;as above said. The Printer is nearly thro Book I of Vol II; and he cannot now catch me, tho&#x2019; marching with uncommon steadiness. &#x201C;By the end of May,&#x201C; I hope to be safe in some rustic solitude, &#x201C;upon milk diet,&#x201C; and in blessed depth of &#x201C;silence,&#x201C; for an unlimited period!&#x2014; You can tell Jamie and Isabella, the <hi rend="italic">meal</hi> proves excellent; and gives <pb id="pg-33-140" n="33:140"/>one a morsel of innocent supper every night; a thing to be reckoned among the blessings of the 24 hours. We were busy on the Ham too (for which, I hope, Jane duly thanked the kind donors!),&#x2014;when a body of eggs &#x26;c from the Gill suspended that attack for some time. We are much indebted for kind remembrances from those who love us tho&#x2019; hidden from them.</p>
<p>All mortals are tumbling about, in a state of drunken <hi rend="italic">Saturnalia</hi> delirium or quasi-delirium, according to their various sorts: a very strange method of &#x201C;thanking God for sending them a <hi rend="italic">Redeemer</hi>&#x201C;;&#x2014;a set singularly worth &#x201C;redeeming,&#x201C; too, you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say! I spent X<hi rend="italic">mas</hi> and the two days following in grim contention, all day each time, with the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> refractory set of Proofsheets I expect in this Work;&#x2014; &#x2014;tho sternly done. Tait has finished his &#x201C;Picture&#x201C; of the Interior; at least he has taken it away,&#x2014;thank Heaven. &#x201C;Leviathan&#x201C; cannot be launched at all!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571207-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1857-12-07">[7] Dec.</date></ref></note> We think of going to see it some day for a holiday,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">would,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">could</hi> we?&#x2014; Sad remembrance of <hi rend="italic">another</hi> X<hi rend="italic">mas</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their mother&#x2019;s death, <date when="1853-12-25">25 Dec. 1853</date>; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531225-TC-JWC-01"><sic>28:349</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1853-12-25">25 Dec. 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note> present to me, also, at all moments. Which made a strange combination, peculiarly tragic when I had time to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it from the distance;&#x2014;like a man set to whittle cherrystones and toy boxes in the Valley of the Shadow of Death!&#x2014; Adieu dear Brother: my sheet is done. Write to me; give my love &#x26; regards that do not decay to the Friends you are among. T. Carlyle</p>
<p>Ruskin sent me two &#x201C;Lectures,&#x201C; delivered in Manchester:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Political Economy of Art: being the Substance (with Additions) of Two Lectures delivered at Manchester,</hi> <date when="1857-07-10"><hi rend="italic">July 10</hi></date> <hi rend="italic">and <date when="1857-07-13">13</date>,</hi> <date when="1857-00-00"><hi rend="italic">1857</hi></date>. Ruskin advocated increased public funding for the preservation of ancient buildings and the establishment of higher standards of public education in art and architecture. He blamed the recent commercial distress and unemployment on the &#x201C;let alone&#x201C; principle, and echoed <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> in his argument for greater government involvement in the economy: &#x201C;Do you at all recollect that interesting passage of Carlyle, in which he compares, in this country and at this day, the understood and commercial value of man and horse; and in which he wonders that the horse, with its inferior brains and its awkward hoofiness, instead of handiness, should be always worth so many tens or scores of pounds in the market, while the man, so far from always commanding his price in the market, would often be thought to confer a service on the community by simply killing himself out of their way? Well, Carlyle does not answer his own question, because he supposes we shall at once see the answer. The value of the horse consists simply in the fact of your being able to put a bridle on him. The value of the man consists precisely in the same thing. If you can bridle him, or, which is better, if he can bridle himself, he will be a valuable creature directly&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x2019;s Works</hi> 16:26, 28).</note> about &#x201C;encouraging the growth of art&#x201C; &#x26;c: not bad of their kind. Do you incline to spend a <hi rend="italic">groatsworth</hi> of stamp upon them?&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Here is a small Newyears remembrance of many years we have now passed in a brother-and-sisterly regard of one another; a favour of Heaven, I do acknowledge and believe, to both of us, so long as Heaven is pleased to continue it to us! May you have yet many years &#x201C;to see good&#x201C; in this world;&#x2014;or as poor Edward Irving was wont to put it, [&#x201C;]May the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of our years be past!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550106-TC-JAC-01"><sic>29:232</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1855-01-06">6 Jan. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> Some of them have been deep-ploughed with sorrow, of late: but in that too there may be a blessing; that too is the universal lot of man;&#x2014;and we must not complain.</p>
<p>I am holding on here; health still holding out; goal still a good way ahead of me,&#x2014;&#x201C;faint, yet pursuing.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Judg. 8:4.</note> As to health I really think it is, if anything, fundamentally <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than when you saw me last,&#x2014;thanks to the 2,000 miles or more I must have <hi rend="italic">ridden</hi> since, in pursuit of that object! Nothing can be more constant than I have been in that way; and at this season, in these cold desolate twilights, amid the roar of chaotic London and its environs, it is a kind of <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> to hold out in it.&#x2014; I have this day been setting about arrangements to send off my Horse for a couple of months into the Country,&#x2014;turn him loose, shoeless, and make me rid of him, till the days lengthen, especially <pb id="pg-33-143" n="33:143"/>till the slippery frosts go! My remembrance of last winter and its <hi rend="italic">glassy</hi> conveniences for the horseman in these parts, is so distressing, I cannot stand another bout of it, &#x26; am minded to walk till February or March.</p>
<p>The Book goes slowly, but it does not stick: if I can stand to it, there will come the <hi rend="italic">end.</hi> Jane is still moving about; but very frail; so ill off for <hi rend="italic">Sleep</hi> always,&#x2014;quite <hi rend="italic">missing,</hi> one night out of two or three; and <hi rend="italic">never</hi> getting the due quantity, not to speak of <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> at all.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton</salute>
<p>I suppose you were in Bath House transiently yesterday: I had called the day before about that Engraver and his Picture;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Holl, who was engraving <hi rend="italic">The Little Drummer</hi> for vol. 1, frontispiece, <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi></note> and heard you were coming. Some vague notion I had of a meeting with you <hi rend="italic">some</hi>how:&#x2014;but I took no definite steps; and one cannot expect good things to fall into one&#x2019;s mouth!&#x2014;The Engraver had been writing to me about plans for doing without the Picture after all, &#x201C;since I was so a[n]xious<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> and apprehensive&#x201C;; about getting new Photographs &#x26;c &#x26;c: I had answered that the clear method now was, to send for the Picture at once, since you had yielded the Permission,&#x2014;and, in fact, that I could not negociate or write any more on the subject. At the time I called, the Picture was still in Bath House: I hope our man did not call for it precisely in the time while you were there, and make a disturbance!&#x2014; &#x2014; I am terribly chaced about with Engravers, Map-makers, Printer&#x2019;s Devils, in addition to the <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> botheration from Prussian stupidity and the unweldable material I have got to hammer, this long while!</p>
<p>I ought to have said, with thanks, that we w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hold ourselves in readiness, and were good for a week at The Grange,&#x2014;any week you may judge suitablest. I try to believe I have got so far ahead of the Printer Disturbances, they cannot catch me for that time: at all events I will have that week of immunity from them,&#x2014;to spend it in the clear air, in the silence, amid many <pb id="pg-33-144" n="33:144"/>thoughts and recollections, of a sad yet perhaps salutary nature!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The death of Lady Ashburton.</note>&#x2014;My wife is very weak, but still afoot; the visit, if she take care of cold, may probably do her good.

<p>Last night, <hi rend="italic">night</hi> or late twilight, riding out at Hammersmith,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >London borough on the Thames, W of Chelsea.</note> the ground got suddenly <hi rend="italic">slippery</hi> (on the hard and frequented parts), and I perceived that there was virtual frost!

<salute>My dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I have been soothing my conscience, and, what is more to the purpose, my <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> by promising myself to write you a long, long letter, for your &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">first foot.</hi>&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On New Year&#x2019;s morning, <date when="1858-01-01">1 Jan.</date>, when she will receive JWC&#x2019;s letter.</note> and now I must restrict myself to a short one; my head being in such a state with want of sleep&#x2014;almost total&#x2014;for a week past&#x2014;that it is quite a severe labour for me to put my words into setences, and one that I had best not apply myself to. My cousins Maggie and Mary have been here about a fortnight&#x2014;and left last week&#x2014;and I have felt as if a whole troop of cavalry had ridden over me, and there wasn&#x2019;t a bit of my body whole! It is curious how two really well-disposed girls <hi rend="italic">could</hi> manage to so completely upset a household! But, upon my honour, habits of self indulgence and, confirmed thoughtlessness are more troublesome to others, I often think, than some <hi rend="italic">vices!</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C alone escaped &#x201C;consequences&#x201C;; for he hardy saw them for a few <pb id="pg-33-145" n="33:145"/>minuts in the day, and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> work, <hi rend="italic">his</hi> meals all that was <hi rend="italic">his</hi> was strictly gaurded from disturbance! But the <hi rend="italic">strain</hi> of constituting oneself a human partition-wall betwixt <hi rend="italic">work</hi> and trifling, takes more out of one than any one could believe till he tried! And so my sleep went! At an early stage of the business Ann&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">temper</hi> went&#x2014;tho&#x2019; she <hi rend="italic">had</hi> a regular <hi rend="italic">cook</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Newnham.</note> to help her; and it hasnt come back yet, her temper! the beautiful pair of new tortoise shell&#x2014;spectacles (!) I gave her on Xmas day hardly got thanks! I have a good mind to send you her photograph, that you may see exactly how she looks&#x2014;out of humour&#x2014;and pity me accordingly!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I do not understand quite how it is with Mary Welsh&#x2014; She adheres to her <hi rend="italic">invalid habits</hi> so far as they are pleasant to her&#x2014;breakfasts in bed&#x2014;gets up after midday&#x2014;is <hi rend="italic">dainty</hi> beyond any thing I ever saw in her eating&#x2014;keeps her bedroom constantly like a hot-house&#x2014;but no amount of amusement, of sight-seeing, of <hi rend="italic">dressing</hi> is too much for her! She staid out often till after dark&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">up to</hi> two or three different picture galleries in one day! Every time I went out with them I was fagged off my feet&#x2014; Clearly she had twice the strength I have&#x2014;who made a point of coming down to breakfast!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is not particularly applicable to a new years morning! God bless you my Darling&#x2014;and may the coming year console you over the past&#x2014;your grief cannot wear out<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Over the death of her father; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570324-JWC-MR-01"><sic>32:22</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1857-03-24">24</date> or <date when="1857-03-31">31 March</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;ever!&#x2014;with the warm heart you have&#x2014;but you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> get more strength to bear it, and <hi rend="italic">absorb</hi> it. My affectionate regards to your Husband I am sending him some photograph of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2014; &#x2014;and I am sending <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a little clasp for your cloak, of <hi rend="italic">the newest</hi> pattern. tho&#x2019;, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> wont signify to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> as it does to my cousins&#x2014;Mercy! that Auchtertool Manse shouldn&#x2019;t have stilled their enthusiasm for &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Miss Clark</hi>&#x201C; and fine clothes. Miss Clark is the same dressmaker and milliner (<hi rend="italic">their</hi> dressmaker &#x26; milliner <hi rend="italic">still</hi>&#x2014;while living at Auchtertool!) whose bill of <hi rend="italic">two thousand pounds for one year</hi>&#x2014;against some Lady figured the other day in the newspapers!

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>If you have quite done with that mass of Printed Sheets,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proofs of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> vols. 1 and 2.</note> will you tie a string about them; and, tomorrow or some day soon, I can, without dismounting (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> involves difficulties), get them from the servant, and make my horse bring them home. I sometimes need back-references &#x26;c; and have not a proper <hi rend="italic">succedaneum</hi> [remedy] in such cases.</p>
<p>I wish you with all my heart a &#x201C;happy New year,&#x201C; dear F.,&#x2014;as happy as this confused whirlpool of a world can yield it to a man! I am myself laboriously sprawling along in the valley of the shadow of Printer&#x2019;s Devils, and cannot expect to know &#x201C;happiness&#x201C; even by name: but things will alter in one&#x2019;s favour by and by.</p>

<salute>Dear Hunt,</salute>
<p>I received your kind Note; which was very welcome to me,&#x2014;the handwriting on the cover was like the knock of and<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> old Friend at the door. By a later post, the same day, the Magazine arrived; for which you must report me much obliged to Mr Moran.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt wrote, <date when="1857-12-31">31 Dec. 1857</date>, to introduce Benjamin Moran (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>), diplomat, writer, and private sec., <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>, to James Buchanan (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>) while he was minister to Gt. Britain. Moran was sending TC a copy of the new <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly,</hi> begun in <date when="1857-11-00">Nov. 1857</date>, &#x201C;which the post will bring you with this letter&#x201C;; he hoped to &#x201C;quash a fear which he retains of the terrible dictum which you once fulminated across the Atlantic respecting certain millions of &#x2018;bores,&#x2019;&#x201C; [in <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets, Works</hi> 20:21] and that &#x201C;he might be permitted to deprive you of half an hour of your time some morning.&#x201C;</note></p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>The 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> is Tuesday, tomorrow week: let that be the day, as you propose;&#x2014;Printers to be shoved over the horizon, till the Tuesday following that. I will bring my Horse; and hope to have some rides with you on those ever-<pb id="pg-33-148" n="33:148"/>memorable Downs,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >N and S Downs, two parallel ranges of chalk hills extending E from the middle of Hampshire (nr. The Grange) across Surrey, Kent, and Sussex.</note> where I have had so many. The Quadruped (not to speak of his rider) will be much obliged for his open paddock, and room to stretch his poor toes, lamed by the vile leather soles. Perhaps the fetlock joints too, as you once argued. Certainly the animal is nothing like so <hi rend="italic">light</hi> of foot, as some of yours I have ridden,&#x2014;going like antelopes, or as if their element were the air!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today it is bright, but very cold and windy; frost surely coming, one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think. Last ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> I rode by Richmond way; called on Bates,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joshua Bates (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490417-TC-RWE-01"><sic>24:26</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1849-04-17">17 April 1849</date></corr></ref>), American financier, philanthropist, and partner in Baring Bros., had a large country house at Sheen, nr. Richmond Park.</note> as I had promised that night we met in your room months ago. Bates professed to be slightly under the Doctor; but was brisk jolly and intelligent as usual. A substantial old blade; whom I always like to get hold of in talk. Mrs. also came in; exuberant as a sunflower, as a&#x2014;Almost too exuberant for me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lucretia Augusta, b. Sturgis, m. <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>. According to <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of American Biography,</hi> she was described as &#x201C;audaciously vulgar&#x201C; and &#x201C;born in a four-roomed log-house&#x201C;; Thomas Wren Ward (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), American agent of Baring Bros. and Bates&#x2019;s friend since childhood, wrote that Bates &#x201C;has a trial in his wife, as great as almost any person living&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Dictionary of American Biography</hi>).</note> The ride home was rapid, somewhat chaotic; darkness having fallen in the interim. London and all places were clangouring and jangling with their Sunday bells; a heaped-up universe of frosty fog, with flares of gaslight visible in it, hung on my right:&#x2014;a ride as thro&#x2019; a nightmare, tho&#x2019; an ugly fact withal.</p>

The <hi rend="italic">four stamps</hi> were superfluous,&#x2014;not intended to carry it <hi rend="italic">that</hi> way, but perhaps <hi rend="italic">this</hi> way in the course of months when you were quite tired of it. You may keep it about you now till there is (if ever) clearly a <hi rend="italic">franco</hi> [cost-free] opportunity of returning it; &#x26; that will make matters straight in that small particular.&#x2014; If you send the <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> to Jean, better rip out a handful of the advertisements, &#x26; save your twopence.</p>
<p>We have got frost at last with a witness! I have not felt such cold in weather for a long while as yesterday: hard as iron; grey and with a strong east wind too. Jane suffers nothing from it yet; let us hope she may get hardened: she is out walking when I went last down stairs;&#x2014;walk <hi rend="italic">vigorously</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> alas, she cannot do) under the due wrappages, it is pleasant enough winter weather,&#x2014;especially today when the wind is quite down. Yesterday you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have laughed to see me set out riding on the edge of dusk: I had resolved not to ride, so tempestuously cold was it; but when the horse came, and the roads were reported good, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not but try. I took my <hi rend="italic">cape</hi> buttoned to the neck; and under it&#x2014;an immense <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> brown dressing-gown I have (capable of passing for an old fashioned <hi rend="italic">topcoat,</hi> down to the heels): and in that guise, I took the <hi rend="italic">galloping</hi> all out of my horse (temperature supportable even in the wind), and brought him straight home again. Today I mean a <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> for him: and in a week hence, I hope to be rid of him altogether for 2 months,&#x2014;to go &#x201C;in a close paddock&#x201C; at The Grange till the days lengthen and the furious weather go. It is an absolute slavery to ride, at my hours, in this season of the year: and the horse&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">joints, toes</hi> &#x26;c, it is supposed may improve, not to speak of me &#x26; my finances at all.&#x2014; We go to The Grange, Jane &#x26; I tuesday next for one week (12<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x2014;19<hi rend="italic">th</hi> jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi>); a very melancholy visit,&#x2014;but not to be avoided with comfort either. Alas, alas!&#x2014; &#x2014; We are to be there then, thro&#x2019; the time I mention; I take my horse down with me; ride it while there, and so leave it till times mend for riding.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>This is a very elaborate, clever, and indeed poetical performance:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin was aware that TC might not approve of his &#x201C;speculative analysis&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 46) of <hi rend="italic">Sartor:</hi> &#x201C;The next time I called, Mrs Carlyle was very kind and sympathetic; and full of admiration for what she called my &#x2018;little poem,&#x2019; which she said I &#x2018;really ought to publish.&#x2019; Twenty years afterwards I acted on her advice&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 47); pbd. in <hi rend="italic">Carlyle and the Open Secret of His Life</hi> (<date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>) 11&#x2013;58. Larkin believed that <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> reflected TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;secret longing &#x2026; for human sympathy and communion of thought and deed,&#x201C; and that through his protagonist Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh he had expressed his hidden ambition to gather &#x201C;around him a few kindred spirits, to co-operate with him in something better and more practical than mere book-writing&#x201C; (56&#x2013;58).</note> but I fear it will not do for a &#x201C;Summary,&#x201C; or mere Invoice of Contents; to the common run of reader it would not be intelligible; and it is far too long!&#x2014; &#x2014; I grieve much for the immense trouble you have taken with it: however, it will not be lost trouble, all of it, either. Meanwhile the question is what can be done?</p>
<p>Lushington sent you <hi rend="small-caps">a</hi> <hi rend="italic">Summary;</hi> giving at least the facts of the Book. On the spur of the moment you could not do much to mend it, but perhaps you might a little,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">shorter</hi> the better, always;&#x2014;and I suppose it will be our best plan now to take that <hi rend="italic">tale quale</hi> [for what it is worth].</p>
<p>Make Robson throw off a few Copies of this Proof wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I now have, and we will keep it <hi rend="italic">in memoriam.</hi> And be patient with me, and with your fate!&#x2014; I am here always till half past 3.</p>

<p>Very soon, either at once or successively, you will receive from the Printer, in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Slips,</hi>&#x201C; the whole of that detestable <hi rend="italic">Grumkow-Nosti</hi> stuff<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Wilhelm von Grumkow (<date when="1678-00-00">1678</date>&#x2013;<date when="1739-00-00">1739</date>), confidant and military advisor to Friedrich Wilhelm, member of the &#x201C;Tobacco Parliament,&#x201C; who secretly worked for Austria to thwart the &#x201C;double-marriage&#x201C; plan (supported by Queen Sophie Dorothee), the purpose of which was to unite the houses of Brandenburg and Hanover. He employed Reichenbach (&#x201C;Nosti&#x201C;), the Prussian resident in London, to spy on the English court and to misrepresent its intentions to Friedrich Wilhelm; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:210&#x2013;71; see also <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570429-TC-JN-01"><sic>32:136</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1857-04-29">29 April 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> in its immediately <hi rend="italic">ante-final</hi> state;&#x2014;upon wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have just (sorrow on it once more!) spent <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> miserable days, endeavouring to force some human distinctness into it! I want you to read it over, as with <hi rend="italic">armed eyesight,</hi> and see whether you find anything to rectify in it. I have been looking, as it were, with <hi rend="italic">your</hi> eyes, all along; and may have missed in one point or the other. The <hi rend="italic">references</hi> (foot-note references) especially I request you to watch narrowly. In such an abominable bucket of liquid mud, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has no shape of its own, one ought to be particularly strict and distinct in giving the <hi rend="italic">mechanical outline</hi> it is put into,&#x2014;the shape of the <hi rend="italic">bucket,</hi> I might call it! If you find anything wrong or <hi rend="italic">uncertain</hi> in regard to <hi rend="italic">where</hi> the Pieces are described as now <hi rend="italic">being,</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c, I pray you mark it for me.&#x2014; You will need your <hi rend="italic">Abstract from the Paper Office</hi> very particularly; and I have left it out for you <hi rend="italic">here</hi> (Garret room; top of the little &#x201C;Pedestal Chest-of-drawers,&#x201C; left side of the fireplace; there you will find the <hi rend="italic">Ms. Abstract,</hi> and can take it home with you,&#x2014;carefully restoring it by and by).</p>
<p>I am going off to The Grange tomorrow (Saturday) till perhaps Wednesday: not before that day I think can your survey have been completed; after hearing you (or rather reading you, what you may have put upon the &#x201C;Slips&#x201C; sent), I will send them <hi rend="italic">to Press,</hi>&#x2014;in the sure hope of having done with them forever and a day more!&#x2014; It is not likely to be much later than Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> when I get back: next Sunday, to tea, we will expect you in person</p>
<p>We were to have gone to The Grange on Tuesday last; but my poor Wife took cold; and after some hithering and thithering, it comes to this, that I am to go by myself; and leave her here, still poorly tho&#x2019; a little better.

<p>I am glad to hear of your being rapidly under way again. There is no remedy for <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets;</hi> the volume must just stand of the stature it is;&#x2014;probably the readers will find they have got provocation enough for their money.</p>
<p>I am going into Hampshire tomorrow (Saturday)&#x2014;till probably Wednesday next. Do not call on Tuesday therefore with the &#x201C;C&#xfc;strin&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Or K&#xfc;strin, N of Frankfurt-am-Oder, about 65 mi. E of Berlin, where Frederick&#x2019;s father had him imprisoned; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:326.</note> let it be Thursday, please. But my Wife wants you to call on <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> on Monday, or the first day you have; some money she wants you to pay for her at Coutts&#x2018;s Bank in the Strand.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Journey to the Reich</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Book 7, chap. 5; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:271&#x2013;88. Frederick planned to escape to France with the help of his friends, Lt. Katte and Lt. Keith; Keith&#x2019;s brother, a page, revealed the plot to Friedrich Wilhelm; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:305.</note> is, more than half of it, in type: if you have the Map ready, you might as well bring it here to lie by me while the Proofs are getting corrected. There was one passage about the <hi rend="italic">Pleisse</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Elster,</hi> &#x201C;up the Pleisse and then across the Elster,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rivers (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:275); the Pleisse flows N through Altenburg to Leipzig, and the Elster is a tributary of the Saale between Leipzig and Halle. For the map of &#x201C;Journey to the Reich,&#x201C; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:opp. 312.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I could not understand completely (not having any <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Map), and was afraid might be wrong. You will now, however, have a complete opportunity of <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> and re-reading the thing; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> perhaps may profit the Map in some point or other. I forget if the <hi rend="italic">track</hi> of the Journey was <hi rend="italic">indicated</hi> by some dotted line (&#x2014; &#x2014; &#x2014; &#x2014;), or otherwise? Nor do I know whether it can conveniently be done if not. In any case, the Map will be of essential service to every <hi rend="italic">good</hi> reader,&#x2014;and no bad or careless one will get the least hurt from it.</p>
<p>On Monday, then, or as soon as you pass this way,&#x2014;for the Coutts Bank concern. Thursday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (or so soon after as you are ready) for the &#x201C;C&#xfc;strin&#x201C; and me.</p>

When the day came, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had to write that not only I was unable to come but that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could not leave me! In vain I urged on him that as he had left me often before ill, to go to that same place, his declining to go now would give the idea that either I was &#x201C;waited on for death&#x201C; or that I was grown strangely exacting. The truth came out at last; &#x201C;he had no will to go, and <hi rend="italic">was very glad of the pretext</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014; But a note from Lord A showing plainly <hi rend="italic">he</hi> did not believe in my illness&#x2014;at least as a reason for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s not coming and some other reasons have decided him to go later&#x2014;and I do not expect him back till the middle or end of next week. Meanwhile Ann seems to have &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">had a devil</hi>&#x2019; ever since the advent of those unlucky girls;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maggie and Mary Welsh, for their visit in <date when="1857-12-00">Dec. 1857</date>.</note> and my illness instead of softening her heart (if she have one) has given her only greater opportunity to show her devilishness at my expense. It would be <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> to go into thinking how indulgent I have been to that woman; how &#x201C;ungrateful&#x201C; she has been to me &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c, and work <pb id="pg-33-154" n="33:154"/>myself into a rage, and <hi rend="italic">give her warning,</hi> and&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">pay the Piper</hi>&#x201C;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> But that reflection of having the Piper <hi rend="italic">to pay</hi> keeps me quiet&#x2014;outwardly&#x2014;for inwardly, I own to plenty of smothered wrath. Look at the case&#x2014;it is the dead of <hi rend="italic">winter,</hi> when a revolution in a house cannot be accomplished without difficulty and discomfort, <hi rend="italic">at the best</hi>&#x2014;and then I have had enough sad experience of servants, to hope little from changing any one of them <hi rend="italic">that can be gone on with</hi> better or worse. One may find a momentary relief from changing one sort of faults for another sort, but these get just as worrying in their turn&#x2014;and the servant <hi rend="italic">without</hi> faults&#x2014;even without grave ones&#x2014;where is she&#x2014;to be got for her weight in gold? The question here however comes to be, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> Ann <hi rend="italic">be gone on with;</hi> and I rather think <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> because she is ceasing to be <hi rend="italic">servant</hi> of the house, and aspiring to the r&#xF4;le of absolute mistress, which I do not yet incline to abdicate. I may and ought to put up with want of &#x201C;kindness,&#x201C; &#x201C;pleasantness&#x201C; even &#x201C;obligingness&#x201C;&#x2014;in favour of the requisite qualifications, and the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">unexceptionable character</hi>&#x201C; one gives so much a-year for! but I <hi rend="italic">must not</hi> live <hi rend="italic">in fear</hi> of asserting my authority in my own house; for fear of illtemper culminating in &#x201C;giving warning.&#x201C; This is what it was coming to between us; the sad consciousness of my helplessness in winter, (since I am become so susceptible to cold) making me <hi rend="italic">ignore</hi> not only her humours but her selfwill, till I was seized with disgust at my cowardice and suddenly pulled her down on her haunches (I mean <hi rend="italic">figuratively</hi> of course) (That was on newyears day! the better day the better deed!)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Middleton, <hi rend="italic">The Phoenix</hi> 3.1.</note> Since then she has been <hi rend="italic">polite</hi> and does what she is bid&#x2014;but there is something <hi rend="italic">systematic, poisonous</hi> in her docility&#x2014;which gives me the idea that she has some end to serve&#x2014;other than that of mending her ways! Probably, being a woman of <hi rend="italic">sense,</hi> she has considered that a new place in the dead of winter is no more desirable for <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> than a new servant is for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;and that it will be best to do things <hi rend="italic">securely</hi>&#x2014;find a more promising &#x201C;new love&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">before</hi> she is &#x201C;off with the old.&#x201C;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the proverbial &#x201C;Off with the old, on with the new.&#x201C;</note> But anyhow I cannot build any <hi rend="italic">prospect</hi> of comfort on her present <hi rend="italic">vindictive</hi> countenance, and <hi rend="italic">douceureuse</hi> [sugary] manner. So my purpose is, to meet <hi rend="italic">smooth with smooth,</hi> and postpone the <hi rend="italic">denoument</hi> till I have more strength to hunt up a new servant, and train her, than at present; confined as I am to my two rooms!</p>
<p>If I had only <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> to think for, I fear the natural woman would rise up in me and explode; at all costs and risks. But M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is so dreadfully put about by the least change around him, and Ann&#x2019;s quiet methodical ways suit him perfectly&#x2014;while he sees nothing below the surface, and don&#x2019;t care a straw whether she be made of flesh and blood or of sulphur and brimstone! What a frightfully long chapter on a Servant! But you will excuse it if it relieve my <pb id="pg-33-155" n="33:155"/>mind putting on paper what, for the rest, I keep entirely to myself. I have not even Geraldine to tell. Geraldine is all but as good as gone out of my life!!!&#x2014; She went into Essex the day before I returned from Scotland<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570911-JWC-GEJ-01">JWC to GEJ, [<date when="1857-09-11">11? Sept. 1857</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; Thence after two months she went to Manchester<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit her brothers, particularly Frank.</note>&#x2014;seeing me for just half an hour in passing thro London and is not yet returned&#x2014; So except for that one glimpse I have not seen her since I left for Scotland in the beginning of July&#x2014; Latterly she has quite ceased to write to me!!!&#x2014; She has been making &#x201C;a considerable of a fool&#x201C; of herself; to speak plainly. and has got estranged from me utterly <hi rend="italic">for the time being;</hi> partly because her head has been pack-full of nonsense, and partly because I made no secret of that opinion. You have several times asked about her, and I always forgot to tell you&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">or</hi> it was too unpleasant to tell. Geraldine has one besetting weakness. She is never happy unless she has a <hi rend="italic">grand passion</hi> on hand&#x2014;and as unmarried men take fright at her impulsive demonstrative ways; her <hi rend="italic">grand passions</hi> for these <hi rend="italic">thirty years</hi> have been all expended on <hi rend="italic">married</hi> men&#x2014;who <hi rend="italic">felt themselves safe.</hi>&#x2014; And she too always went quite safe thro these romantic affairs&#x2014; meaning really nothing but whirlwinds of <hi rend="italic">Sentiment,</hi> and the men too somehow meaning as little&#x2014;or less! But when I was in Scotland&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">you</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC visited Mary Russell, 22&#x2013;29 <date when="1856-09-00">Sept. 1856</date>; see vol. 31.</note>&#x2014;she made an intimacy with a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Mantle who had been ten years in Australia,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Mantell had been in New Zealand.</note> unhappily <hi rend="italic">not</hi> married, only <hi rend="italic">engaged</hi> or &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">as good as engaged</hi>&#x201C; to a young cousin of his own<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Undentified.</note>&#x2014; For a long time it was an intimacy &#x201C;with the reciprocity all on one side&#x201C; But she went on writing him letters, inviting him to her house, flattering him, consoling him (he is a proud shy man) doing him all sorts of kindnesses; till he declared to his friends &#x201C;he couldnt help liking Miss Jewsbury she was so extraordinary kind to him.&#x201C; &#x2014;He relied I suppose on his being some ten or twelve years younger than herself<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mantell was eight years younger than Jewsbury.</note> for security in accepting her kindness.</p>
<p>I could not see her committing herself as she did, and hear all her acquaintance chattering about her &#x201C;assiduites&#x201C; for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Mantle, without testifying my displeasure, and in proportion as she attached herself to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> she drew away from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> got pettish, suspicious, and mysterious.

But all that makes me so angry, and what is worse disgusts me!

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>There were two points I forgot to specify with the due distinctness in regard to the Grumkow-Nosti, and indeed one of them refers to our State-Paper <hi rend="italic">Abstract</hi> generally;&#x2014;namely the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of the two,</p>
<p><pb id="pg-33-157" n="33:157"/>1<hi rend="italic">&#xB0;</hi>.

<p>Most of the <hi rend="italic">Gr</hi>w <hi rend="italic">Nosti Pieces</hi> are given without special reference; nor is such needed farther: but we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be accurately certain as to the general locality of them;&#x2014;pray examine also if I am right in my notion as to the manner of their having <hi rend="italic">got</hi> into the State P.O., wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I try to indicate in a footnote on one occasion.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:225.</note>&#x2014; On the whole I can only ask you to look once again (for the last time) with your best eyesight upon that sad matter; and do for it what human method and intelligence can, now on its first stepping forth from Chaos into Cosmos.</p>
<p>I arrived here, safe, riding on my Horse who had come in the railway with me, yesterday late in the afternoon.

<dateline>The Grange Sunday / <date when="1858-01-17">17 jan<hi rend="italic">y,</hi> 1858</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My dear little Goody,</salute>
<p>I would give something to know how you are this bright Sunday; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> to you will not be so bright as it is here;&#x2014;whether you slept last night; what you are doing &#x26;c &#x26;c? I shall have to wait till Tuesday morning: there is no chance for me sooner.</p>
<p>The train did not go yesterday (nor <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> to go!) till <hi rend="italic">one</hi> o&#x2019;clock. This involved me in 50 minutes waiting; and in other vile <hi rend="italic">burbles</hi> about getting the Horse put in &#x26;c &#x26;c, the whole of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> however were happily got over without damage done. Horse was dreadfully afraid at getting into his box; could hardly believe his eyes for joy when he found himself on land again, and old <hi rend="italic">Masta</hi>&#x2019; with the broadbrim patting his nose, and just about to mount him as usual. I rode slowly along thro&#x2019; the silent woods,&#x2014;all the world very <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> trim and beautiful in these parts;&#x2014;there was a dogcart at the Station wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> took my luggage in hand.&#x2014; Lord A. soon joined me in this big vacant room; and talked cheerfully for a long while: after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I retired to smoke. He had a crutch last night, but had been riding &#x26;c: today he is considerably worse; has <hi rend="italic">two</hi> crutches, and is quite past riding:&#x2014;a sad enough case here.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton was suffering from gout.</note> Lady Sandwich &#x26; Miss Baring did not appear till dinner,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was held in the <hi rend="italic">Study</hi>-room (Lord A.&#x2019;s old place, if you recollect it) and was not so miserable as you might have expected,&#x2014;indeed was very prettily managed under the inexorable circumstances. Poor old Lady S. was almost pathetic in her little politenesses and gaieties; and enough to make one sad to the heart. The younger Lady is <hi rend="italic">crackly,</hi> tries to lead the talk &#x26;c; and is as civil all round as she can be. Rous<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. James Rouse.</note> fat contented and partially stolid as heretofore.</p>
<p>I am lodged in a <hi rend="italic">ground</hi> room, this time, lefthand side of the front <hi rend="italic">door</hi> (if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> look <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the door),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For The Grange, see 30:frontispiece; for its front elevation, see <sic>opp</sic><corr>above</corr>.</note> where I have seen Thackeray &#x26;c lodged: it has the convenience that I can shove up the window whenever I like, and walk out to smoke: the <hi rend="italic">fires</hi> &#x26;c wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> burn all day w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> suit you much better than me: I did not sleep <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than my worst last night;&#x2014;but the walk in the sunny calm of the morning up and down these environs was beautiful and mournful to me. Lady S. sent all manner of inquiries after my poor Jeanny: I must try <pb id="pg-33-159" n="33:159"/>if I can find where the good old Lady is, &#x26; try to pay her a visit, for I think she never appears down stairs till dinner. You would have done very well here for temperature &#x26;c &#x26;c could you have escaped that <hi rend="italic">arrest</hi> for a half week longer. <figure><graphic url="volume-33-159-09.gif"/><p>Front elevation of The Grange, 2002</p><p><hi rend="italic">Courtesy of Sheila McIntosh</hi></p></figure></p>
<p>Who they are that come next week I have not yet fully ascertained: Old Bear,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Ellice.</note> I think, is the first of them, and he not till <hi rend="italic">Wednesday.</hi> I shall not be in the way I take it, and ought, I conclude, to hold out till then. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> have a chance to hear again before I can have a word of you. Oh take care of yourself my poor little woman; get something to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> above all! My Blessings ever on you. <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p>Nothing at all to say, my dear little Goody, if it be not to thank you for your good little Note of this morning; and to announce that I am to be home tomorrow (Wednesday) according to program, if nothing sinister present. What <hi rend="italic">hour</hi> I come at is not to be specified at this moment; for tho&#x2019; I inquired I did not learn: the only fixed thing is L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A. is to drive over with me himself; and I conclude it will be the soonest handy hour after about 11 or Noon (at which latter hour he seems mostly to go out): so that (if all have gone well) it will probably be somewhere <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> 4 p.m,&#x2014;before or after,&#x2014;when I come in upon poor Nero and you again.</p>
<p>Your accounts of <hi rend="italic">neither</hi> of these individualities are cheering: of your own poor allowance of sleep, I learn nothing except the ominous fact of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">frequent</hi> lucifers,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To check on Nero; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580118-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-01-18">18 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;my poor little suffering woman! But I shall see with my eyes in the course of not many hours farther.</p>
<p>Today I have walked less; but I have been in the air all along almost; drove with the lame Host (who is really very good company in the silent lanes in a <pb id="pg-33-164" n="33:164"/>swift open vehicle); and few minutes ago, I returned from a ride which probably the Horse tho<hi rend="italic">t long.</hi> I am thoroughly stupified and tired by it; and have a notion to put on a dressing-gown, and tumble into bed here. For dinner is at the easy hour of eight: a bit of bread and butter I have to eat at lunch falls heavy on me in the long afternoon. I write in my own room tonight; they announce tea: but it is uncertain whether I will go.</p>
<p>I delivered both your messages almost in your own words; and both were handsomely received. I have never <hi rend="italic">opened</hi> the Proofs I know what <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are; need to see Neuberg before they can be <hi rend="italic">finished,</hi>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">scunner</hi> at beginning them in the present mood and element. Oh my poor little Goody, get <hi rend="italic">better,</hi> were it never so little! Better or worse it is a great blessing to get home to thee again. <closer><salute>Blessings ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir</salute>
<p>I have to thank you for a surprise, a pleasure, and a&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">consolation</hi> (!) all in one Book!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Scenes of Clerical Life,</hi> 2 vols. (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>). Eliot recorded in her journal, <date when="1858-01-08">8 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I ordered copies to be sent to the following persons&#x2014;Froude, Dickens, Thackeray, Tennyson, Ruskin, Faraday &#x2026; Mrs. Carlyle&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">The Journals of George Eliot,</hi> ed. Margaret Harris and Judith Johnson [Cambridge, <date when="1998-00-00">1998</date>] 292).</note> and I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> thank you most sincerely. I cannot divine what inspired the good thought to send <hi rend="italic">me</hi> your Book; since (if the name on the Title Page be your real name) it could not have been personal regard; there has never been a <hi rend="italic">George Eliot</hi> among my friends or acquaintances. But neither I am sure could <hi rend="italic">you</hi> divine the circumstance under which I should read the Book, and the particular benefit it should confer on me!&#x2014; I read it&#x2014;at least the first volume&#x2014;during one of the most (physically) wretched nights of my life; sitting up in bed, unable to get a wink of sleep for fever and sorethroat; and it helped me thro that dreary night, as well&#x2014;better than the most sympathetic helpful friend watching by my bedside could have done!</p>
<p>You will believe that the book needed to be something more than a &#x201C;new <pb id="pg-33-165" n="33:165"/>novel&#x201C; for me; that I <hi rend="italic">could,</hi> at my years, and after so much reading, read it in positive torment, and be beguiled by it of the torment! that it needed to be the one sort of Book, however named, that still takes hold of me, and that grows rarer every year&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">human</hi> book&#x2014;written out of the heart of a live man, not merely out of the brain of an author&#x2014;full of tenderness and pathos without a scrap of sentimentality, of sense without dogmatism, of earnestness without twaddle&#x2014;a book that makes one <hi rend="italic">feel friends,</hi> at once and for always, with the man or woman who wrote it!</p>
<p>In guessing at why you gave me this good gift; I have thought amongst other things; &#x201C;Oh, perhaps it was a delicate way of presenting the <hi rend="italic">novel</hi> to my Husband, he being over head and ears in <hi rend="italic">History.</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; If that was it; I compliment you on your <hi rend="italic">tact!</hi> for my Husband is much liklier to read the <hi rend="italic">Scenes</hi> on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> responsibility than on a venture of his own&#x2014; Tho&#x2019;, as a general rule, never opening a novel, he has engaged to read this one, whenever he has some leisure from his present Task.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >3. Eliot wrote, <date when="1858-01-26">26 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;came a very pleasant letter from Mrs. Carlyle, thanking the author of Clerical Scenes for the present of his book, praising it very highly, and saying that her husband had promised to read it when released from his mountain of history&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Journals</hi> 294).</note></p>
<p>A severe Influenza, which fell on me the same day I had the windfall of the book, and from which I am but just <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> to recover, must excuse the tardiness of my acknowledgments.</p>
<p>I hope to know someday if the person I am addressing bears any resemblance, in external things to the Idea I have conceived of him in my mind&#x2014;a man of middle age&#x2014;with a wife from whom he has got those beautiful <hi rend="italic">feminine</hi> touches in his book&#x2014;a good many children&#x2014;and a dog&#x2014;that he has as much fondness for as I have for my little Nero! for the rest&#x2014;not just a Clergyman; but Brother or first cousin to a Clergyman!&#x2014; How ridiculous all this <hi rend="italic">may</hi> read, beside the reality!</p>
<p>Any how; I honestly confess I am very curious about you&#x2014;and look forward with what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle would call &#x201C;a good, healthy, genuine desire&#x201C; to shaking hands with you someday&#x2014; In the meanwhile I remain your obliged</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your second little Note this morning; and will begin the day with sending you the &#x201C;two words&#x201C; you are brotherly enough to long for. I went to <pb id="pg-33-166" n="33:166"/>the Grange after all, for three days, with my Horse,&#x2014;with him, but returned without him:&#x2014;I got your Note there on Saturday night (the House by that time all empty of foreign persons);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; possibly guests for the royal wedding on <date when="1858-01-25">25 Jan.</date>; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580128-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1858-01-28">28 Jan.</date></ref></note> I intended to answer; and actually had pen in hand, one night; but found obstructions interruptions, and so it was not done. Returning on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last, I found such a cartload of <hi rend="italic">Fried</hi>h confusions accumulated in my absence (in particular, I think about 90 pages of <hi rend="italic">proofs</hi>), and so many things to settle, that I have not had a moment to myself, nor am likely to have for a couple of days yet or more. Happily my poor Jane is somewhat better; she had a little improved on Friday and Saturday,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> made her urge the shocking unpoliteness of breaking an express promise, and despatch <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at the eleventh hour She professed to be still farther improved when I came home; and in fact does sleep perceptibly better (tho&#x2019; still very ill) and eat also a little better;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; her cough, I perceive, is rather worse than before: and in fact she is weak and heavy-laden to a degree, and nothing but an invincible spirit could keep her up at all.</p>
<p>It was the first day of the <hi rend="italic">thaw</hi> when she <hi rend="italic">discovered</hi> her cold; but I doubt not it had been getting ready in the cold days before;&#x2014;indeed there were some wretched operatives here, busy upon the <hi rend="italic">grate,</hi> and its back and its tiles, down below, with whom she had a great deal of trouble and vexation; <hi rend="italic">they,</hi> I think, had mainly done it.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I got home very quietly that Afternoon; found my wife a little improved,&#x2014;sleeping rather better &#x26;c, tho&#x2019; still coughing a good deal;&#x2014;and such a lot of Printer incumbrances, for quantity and quality, as I hard[ly]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> recollect before! Nothing was done upon them that night;&#x2014;nothing till after your Letter of next morning, and other breakfast phenomena, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was highly welcome at its Address, and is to be answered, I hear, in some happy moment the first that comes.&#x2014;I sat all day, struggling with multiplex chaos in its least dignified form; and was well nigh stupefied to extinction before I got loose from it close on dusk. One welcome circumstance, whether a quite wholesome one or not, was, that I had not then to go out riding in the fierce east-wind and inhospitable dark.</p>
<p>I suppose Lord &#x26; Lady Sandwich are gone by this time: I presume to like his L<hi rend="italic">p</hi> very well;&#x2014;pray tell <hi rend="italic">Mamma</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dowager Lady Sandwich.</note> that small fact, if it can be of the least use to her: and at all events, do not forget to explain my French leave-taking;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., leaving without saying goodbye.</note> and how it was produced by the invincible force of circumstances. If Mr Ellice is with you, I will also beg to be recommended to him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Orsini,</hi>&#x201C; it appears, is a man who used to be about Mazzini in former years; understood to be a man of high rank in his own country;&#x2014;had to go about <hi rend="italic">armed,</hi> at one time, here; certain Italians (I think, of the Pickpocket or Begging-Letter species) having tried to &#x201C;assassinate&#x201C; him on the streets one night. The reddest-hot radicals, who like the so-called Emperor worst, are disgusted utterly with this reckless piece of murder and mischief; and I think will vote generally that hanging is the suitable response to it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Felice Orsini (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>), member of Mazzini&#x2019;s Young Italy since <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; deputy to the Roman republic, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>. He respected Mazzini but believed that the triumvirate that headed the republican govt. in Rome, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date> (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490517-JWC-JW-01"><sic>24:52</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1849-05-17">17 May 1849</date></corr></ref>), needed men of action. Active in various conspiracies and rebellions and imprisoned several times, Orsini described his escape from San Georgio prison, Mantua, <date when="1856-03-30">30 March 1856</date>, in two popular works, <hi rend="italic">The Austrian Dungeons in Italy</hi> (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Memoirs and Adventures</hi> (<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), which brought him international acclaim and public lecturing contracts in England. After a rift between him and Mazzini, Orsini insulted Mazzini&#x2019;s English friends, Emilie Hawkes (also JWC&#x2019;s friend) and her brother-in-law, James Stansfeld (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1898-00-00">98</date>), future M.P. and women&#x2019;s rights advocate. Orsini challenged Stansfeld to a duel in <date when="1856-10-00">Oct. 1856</date>. When asked by Mazzini to withdraw the challenge, he refused, and Mazzini reported the duel to the Italian Society (see J. L. and Barbara Hammond, <hi rend="italic">James Stansfeld</hi> [<date when="1932-00-00">1932</date>] 34). Orsini became increasingly isolated because he wanted a more violent program for revolutionary change than Mazzini and his followers. His contact with like-minded Italian and English revolutionaries resulted in a plot to assassinate Napoleon III and the empress Eug&#xE9;nie. On <date when="1858-01-14">14 Jan.</date>, outside the Opera House, rue Lepelletier, Paris, Orsini and four accomplices attacked with grenades and pistols. The emperor and empress escaped, but eight people were killed and 156 wounded. The rebels were captured, and Orsini and Giuseppe Pieri (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>), a fellow conspirator, were guillotined, <date when="1858-03-13">13 March</date>.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read your &#x201C;bit of Annandale Produce,&#x201C;&#x2014;your prose part of it wholly, for the first time, and a good many of poor Johnstone&#x2019;s rhymed Pieces for the second;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Johnstone, <hi rend="italic">Poems on Various Subjects</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), a new edn., with additional poems and a memoir of the author by William Johnstone; originally pbd. as <hi rend="italic">Poems on Various Subjects, but Chiefly Illustrative of the Manners and Superstitions of Annandale</hi> (Dumfries, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>; repbd. <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>). John Johnstone (<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), shoemaker of Craighouse of Corrie. The advertisement at the start of the <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> edn. notes that the profits were to &#x201C;be devoted to the benefit of his only surviving son, and youngest child, who, from weakness and infirmity, is wholly dependant on the kindness of others.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;and have to give you thanks for a really interesting hour or two you have procured me.</p>
<p>I remember the good old Shoemaker very well; and had always been taught to esteem him as a man of honest piety, sense and worth, before I saw any of his writings. Our one little interview I recollect very well, too;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to William Johnstone&#x2019;s introduction, John Johnstone was visited by Edward Irving, among other Dumfriesshire names known to TC, and &#x201C;even the eminent writer, Mr. Thomas Carlyle, did not decline spending a few hours of familiar friendly conversation with the venerable rustic Bard&#x201C;; he also had &#x201C;a warm and congenial friend in Mr. [William] Graham of Burnswark&#x201C; (xl).</note> and the figure of the old man is pleasant to me at this moment,&#x2014;the Favish,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> or whoever it was that moved us on the occasion, has entirely vanished. I read Johnstone&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> afterwards; which increased my kind feeling towards him. An excellent Brother-mortal was clearly evident there; struggling under manifold impediments, and making an honourable shift among them,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">victorious</hi> intrinsically as few are.</p>
<p>You seem to me to have done a pious service in recording such a Life, such a scene of human things, mute otherwise; and to have done it with real merit, in a faithful, loving and genial manner.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his introduction to John Johnstone&#x2019;s poems.</note> I can well fancy (in spite of the <hi rend="italic">misprints</hi>)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date> William Johnstone told TC that the <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> edn. of John Johnstone&#x2019;s poems had been printed &#x201C;by some novice in the craft &#x26; was very much disfigured by errors of the press.&#x201C; As the book was well received, Johnstone decided to republish it &#x201C;correctly&#x201C; and with some additions &#x201C;to extend the notice of the old poet or rather of Corrie &#x26; its former inhabitants&#x201C; (NLS: Acc. 10915/10).

<p>Oh my dear, dear Lady Kinloch! How happy you have made me! Of all the Surprises that could have been contrived, I do call <hi rend="italic">this</hi> the most charming! Views of my <hi rend="italic">Home,</hi> coming from <hi rend="italic">you!</hi> you, forever identified in my mind with dear old Long Ago, and so long vanished out of my actual Life! <figure><graphic url="volume-33-172-11.gif"/><p>Jane Welsh Carlyle to Lady Kinloch, [27 January 1858]</p><p><hi rend="italic">Courtesy of the National Library of Scotland</hi></p></figure></p>
<p>I have been <hi rend="italic">crying,</hi> these ten minutes like a little Girl; the heart of me made all soft and young, <hi rend="italic">for the moment,</hi> at sight of those views accompanied with that name! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Kinloch</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014;God bless me! How many echoes it awakes in my heart! What beautiful scenes it recalls!&#x2014; But better to have rushed off at once to you, and kissed your hands for my present, rather than to be <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> thanks for which I cannot find good enough words. Decidedly&#x2014;if I <hi rend="italic">could rush</hi> or even walk! but for more than a fortnight I have been tied hand and foot, as it were, by Influenza,&#x2014;obliged to pass my time betwixt my Bed and my Sofa. And the worst is, I don&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> like getting about all thro the winter&#x2014;</p>
<p>Will you kindly let me know when you return to Town&#x2014;and will you put <pb id="pg-33-172" n="33:172"/><pb id="pg-33-173" n="33:173"/>Lady Thomas Hay<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Kinloch&#x2019;s da., Harriet (d. <date when="1891-00-00">1891</date>), m., <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, Lord Thomas Hay (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">1890</date>), rector of Rendlesham, Suffolk, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>.</note> in mind of her little old admirer Jeanie Welsh, and will you believe me ever affectionately and gratefully yours</p>

    <salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
    <p>We have frosty weather here, but the gentlest kind of frost for most part,&#x02014;windless, with a good deal of sun ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> midday; nothing but the cold <hi rend="italic">fog</hi> to be complained of;&#x02014;so that my poor Patient does not <hi rend="italic">relapse,</hi> but on the contrary goes on with some signs of improvement, in the matter of eating and of sleeping a perceptible improvement; and is, in short, as well as I could expect, in consistency with never getting into fresh air at all.</p>
    <p>For my own share, I take very long walks, for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> there is traceable a <hi rend="italic">better</hi> capacity (better clearly but not greatly) than there used to be quite <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the time of the Horse. But I have no right heart left, after all, and am sad and feckless,&#x02014;still hanging to my sorrowful enterprise, but in no case to domineer over it, and drive it before me. One gets such a load of reminiscences withal, and dwells so much with the Departed, a solitary creature among the Living, at this stage of one&#x02019;s pilgrimage! I long much to be out of those trifling rubbishes of &#x0201C;History&#x0201D; so-called; and either to do nothing, or something of a piece with my own frame of mind. Nothing here to spur me on, except merely the reluctance to be foiled in one&#x02019;s job of work.&#x02014; Done with it, Done with it! that is the only recipe or remedy.&#x02014;</p>
    <p>I did apply to Farie about J. Aitken<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">James Aitken, Jean&#x02019;s son, had been working in Glasgow but was now looking for other employment; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571102-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1857-11-02">2 Nov. 1857</date>

He seems to think, <hi rend="italic">Glasgow</hi> might have done as well for a young fellow, if well sought into. You may tell Jean of this Farie <hi rend="italic">reply</hi> (she knows of the rest) if there be ready opportunity.</p>
    <p>Tait is still painting away at that interminable &#x0201C;interior&#x0201D;; but happily he now does it at his own house; and gives no bother <hi rend="italic">here</hi> for many weeks past.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Thanks again for your ever-prompt services! I believe the Abstract will be of real use,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580126-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1858-01-26">26 Jan.</date></ref></note> and mainly help me over that ugly <hi rend="italic">stile.</hi> But the first thing is, you must bring or send me back the Preuss volume,&#x2014;for except of <hi rend="italic">Voltaire&#x2019;s</hi> Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably one of Voltaire&#x2019;s letters to Frederick in J.

Tomorrow, or day after will do very well,&#x2014;or indeed any time soon; for I can skip (or <hi rend="italic">have</hi> already skipped) till the Book <hi rend="italic">come.</hi></p>
<p>If I had the least strength left, I might end these foul leaves in a week or <pb id="pg-33-176" n="33:176"/>two; but I seem to be quite drowned in disgusts, and to have no heart left in me to contend with the sordid element,&#x2014;so it may last me months.</p>

<p>&#x201C;All right&#x201C;!&#x2014;my Darling! that is to say <hi rend="italic">All wrong!</hi> but nothing <hi rend="italic">new</hi> wrong! When I caught that cold, first thing I did, in the new year; I accepted resignedly the prospect of being confined to my drawing room till the March winds were over; And thus spared myself a deal of useless struggling against Providence.&#x2014;Since I have been feeling up to the present time too sensitive to the weather (which has continued to get colder and colder) for venturing out of doors. At the same time, by taking better care of myself than I used to do I was longer of falling ill this winter than last, and have never except the first two days needed to keep my bed. I have been up to breakfast (in the drawing-room, at the fire of which I dress myself!) all thro&#x2019; the Winter, and <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> in itself, for a woman who has no natural turn for laziness is an immense gain on last year.</p>
<p>If it hadn&#x2019;t been for that unblessed Ann, who has caused me more irritation than she is all worth, I should positively have rather enjoyed my confinement. Our people came earlier to Town than usual on account of the early meeting of Parliament;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1. Parliament had been recalled, <date when="1857-12-03">3 Dec. 1857</date>, for an emergency debate on the Bank Issues Indemnity Bill which sanctioned the Bank of England&#x2019;s action in suspending the gold standard and violating the Bank Charter Act of <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> (see also <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571115-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1857-11-15">15 Nov.</date></ref>). The bill became law, <date when="1857-12-11">11 Dec. 1857</date>. Parliament then adjourned <date when="1857-12-12">12 Dec.</date> and reopened <date when="1858-02-04">4 Feb.</date></note> and they make much less of the long drive to Chelsea when it is no longer on a chance of finding me out. I have quite as much of the outer world as I want to keep me from stagnating. I have a great rug of racoon fur to lie under on the sofa when I am &#x201C;too cold for any thing&#x201C;! and my friends <pb id="pg-33-177" n="33:177"/>supply me with new <hi rend="italic">novels</hi> English and French! which I own to a weakness for, and make no conscience of indulging in, when I am not <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> serious study&#x2014;Wasn&#x2019;t it permitted me to read <hi rend="italic">the Arabian Nights</hi> instead of Rollin&#x2019;s Ancient History<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Rollin, <hi rend="italic">Histoire ancienne des Egyptiens, des Carthaginois, des Assyriens, des Babyloniens, des M&#xE8;des et des Perses, des Mac&#xE9;doniens, des Grecs</hi> (Paris, <date when="1730-00-00">1730</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738-00-00">38</date>); see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221111-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:197</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1822-11-11">11 Nov. 1822</date></corr></ref></note> when I had the <hi rend="italic">measles?</hi> And so I rather liked having the measles; I remember!

Ann<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Who helped JWC with cleaning and cooking; see Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:363.</note> was going to stay three months with her to teach her housekeeping! and would then find &#x201C;a situation with a single gentleman who kept an under servant to do all the rough work&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t she wish she may get it?&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;That is the reason,&#x201C; said M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newnham &#x201C;that she doesn&#x2019;t care a bit now whether she pleases you or not.&#x201C;&#x2014;As this woman never said a word to me of any servant of mine before I took her information as authentic and thanked her for it. Ann was at her Mothers that sunday night and came home quite <hi rend="italic">gracious</hi> and continued gracious for a week!&#x2014;Had the Niece&#x2019;s scheme been visited by &#x201C;the pigs&#x201C; which &#x201C;run thro&#x201C;?&#x2014;I took no more notice of her good temper than I had done of her bad&#x2014;One day Geraldine was here (she came back the very day I last wrote to you).<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><ref target="volume-33/lt-18580116-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1858-01-16">16 Jan.</date></ref>, when JWC criticized Jewsbury.</note> She fell to talking about Ann&#x2014;how her face &#x201C;looked less diabolic&#x201C; &#x201C;It may look as it likes I said; if she does not give me warning on the <date when="1858-02-29">29<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of February</date>, I shall give her warning and be done with it.&#x201C; Geraldine has a way when amused of raising her voice to a scream; and she screamed out &#x201C;you cannot give her warning on the <date when="1858-02-29">29<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> My Dear, for it isn&#x2019;t Leap Year!&#x201C;&#x2014;I had just heard Ann sweeping in my bedroom and any loud speaking can be heard thro the door between the two rooms. I said &#x201C;speak lower&#x201C;; but the shot had already told, I fancy. Ann came up so soon as Geraldine was gone, and while arranging the fire-place said carelessly &#x201C;The coals won&#x2019;t last over another week Mam; I should say they will be out by Saturday.&#x201C; &#x201C;Very well&#x2014;more must be had in on Saturday&#x201C;&#x2014;and I went on reading&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">And</hi>&#x201C; continued Ann &#x201C;if you could by any means <hi rend="italic">suit yourself</hi> I should like to <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> on&#x2014;&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;The <date when="1858-03-29">29th of March</date>&#x201C; I interrupted her&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, you will leave then whether I am suited or not&#x2014;if I had not been so helpless these two months back, I should not have troubled you to stay even till then.&#x201C; Neither of us said another word&#x2014;and both had spoken in the most natural tone! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> went on with my reading and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> swept up the hearth&#x2014;And I call that quite a dramatic ending! for all so quiet as it was!</p>
<p>She does her work now <hi rend="italic">well</hi>&#x2014;to get a <hi rend="italic">character</hi> for the &#x201C;single gentleman&#x201C; and to make herself regretted. but I go on as before never speaking to her but to give my orders and speaking then with perfect good humour&#x2014;All squabbling and exploding has thus been avoided. and so a blue pill or two saved&#x2014;besides one&#x2019;s self respect&#x2014;</p>
<p>This part of it is easy enough! but the next&#x2014;the seeking a new servant&#x2014;<pb id="pg-33-179" n="33:179"/>and, when I have &#x201C;caught my hare,&#x201C; training her! <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I do not contemplate without a shudder&#x2014;especially while the weather is so cruel cold&#x2014;and I could not go about, to make enquiries, or run up and down this windy house to tell anyone what to do but at the risk of my life! Surely surely it will be warmer by the end of March!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Geraldine comes every day for longer or shorter time&#x2014;but she is no use to me in this matter or any other&#x2014;she is so unsettled&#x2014;&#x201C;carried&#x201C; as <hi rend="italic">we</hi> call it&#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">wont</hi> hear a word about M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Mantle<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Mantell.</note> out of her head&#x2014;and there is nothing else she has care to talk about or think about&#x2014;</p>

<p>all the news public and private, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, when he comes in from his two hours walk about Town, asks <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> always in the corner of my own sofa; &#x201C;Well my Dear, what news is there today?&#x201C;&#x2014;which sounds whimsical enough!</p>
<p>My chief annoyance during the winter has been from Ann, who became more and more lalying,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., lolling about, useless, from &#x201C;lalie,&#x201C; &#x201C;lall,&#x201C; lazy, useless person, Scots variant of &#x201C;loll.&#x201C;</note> and sullen, and disobliging till it was clear to me she must be meaning to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">leave</hi>&#x201C; and the uncertainty about the <hi rend="italic">when,</hi> in such a time of helplessness, fretted me extremely&#x2014; It is all settled now however that she is to go at the end of her quarter (29<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March)&#x2014; I have not found anyone to replace her yet, and hardly expect at all to find a person who will go on as smoothly <hi rend="italic">on the whole</hi> as this stiff tempered woman has done for five and a half years. At the same time; beyond the <hi rend="italic">inconvenience</hi> of losing her, there will be no <hi rend="italic">sorrow</hi> about it; for I have <hi rend="italic">never</hi> liked or trusted her <hi rend="italic">as a woman.</hi> In her bland moods as in her sullen ones I have all along thought her about the most artful, and selfish, and impracticable human being I ever lived beside. Her going vexes me chiefly on M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s account; that his <hi rend="italic">servant</hi> should place his pipe on the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> side of the fire and all that sort of thing is much more to him than that she should have a good temper or a good heart; <hi rend="italic">He</hi> does not come in contact with her qualities as a woman, only with her capabilities as a servant. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tait is on the trail of &#x201C;a respectable Scotch woman&#x201C; <pb id="pg-33-180" n="33:180"/>for me; &#x201C;between 24 and 25 years of age&#x201C;&#x2014; Scotch women did not use to be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">respectable</hi>&#x201C; so early! I dont know if anything will come of it.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Gilchrist, our next door neighbour had a &#x201C;thoroughly respectable&#x201C; nurse-maid,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> to whom she &#x201C;forgave an unpleasant temper, for the sake of her good moral character and the example to the children&#x201C;; and one morning before breakfast, the exemplary young woman bore a child, and strangled it, and locked it away in her trunk! and there had to be a coroners inquest<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> and the Devil to pay! Such things happen in well regulated families</p>
<p>My love and a kiss to Jamie.

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>I got y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter yesterday, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I was very glad to read: Jim<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her son James Aitken.</note> seems to be <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the thick of the business at Liverpool; and he must not let himself be repulsed by difficulties. I do not know the Farie he went to; but there is no doubt he wants to help him if he can.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Farie. John Carlyle wrote to Isabella Carlyle from 67 N Hanover St., Edinburgh, <date when="1858-03-03">3 March</date>: &#x201C;I had one letter from J. C. Aitken last week. He has not found any situation either in Manchester or Liverpool &#x26; can only wait as patiently as possible in Liverpool&#x201C; (NLS: Acc. 9086).</note></p>
<p>This morning came the enclosed from Canada to you: it was at first a mystery to me how I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have got hold of it: but on reading Tom&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carlyle, Alexander and Janet&#x2019;s son.</note> little Note, the matter became clear. It is a pleasant cordial and clear delineation by poor Alick, one of the best accounts we have yet got of his real position, and what his Household may be conceived to be like. Doubtless you will send the Letter forward among the rest of the kindred,&#x2014;Dr first.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane is still a close prisoner, sleeps ill &#x26;c &#x26;c; but keeps up her spirits wonderfully too, and has never been <hi rend="italic">so</hi> low at all as she was last winter. Our weather is of the grimmest february sort, the harshest we have had this year: were that <pb id="pg-33-181" n="33:181"/>once gone, the air will be softened, and perhaps she may get out by some sunny blink.</p>
<p>I am but weak myself, tho&#x2019; complaining of nothing special: in fact greatly <hi rend="italic">spent</hi> by the long hideous swim I have had, in an element that has often looked like being <hi rend="italic">too</hi> strong for me.

She had such a perfect mastery of herself, and such a stoical resolution to shut in her own misery from the eyes of the world, that I suppose not many even of her intimate friends ever knew how much she was actually suffering. It was not merely the feeling of utter loneliness, arising from Carlyle&#x2019;s moody absorption in his own work. All this, I believe, she could have borne without flinching. &#x2026; The misery was to be shut up alone with him, when he himself was struggling under his burdens in utter wretchedness and gloominess of heart. When his dark labour-pains were strong upon him &#x2026; he was the most absolutely wretched man I ever saw. &#x2026; But what she felt most keenly of all was, that he never seemed to realize that misery is the most contagious of all diseases. He saw her always invincibly devoted to him; and he thought her lot peaceful and happy in comparison with his own. He never saw the misery his own misery was inflicting upon her, and gradually sapping the very life out of her. &#x2026; And yet, I ought to say, I never once heard an angry word pass between themselves&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 49&#x2013;51).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Lord Grey,</salute>
<p>It is three or four and twenty years since Ballantyne first came in sight to me,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390223-TC-TB-01"><sic>11:32</sic><corr>TC to TB, <date when="1839-02-23">23 Feb. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> and he has continued so, farther off or nearer, ever since: so that I now know him well enough;&#x2014;and can, with great readiness, give testimony of him, since it is of a favourable sort.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-33-183" n="33:183"/>He was, he has told me, originally a Paisley Weaver, eager for reading and so on; but has been at Editing now for 30 years; and, I dare say, thoroughly understands that branch of business. He is an uncommonly honest little man; with a great deal of good-natured aimiability,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2. Thus in MS.</note> frank loyalty of character; a great deal of natural rectitude and good sense,&#x2014;steadily gravitating towards <hi rend="italic">truth,</hi> in regard to persons and to things, so far as his troublous Newspaper element will permit.</p>
<p>He has no great amount of solid information,&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than other Editors, however, <hi rend="italic">more</hi> rather;&#x2014;but his tendencies and persuasions are such as, I imagine, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> find much approval from your Lordship, in some important respects. I read his <hi rend="italic">Statesman</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ballantyne&#x2019;s weekly newspaper.</note> on Saturday nights; find it decidedly less insupportable than the other weekly Newspapers I have tried. Unluckily tho&#x2019; B.&#x2019;s opinions are generally good, his own style of writing is but flaccid, unimpressive; and there is hardly anybody of marked talent yet writing for him. But he knows talent when it turns up; could know where to seek for it, too; and indeed, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, is expert in <hi rend="italic">Editing,</hi> and in all mechanical branches of his craft;&#x2014;only, I fear, this present Enterprise of his is greatly deficient in <hi rend="italic">money</hi> as yet. With money I conceive it possible he might really build up a pulpit of some emphasis for those doctrines of his; and might perhaps do sensible good, in the way of opening the eyes of the quieter Middle Classes to the perils ahead and around; especially to the differences between &#x201C;Reform&#x201C; and <hi rend="italic">Democracy,</hi>&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Ballantyne, to his astonishment, has begun to recognise of late years, with eyes wider and wider!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s influence was apparent in Ballantyne&#x2019;s editorials. For example, he wrote an editorial on &#x201C;National Policy,&#x201C; <date when="1858-01-09">9 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;The evil in England for many years has been that the leaders of the progressive party have been mere laissez-faire theorists, whose hollow talk about universal peace and Utopian philanthropies has no response in the sympathies of the people. &#x2026; The present seeming apathy of the nation is really a sign of health. It is the expression of contempt for phrases and phrasemongers, of a resolution not to stir till there is genuine work to be done. &#x2026; What is Administrative Reform in the largest, in the most comprehensive sense? Is it not the realization of the principle that democracy consists not in the influence of the multitude on public affairs, but in the unobstructed access of the worthiest and most gifted to every office of the state? &#x2026; To vanquish the Doctrinaires and the Utilitarians it will not be sufficient to denounce them. We must besides nourish by example and by potent speech the heroism of the nation.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>On this latter practical point I must not pretend to judge: but to the constant respectability and real worth of Ballantyne I can confidently testify as above,&#x2014;and leave him to your Lordship&#x2019;s insight and goodness.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Grey may have asked TC for a testimonial, because Ballantyne was at the time canvassing the aristocracy for financial support: &#x201C;Ballantyne had not a farthing of capital of his own, and the <hi rend="italic">Statesman</hi> was started and carried on, during its hand-to-mouth life of not many months, with money borrowed, or rather given&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Espinasse</hi> 243). Espinasse tells the story of Ballantyne getting a loan of &#xa3;50 from TC by &#x201C;watching his opportunity, when Mrs. Carlyle was out of town, &#x2026; Carlyle good-naturedly assented, but stipulated for a little delay, as his surplus moneys were in the Annan branch of the old-established Scottish bank, the British Linen Company, so faithfully, even in finance, did he cling to his native region.&#x201C; When JWC found out about the loan she &#x201C;reproached Ballantyne bitterly for his strategem &#x2026; and dilated on the losses which her husband had suffered by lending to impecunious friends.&#x201C; According to Espinasse, TC also gave Ballantyne an introduction to Lord Ashburton, who gave him a cheque of &#xa3;500 (out of which he repaid TC) and introductions to &#x201C;several of the great Whig leaders&#x201C; (243&#x2013;45). Ballantyne had reviewed Grey&#x2019;s recently pbd. <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Government Considered with Reference to Reform of Parliament</hi> (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>) in the <hi rend="italic">Statesman,</hi> <date when="1858-02-06">6 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Lord Grey is a politician unattached and unambitious; one of the few really independent among the many who call themselves so.&#x201C;</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir&#x2014;</salute>
<p>In addition to all other hindrances, I am at present, and for many months back, overwhelmingly busy; every moment of my time occupied. Nor indeed, with such ignorance of the details as is inevitable to me, could it well be advantageous to interfere with advice. A child learns from his father what view of the universe (and also what <hi rend="italic">practice</hi> in it) the father actually <hi rend="italic">has,</hi> not pretends to have; and I should say, it was one of the clearest and most comprehensive duties, on the part of the father, to proceed <hi rend="italic">loyally</hi> with his child,&#x2014;loyally, and with his best wisdom and caution,&#x2014;in this as in other matters.</p>
<p>There is a Book by Jean Paul, called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Levana,</hi> or The Doctrine of Education&#x201C; (some such title); a small volume, which has been translated;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. P. F. Richter, <hi rend="italic">Levana</hi> (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>), trans. as <hi rend="italic">Levana, or the Doctrine of Education</hi> (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>); see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540313-TC-LOA-01"><sic>29:47</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1854-03-13">13 March 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> which I should judge it might be worth your while to procure and study: you will find a great many fruitful ideas in it, in reference to the task you have on hand. In Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> (sequel to Wilhelm&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi>) by Goethe,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s trans. of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels,</hi> see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 24:191&#x2013;416.</note> there is, by intimation rather than by direct lecture on the subject, by far the best account that I have ever known to be written, especially in modern times, of that high matter. I recommend this, on all hands, for many years past, as the Book of Books on Education of the young soul in these broken distracted times of ours;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560719-TC-LOA-01"><sic>31:126&#x2013;27</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1856-07-19">19 July 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> but do not find that almost any English person yet reads it with understanding.</p>

<ps><p>Chelsea [Spring, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>].</p>
<p>In answer to Mr. Lattimer,&#x2014;in great haste,&#x2014;T. C.</p>
<p>1. Forms of devotion, &#x201C;Infant Prayers&#x201C; and other, I should judge, might have a very good effect, on one proviso (but this a rigorous one), That the father himself completely <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> in them. If the father do not entirely believe, if he even unconsciously doubts, still more if he do not even know what belief is, the child will at once more or less clearly feel this; and the <pb id="pg-33-187" n="33:187"/>effects will be <hi rend="italic">bad,</hi> and that only,&#x2014;perhaps to a degree little suspected at present.</p>
<p>2. That we are all &#x201C;bound to speak the truth&#x201C; to our fellow creatures; and the divine importance of doing that is plain enough by this time, or ought to be. But the faithful man here too will keep his eye upon the concrete fact as well as upon the rubric, or <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> of the law; and will know that it is with the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> that he has got to deal. To set up &#x201C;cases of conscience,&#x201C; and puzzle over them, will not much help him. The permitted limits of simulation, who could undertake to define them? We do not <hi rend="italic">inform</hi> the <hi rend="italic">fox,</hi> inquiring of us, where our poultry lodges. All men are entitled at least to keep their thoughts <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> when they please. Answers that have that effect are a refuge possible in most cases.&#x2014;And for the rest there is a far deeper <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi> than that of the tongue; which it is infinitely important to acquire, and which I have often noticed superstitious professors of tongue-truth to be greatly destitute of.</p>
<p>3. All nations that have risen beyond the rank of Samoyedes<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Siberian Mongol tribesmen.</note> have had laws, which they kept as sacred, in reference to matters sexual: and generally the higher they have risen in the scale of nations, the nobler and more imperative have such laws been. <hi rend="italic">Continence</hi> (in this and in all things) is the perpetual duty of all men and all women. Chastity, in the true form of it, is probably the most beautiful of virtues,&#x2014;essential to all noble creatures. A lewd being has fatally lost the <hi rend="italic">aroma</hi> of his existence; and become <hi rend="italic">caput mortuum</hi> [death&#x2019;s head or worthless residue] in regard to the higher functions of intelligence and morality. No frightfuller feature of these ruined generations presents itself than that of their utter corruption in this respect.&#x2014;Alas, what can a parent do in such times? He will need all his wisdom to do even a little for his child in that important particular. For injudicious meddling is capable, I believe, of frightfully <hi rend="italic">worsening</hi> the affair.</p></ps>

<p>Since sending off my Note to you a few hours ago, here is a new phasis!&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Friday 7.45&#x201C; I cannot go. We must say Saturday (i. e Tomorrow Week) at 7, if you can,&#x2014;in short <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> instead of the <hi rend="italic">Wed</hi>y in my Note.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Before receiving this note, Pelly replied, <date when="1858-03-20">20 March</date>, to TC&#x2019;s previous, untraced note asking him to dine the following Wed. [24] with Lord Ashburton: &#x201C;I am honoured by your kind note of yesterday, and it will give me very great pleasure to be permitted to dine with Lord Ashburton and you on Wednesday next. / I thank you for allowing me also to call at your house on the same evening, and I will be punctual to my time.&#x2014;/ Had I been on our Frontier instead of within a few miles of you, I should not have considered the distance as any obstacle to my accepting an invitation to meet you, Sir,&#x2014;Indeed your kindness affects me very much; and though I have been much pleased with, and I trust properly conscious of, the kind notice my Betters have bestowed on me since I arrived in London nothing has moved me until your note.&#x201C; He then replied to this note, also <date when="1858-03-20">20 March</date>: &#x201C;Saturday (this day week) will be a perfectly convenient time; and I will do myself the honour of calling at your house a little before &#xBD; after six on that day instead of upon Wednesday.&#x201C; After the dinner with Lord Ashburton, Pelly described leaving with TC who &#x201C;called a four-wheeler, and said he would drive me as far as Hyde Park Corner. &#x2026; No sooner had we started than he fired up on the politics of the day, and was anything but complimentary to Parliament and the Foreign Office; he became so excited that he stood up and swayed his arms about, quite astonishing me by the fact that a man of genius who largely dominated the thought of his time should so agitate himself with matters which I, at that time, regarded as of little real importance&#x201C; (Sir Lewis Pelly, &#x201C;Glimpses of Carlyle,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi> 51 [<date when="1892-00-00">1892</date>]: 724).</note></p>

Carlyle</name><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pelly later recalled that at a period in his life when he had questioned &#x201C;whether life was worth living,&#x201C; he read TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellanous Essays,</hi> which seemed to give him &#x201C;a new revelation of life&#x201C; (Pelly, &#x201C;Glimpses&#x201C; 51:723). When invited to Cheyne Row in the <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>s, he was immediately impressed by TC, who &#x201C;launched out upon the advantages of a life of action and military discipline; he advised me utterly to avoid that great froth ocean, called literature and specially the thing called poetry&#x201C; (51:723). &#x201C;His language in conversation, as in his writings, was often in sledge-hammer fashion, and yet it did not sound so, for his manner was kindly, natural, and at intervals almost tender&#x201C; (51:725). Pelly later came to tea at Cheyne Row; TC, he noted, &#x201C;soon worried me into an argument and upset everything I ventured to advance.&#x201C; When JWC told TC, &#x201C;Why, when Mazzini was here the other night, you took the side of the argument that Mr. Pelly did this evening,&#x201C; TC responded, &#x201C;And what&#x2019;s the use of a man if he cannot take two sides of an argument?&#x201C; (51:724). Pelly also spoke with TC about Frederick the Great and two of his cavalry generals, Seidlitz and Ziethen [see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:36 and 17:236], whom TC called &#x201C;just famous gallopers.&#x201C; Pelly argued that they showed genius and defended his views with examples. When <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> was published, he &#x201C;was amused to find that [they] had become great cavalry commanders&#x201C; (51:727).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was very glad of your Note yesterday morning; giving me a view of poor old Edinburgh again, in the sunny Spring weather. You will find that pretty much as good as London for a variety; and it has the advantage of being far nearer hand. I can hardly flatter myself with the thought of seeing you <hi rend="italic">here</hi> this season; and must put up with that as with various other disappointments. Indeed I am not worth seeing, nor is anybody much worth being seen by me in my present mood and predicament! I never was so solitary intrinsically; I refuse all invitations; and except meeting people on the street, have next to no communication with external fellow creatures. I walk (with difficulty) long stretches, nothing but Nero attending me:&#x2014;I begin to find I must have my Horse back again, one of these days; my poor inner-man reminds me that such will be my duty!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am sorry to report that since yesterday my poor Jane has caught new cold, and is flung down again,&#x2014;worse probably than before! She had never sunk so weak this year; and we hoped, when the singularly good weather came, it was all over. But within this day or two there has been a change of temperature: and this is where we are,&#x2014;&#x201C;no sleep at all&#x201C; last night, nothing but the sofa and silence for my poor partner. We are changing our servant too; Anne going off (somewhat in the <hi rend="italic">dorts,</hi> and in truth an unsatisfactory creature for a long time back,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">better</hi> to go): but how the new one (a Scotch <hi rend="italic">Inverness</hi> subject, of promising <hi rend="italic">gemuth</hi> [good nature], but inexperienced in <hi rend="italic">house</hi>-work)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Cameron; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580329-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1858-03-29">29 March</date></ref>.</note> is somewhat of a problem. Poor Jane keeps a wonderful heart, whatever comes or goes. Few people that I have seen suffer their allotment in this world in a handsomer manner. I still hope this <hi rend="italic">relapse</hi> will not last long.&#x2014; She has &#x201C;marmalade&#x201C; going on today; a Chelsea artist doing it on whom she can depend;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Mrs. Newnham; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580329-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1858-03-29">29 March</date></ref>.</note> tho&#x2019; herself not able to oversee!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC prided herself on her marmalade making; in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, TC took one of her pots to London with him (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310817-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:336</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-17">17 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>), and in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> she taught the (then) Barings&#x2019; cook at Addiscombe how to make marmalade (see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480404-JWC-TC-01"><sic>23:5</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1848-04-04">4 April 1848</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480407-JWC-TC-01"><sic>23:8</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1848-04-07">7 April 1848</date></corr></ref>).</note></p>

    <p>And yet Ann left at midday, and I heard the new servant come in about half an hour ago! Had I &#x0201C;trusted in Providence&#x0201D; (as your dear Father would have advised) ever so much; I could not indeed have foreseen <hi rend="italic">how</hi> Ann&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Exodus</hi> would be smoothed for me; but I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have foreseen that some way or other it <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be smoothed; so as to try my sick nerves less than it threatened to do, in prospect.</p>
    <p>But first, I must tell you the <hi rend="italic">adventure</hi> of my new servant, for it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> of the <pb id="pg-33-197" n="33:197" />nature of an adventure, my last choice of a servant!&#x02014;how it will turn out Heaven only knows!

M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was mercifully persuaded by Lord Ashburton to go this very day to Addiscombe&#x02014;where I flatter myself he will remain till my &#x0201C;Lieutenant&#x02019;s Daughter&#x0201D; has learnt at least the <hi rend="italic">elements</hi> of &#x0201C;All-work&#x0201D;! <hi rend="italic">So</hi> had Providence prearanged for me!&#x02014; They wanted <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to go too and so great is my faith in the new woman&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">trustworthyness</hi> that I should have left her in charge of the house the same day she entered it; but that I dreaded risking myself in a house which has been all winter uninhabited.&#x02014; I have only been twice out of doors, and only for a quarter of an hour each time&#x02014;the result of my last turn in the street was a new doze of cold&#x02014;which kept me thoroughly miserable most of last week, and has not quite passed over. Lady Sandwich will be <hi rend="italic">three weeks</hi> at Addiscombe however, and perhaps I may go by and by for a few days before she and Lord A return to Town. I know a little change of air would do me good, if I could have it without exposing myself to a fresh attack.</p>
    <p>I was glad to hear of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> having been in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> tho you felt no good from it at the time. one gets into such a <hi rend="italic">rotatory</hi> state of sensation staying always at home, tho&#x02019; one may like home better than any other place</p>
    <p>I was downright sorry for Ann when she left today little as she had earned human sympathy from me. Not that she ever repented of her bad behaviour. or showed any regret at leaving me. Perhaps she felt some regret at leaving her <hi rend="italic">place.</hi> I am not sure. But a <hi rend="italic">Nemesis</hi> overtook her at the last, that made her an object of such compassion that I shook hands with her at parting! and told her that I <hi rend="italic">should have been</hi> extremely sorry at losing her if the last three months could be obliterated from our relation. The Nemesis was an attack of <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi> exactly like one of my own! and she was <hi rend="italic">obliged to ask for help</hi> in getting her affairs here wound up&#x02014;and would have to arrive at her Mother&#x02019;s poor house unable to put a haughty face on herself. It must have been a hard <pb id="pg-33-199" n="33:199" />trial to her pride, being reduced by <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> pain to wear the afflicted look which she was so anxious to avoid. From what she answered, in cold sour self-justification, it was clear to me she would much rather <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have gone, <hi rend="italic">if</hi>&#x02014;I would have allowed her to tyrannize over me! Since I would <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> I must take the consequences myself&#x02014;it seemed to be <hi rend="italic">she,</hi> poor creature, not I, that was taking them this morning!&#x02014; A chance if she ever find a resting place in this world again! Before she came here she had never staid in a place above a year&#x02014;and her temper does not improve by age. When I heard the outer door shut after her, I felt as if she were stept out into confused misery as long as her life!&#x02014;and <hi rend="italic">cried!</hi>&#x02014;The more fool I!&#x02014; I dont think <hi rend="italic">any thing</hi> could possibly have been written <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than the little paper you sent me!&#x02014; Love to your Husband</p>

By a fixed system of settlement we should not only have a resident, but a permanent, and permanently increasing, Christian population. &#x2026; [M]ay we not, in India as elsewhere, vindicate for England her ancient prerogatives of unbounded trade and successful colonisation? &#x2026; I make this motion in the cause of commerce, colonisation, civilization and Christianity&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Settlement in India and Trade with Central Asia</hi> [<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>] 17&#x2013;18).</note> George Rennie (&#x201C;of Phantasy&#x201C; (once!) you <pb id="pg-33-201" n="33:201"/>may remember him at a Dance at your Mother&#x2019;s,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Martha Mary Davidson, b.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your Inclosures yesterday afternoon;&#x2014;I had run out to Addiscombe for a couple of days, and almost got <hi rend="italic">foundered</hi> by the sudden cold there, but stood it off by good riding &#x26;c. Nobody has so little time as I today; but I will send you a word about Jane, as you request.</p>
<p>She has got a great deal of new cold; but is not so much vanquished by it as one might have anticipated. She coughs a good deal (at intervals), sleeps <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> &#x26;c: but holds up her heart; and never ceases to superintend her house, and even to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> at little odds and ends that come within her circle. I never saw anybody so quiet and cheery under great and continual derangement of health. The weather, since a couple of days, continues Russian; but we calculate, it must mend soon, and then there will be other improvements.</p>

<p>I am very sorry J<hi rend="italic">ie</hi> Aitken can fall in with nothing in Liverpool: we must hope he will succeed by and by, by waiting and trying. I suppose nothing more can be done <hi rend="italic">for</hi> him; at all events if there can, you will evidently at once do it.</p>

You can therefore go and shew him some specimens, and confer with him on the subject, when you like. The sooner the better;&#x2014;as all things, at Robson&#x2019;s and elsewhere, seem happily mending their pace, and &#x201C;end of May&#x201C; is the goal <hi rend="italic">recognised</hi> by the principal parties.</p>
<p>One thing I ought to say. These <hi rend="italic">Maps</hi> are at Chap<hi rend="italic">n&#x2019;s</hi> expense, not <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> specially: you ought therefore to covenant for proper remuneration to your Brother;&#x2014;easy to say, &#x201C;It will cost only so and so&#x201C;; and thus fix it before starting.</p>
<p>I have caught cold; and do not get on more triumphantly than usual: but it will and must soon be over!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-33-204" n="33:204"/>Don&#x2019;t bother <hi rend="italic">too</hi> much ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Baireuth &#x26; Cleve-J&#xfc;lich Map: nothing very import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> hangs upon it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin later realized that this comment (not to &#x201C;bother&#x201C;) disguised TC&#x2019;s impatience: &#x201C;Once he was giving me some little bit of copying or map-making to do, and was elaborately impressing on me the importance of dispatch, but at the same time, of there being no actual hurry about it; which was a way he had, like touching-up with the whip, and holding-in with the bridle at the same moment&#x201C; (Larkin, <hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 54).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have had both your Notes; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were very welcome to me: I will write a word today to keep your anxieties in check. Alas, I ought to have written to Jean also long since; and to I know not how many besides! But everything is <pb id="pg-33-205" n="33:205"/>ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my writing; everything down even to the <hi rend="italic">mechanical materials</hi> I have. Nothing will ever reconcile me to those miserable iron-pens, plaster-lime kinds of paper, and other modern improvements; tho&#x2019; I have been driven into them in a kind of self-defence. Often, in writing that beautiful <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> now on hand, I remind myself of the old Spaniard who had to do his &#x2018;on leather with a dagger&#x2019;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alonso de Ercilla y Zuniga, <hi rend="italic">La Araucana</hi> (pbd. in three parts: Madrid, <date when="1569-00-00">1569</date>, <date when="1578-00-00">1578</date>, and <date when="1589-00-00">1589</date>; complete edn.: Madrid, <date when="1590-00-00">1590</date>). Ercilla noted in the prologue that he had to write some parts of the poem on leather as he had no paper.</note>&#x2014;and in fact I detest writing more and more. And expect fairly to <hi rend="italic">end</hi> it, if I can ever finish this that is now on hand. Let all friends be soft with me; for I declare myself hard bested at the present season.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin wrote later: &#x201C;In calling my authorship, drudgery, I do not mean that writing ever gave me the kind of pain of which Carlyle so wildly complains,&#x2014;to my total amazement and boundless puzzlement, be it in passing said; for he talked just as vigorously as he wrote, and the book he makes bitterest moan over, Friedrich, bears the outer aspect of richly enjoyed gossip, and lovingly involuntary eloquence of description or praise&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> [Orpington, <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>] 2:240).</note></p>
<p>Our weather has suddenly got warm, too warm: I am absolutely suffering from heat in my garret here; 3 days ago in thicker clothing there was difficulty in subduing the cold. Jane is now out: poor little soul, she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been joyful &#x26; on the road to <hi rend="italic">well</hi> again, had it not been for that devil&#x2019;s-brood of House-servants! Anne went away, a fortnight ago, as I told you; on the whole, no good farther to be had of <hi rend="small-caps">a</hi>nne,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">better</hi> that she sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go. Then came the usual muster and choice for poor Missus;&#x2014;great <hi rend="italic">fash,</hi> fidget; and at last a simple-looking Scotch lass preferred, who did not <hi rend="italic">know</hi> her <hi rend="italic">work,</hi> but whose physiognomy pleased hugely in the proper quarter. Much new <hi rend="italic">fash</hi> in consequence for the two weeks gone; patient treating of the simpleton, animated by hope, of honesty, veracity, affectionate mind &#x26;c &#x26;c: the whole of which fell again on poor Jane, for I had nothing to do in it except hold my peace; and rejoice in such prospect of all the virtues in a simple form. Night before last, the poor Dame did not sleep, seemed sad too: on pressing into her, I found the Simpleton of Virtues had broken into bottomless <hi rend="italic">lying,</hi> &#x2018;drinking of cream on the road upstairs&#x2019; &#x26;c, &#x26;c, and that in short it was hopeless! And while we yet spoke of it, a poor charwoman<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Newnham; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580516-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [ca. <date when="1858-06-16">16 May</date></ref>], where called the cook.</note> (used to the house) knocked at the room-door, and entered with sudden news That our simpleton was <hi rend="italic">off,</hi> bag and baggage (<hi rend="italic">plus</hi> a sovereign &#x26;c that had just been advanced her); gone (10 p.m.), and had left the pass-key with said charwoman!&#x2014; My poor little sick Partner, I declare it is heartbreaking for her sake. <hi rend="italic">Disgusting</hi> otherwise to a high degree; and <hi rend="italic">dirtier</hi> for the mind than even brushing of boots oneself w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be for the body.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A good few weeks ago, I received your pretty little Essay on the <hi rend="italic">Esprit Fran&#x26;ccedil;ais,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Du g&#xE9;nie fran&#x26;ccedil;ais&#x201C; (Paris, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>); first pbd. in <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> <date when="1857-05-09">9 (May 1857)</date>: 107&#x2013;41. Mont&#xE9;gut echoed TC&#x2019;s argument in <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> that the &#x201C;fire-drama&#x201C; was an expression of the &#x201C;soul-politic&#x201C; as well as the &#x201C;body-politic&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 4:66); he wrote that while the French defined themselves by scepticism and materialism, their true character was spiritual: &#x201C;France is a nation supremely idealistic; its social experiments and its revolutions have all aimed at the highest ideals; this age old and praiseworthy preoccupation is evident from its history. Let us with the help of history try to rediscover the main characteristics of a people apparently so volatile and yet deep down so constant, outwardly so sceptical and inwardly so passionate so that what has been assumed to be a love of reality is a love of the ideal in whatever form it presents itself, church, monarchy or revolution&#x201C; (trans. from <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> 112).</note> which you were kind enough to send me, and even to dedicate to me:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The dedication, presumably written for a pamphlet publication, as it is not included in <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes,</hi> reads: &#x201C;This little work is dedicated to Thomas Carlyle Esq. as testimony of my admiration for his great gifts and deep respect for his character&#x201C; (trans.; <hi rend="italic">Revue de Litt&#xE9;rature Compar&#xE9;e</hi> 474).</note>&#x2014;many thanks to you for both those favours; sincere thanks, tho&#x2019; tardy! Beyond doubt, I ought to have written sooner; and I could have done so from the heart, so far as that went:&#x2014;but I hope you will excuse my apparent <pb id="pg-33-207" n="33:207"/>negligence; I have been, these two years past, overwhelmed in such dreary whirpools<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of <hi rend="italic">Prussian</hi> and other rubbish in the writing way, that the pen (especially this disobedient <hi rend="italic">iron</hi> one) has become a hateful implement to me; and in fact I have hardly written any Note without delays, or written at all till it was evidently forced upon me. Happily something of this is now abating.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Frederic,</hi> Part first (<hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the whole), which has proved such a job as I never undertook in my life before, and would not do again for all Prussia and the next Kingdom added, is now nearly ready,&#x2014;let me be thankful to Heaven! In summer coming I hope to get a long rest somewhere,&#x2014;in some <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> part of the Earth, with no Company but my Horse;&#x2014;Part second will be much easier, if I ever rally to that. But in fact, the whole thing is, even in my own eyes, worth next to nothing; and only important as it has for a long while threatened to be the death of me, and to best me quite in my old days,&#x2014;which it has not yet done. That is the one bright point in it to me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In spite of TC&#x2019;s gloom over <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> John Tyndall (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>; <ref target="volume-33/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27948"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-biographical-notes"><sic>30:286</sic><corr>30:biographical note</corr></ref>) wrote to a friend about a party at Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s, <date when="1858-04-20">20 April</date>, where he sat next to TC: &#x201C;We were the most joyful pair at the table, though nobody lacked glad cheerfulness. It was a regular thorough face to face bit of talk, and I enjoyed it mightily.&#x201C; They talked about science and books, and TC was &#x201C;in choice condition, strong and fervent. His countenance is a wonderful one, and his eyes light up sometimes with almost a superhuman radiance. It seemed to me that I quite got a hold of the old chap, and that we are likely to be permanent friends&#x201C;; TC promised to attend a lecture by Tyndall, <date when="1858-04-21">21 April</date> (typescript of Tyndall to Thomas Hirst, <date when="1858-04-20">20 April</date>: Tyndall Papers, Royal Inst., London).</note></p>
<p>They have been reprinting a &#x2018;general edition&#x2019; of my poor writings, moreover; but I have not taken much trouble with that,&#x2014;helpers did that for me; and now it is pretty well over; will be finished (15 reasonable volumes, and well off my hand) in a couple of months more. If you could point out any method of conveyance to Paris (Barth&#xE8;s and Lovel<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Barth&#xE8;s and Lowell, sellers of foreign books, 14 Gt. Marlborough St., London correspondents of <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes.</hi></note> perhaps?),&#x2014;I would, with much pleasure, despatch you a copy; for I feel well that one of them is yours. Pray settle that matter; apprise me or the Bookseller (Chapman and Hall 193. Piccadilly); and the volumes will go off&#x2014;to a loyal reader of them, who deserves much more of my hands. A lent Book or two of yours I still have; but these you will let me keep for a while longer.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >6. Among other works, Mont&#xE9;gut had lent TC <hi rend="italic">Lettres in&#xE9;dites de Madame la marquise du Ch&#xe2;telet &#xE0; M. le comte d&#x2019;Argental</hi> (Paris, <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>); TC had lost the original copy, and the replacement copy, apparently intended for Mont&#xE9;gut, is in Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea, see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540105-TC-EM-01"><sic>29:6</sic><corr>TC to EM, <date when="1854-01-05">5 Jan. 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I should have said sooner, the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Esprit Fran&#x26;ccedil;ais</hi>&#x201C; gave me great pleasure in the reading,&#x2014;me and others to whom I have lent it about. I found a fine <hi rend="italic">true</hi> eyesight in that Essay; and a true <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> withal, which is the parent of the former.

    <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
    <p>I have now delivered the Picture into the light of day; and a very interesting Picture it is. First, however, let me say that there is intrinsically no harm done by the carriage; a small appendage of the Frame, the little crown-royal at the top (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had been glued on, not nailed on, about 80 years ago, and but carelessly then) has disengaged itself in the shaking of the railway, and gone dancing a little over the canvas, injuring the <hi rend="italic">varnish,</hi> varnish and nothing more, to a quite insignificant extent in one or two places: that is all; and already the touch of a wet finger has rendered it imperceptible. But indeed I think the Picture, before going home again, ought to be a little refreshed by new-varnishing etc:&#x02014;and the <hi rend="italic">label,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is &#x0201C;Frederick <hi rend="italic">3</hi>d&#x0201D; (a common English and French error in those days) ought to be made &#x0201C;Fred<hi rend="italic">c</hi> II,&#x0201D; and the Painter&#x02019;s name given.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Vernon gave TC&#x02019;s letters, his own copy of the first edn. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> and the portrait of Frederick with an account of how it came into the possession of his grandfather, Sir John Borlase-Warren (<date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>&#x02013;<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>), to the Athenaeum Club, <date when="1911-00-00">1911</date> (<hi rend="italic">Recollections</hi> 159). The portrait now hangs in the hall inside the main entrance of the Club to the right of the central staircase; it is correctly labeled &#x0201C;Frederick II. / King of Prussia / by Francke of Potsdam. / Presented by / The Hon. W. Warren Vernon&#x02014;<date when="1911-00-00">1911</date>.&#x0201D; When TC returned the picture, <date when="1860-02-00">Feb. 1860</date>, he advised Vernon: &#x0201C;There is no doubt but the Picture is an <hi rend="italic">original:</hi> and to enhance and secure whatever worth it may have, I think you should introduce (fixed say on the back of the Canvas) that Note by the original Proprietor, which is in your Catalogue, and gives the date etc. in an authentic form,&#x02014;needing only <hi rend="italic">your</hi> signature (and the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> date) to make it valid to the present and the future time.&#x02014;That Note was to me an essential part of the interest this Picture excited, and it ought not to be lost&#x0201D; (MS: Athenaeum; <hi rend="italic">Recollections</hi> 158). Any account of the portrait&#x02019;s provenance is untraced but possibly attached to the back of the picture.</note>

Francke must have picked up his likeness, as others did, by <hi rend="italic">watching</hi> Fred<hi rend="italic">c</hi>,&#x02014;or it is perhaps conceivable the King may have helped him a little (allowed him to stand <hi rend="italic">nearer,</hi> at some parade or so) for the Masons&#x02019; or Daun &#x26; S&#x02019;s sake, <hi rend="italic">more</hi> likely the Masons<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss">Vernon wrote: &#x0201C;Tradition says that this portrait is the only one for which Frederick sat, but Mr. Carlyle suggests that he probably did not sit at all, but favoured Francke of Potsdam at a review, as the attitude in which the King is represented standing is just like that of a man sitting on a horse&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Recollections</hi> 140&#x02013;41).</note> if either;&#x02014;but it is impossible to say which <pb id="pg-33-212" n="33:212" />Picture was the first painted: and possibly enough Francke (not much of an Artist, tho&#x02019; eminently successful this time) may have painted <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than these 3 that we know of; and indeed may have been ready to supply any Tourist passing that way who liked to go to the expense.</p>
    <p>The First Half of my poor Book on Fred<hi rend="italic">c</hi> is coming out in a couple of months. If I can ever do the latter Half, I had decided long ago that this was to be a frontispiece to one of the volumes;&#x02014;the Photograph to be engraved if we c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do no better. Of course your Picture will do much better than a Photograph: but it will not be needed for perhaps two years; or alas perhaps never at all, if matters go too hard with me!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss">Frontispiece to vol. 5 (<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>) of the first edn., where the caption reads: &#x0201C;From a picture by Francke, of Potsdam; painted for the Herren Schickler, Bankers, Berlin, in whose Banking-House it still is; / Copies or Repetitions by Francke himself occur in English Collections.&#x0201D;</note>
    </p>
    <p>In these circumstances, I think I will ask you to let me keep the Picture for a few weeks, till I satiate myself with seeing it:<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC kept the painting for nearly two years; see above and <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580421-TC-WWV-01">TC to WWV, [<date when="1858-04-21">21 April</date>]</ref>.</note> once satiated, it will be safer that I return it to your own keeping till once the question of <hi rend="italic">engraving</hi> rises,&#x02014;a very glad question for me, but a fearful way off as yet!</p>
    <p>If you chanced to be riding this way, I could with pleasure shew you the Berlin Photograph. How pleasantly obliged I am by your kindness in sending me the Picture. I will not trouble you further by saying; but for several reasons I ought to keep the fact well in remembrance.</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>It hasn&#x2019;t been thro negligence, I assure you, that I have allowed so many days to pass without fulfilling your small wish. thro&#x2019; the very opposite of <pb id="pg-33-213" n="33:213"/>negligence it has been!&#x2014;thro a desire on my part to do the thing <hi rend="italic">better than well</hi>&#x2014;a very pernicious tendency in female human nature, as I have had frequent opportunities to observe in my own experience as well as other peoples&#x2014;for in wishing to do a thing better than well, one often enough fails to do it at all!</p>
<p>I should have liked, you see, to send you the picture, <hi rend="italic">framed;</hi> but if there is amongst &#x201C;created objects&#x201C; anything more apt to get broken in the carriage than <hi rend="small-caps">eggs,</hi> it is precisely <hi rend="italic">glazed</hi> picture-frames!!&#x2014; I have tried sending one over and over again and always &#x201C;the wreck was total&#x201C;&#x2014;for not only does the glass get broken but the broken glass scratches and spoils the picture&#x2014; There is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> way in which I have conveyed the thing safely, and that is amongst my clothes, in my own trunk. But unfortunately I am not at liberty to start for the Gill just at present&#x2014;with my trunk! and the only other resource I could think <pb id="pg-33-214" n="33:214"/>of was to have the photograph put in one of those leather cases that shut, if there were any such of sufficient size. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> I could only inform myself about at a shop on the other side of London, and the only two fine days since I got your letter, up to yesterday I was obliged by what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C calls &#x201C;a pressure of <hi rend="italic">Things,</hi>&#x201C; to drive in another direction&#x2014; So it was only yesterday that I satisfied myself there was no case, of the size needed, procurable; and now I do what I should have done at the first&#x2014;send the photograph <hi rend="italic">without</hi> a frame, and the frame will come <hi rend="italic">in my trunk,</hi> when, please God, I go to Scotland this summer or autumn! There is a sencond<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> copy of the photograph of <hi rend="italic">the horse</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably taken in the autumn before Fritz went to The Grange; photograph untraced.</note>&#x2014;which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C says Jamie at Scotsbrig is to have &#x201C;if he care for it&#x201C;&#x2014;of course I should think he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> care for it!&#x2014;So take your choice and give him one of them the first safe opportunity.</p>
<p>I send you a most extraordinary likeness of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;which will give you if not much satisfaction at least, a hearty laugh. He has a trick of always turning his eyes out of his head when he is being &#x201C;taken&#x201C; the consequences of which are truly awful! There are also two photographs of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">study</hi>&#x2014;in which you will recognise the old table, fire-screen<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the study with TC&#x2019;s desk and the firescreen in the background, see 13 and 32:frontispiece.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>A short word will be welcomer to you than none at all. Your Scotsbrig Letter came yesterday, as the former Edinburgh one had done in its due time: I am glad to conceive you again among the peaceable native scenes, after this little excursion, which will give you a new relish for them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had visited Edinburgh, early March (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580210-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1858-02-10">10 Feb.</date></ref>).</note> One does <pb id="pg-33-215" n="33:215"/>get lazy, as you say, <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> laying new and ever new loads on one&#x2019;s back; one has less and less of a motive too for stirring from the spot. I too feel the old universal Law getting very valid upon me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane, I am glad to tell you, is getting out of her peculiar difficulties. She stirs up and down, walks a little out of doors, almost daily,&#x2014;avoiding only the palpably <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> days;&#x2014;and is coming on, steadily as the summer, I hope. Monday next, we are to go out to Addiscombe;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580505-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1858-05-05">5 May</date></ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">till</hi> monday following; nobody to be there, &#x26;c &#x26;c, very rational terms; and we calculate it may do us both good; her especially, to whom the sight of green grass is a novelty and charm. I will get her a close vehicle; I am to ride out, taking my horse with me, who ought to be an inseparable companion.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Printers got their <hi rend="italic">last</hi> lot of Copy (only a sheet or two left here, for bothering adjustments,&#x2014;especially <hi rend="italic">abridgements,</hi> if such were possible): within the month,&#x2014; after bother and dreary fidgetting enough to me in the interim,&#x2014;they <hi rend="italic">will</hi> almost certainly have done! Truly I am quite worn out; not so much feeling any specific illness, as utter lassitude, want of heart, extreme excitability &#x26;c &#x26;c. I am grown a good deal whiter on the temples since you saw me. I have not the least satisfaction in this Book, except thankfulness that I have honestly done with it so far. A rest, and a good long one, is very desirable for me.</p>
<p>I in general have dreamed vaguely of a couple of months, <hi rend="italic">alternating</hi> between Scotsbrig and the Gill; horse daily, milk &#x26; meal in abundance, peace &#x26; silence &#x26;c &#x26;c: but there is nothing fixed; still less have I applied either to Isabella or Mary<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s sister-in-law, Isabella Carlyle at Scotsbrig, and his sister, Mary Austin at the Gill.</note> on the subject. In y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last Note there is something of an Arthur<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Watt, John&#x2019;s stepson, at school in Edinburgh, living at 11 Hill St., with Susan and James Stirling; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570702-TC-JAC-01"><sic>32:169</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1857-07-02">2 July 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> coming to Scotsbrig;&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> let me in no wise <hi rend="italic">prevent</hi> in the vague state of my affairs.

Or I might have a run into Germany, and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> &#x201C;Fried<hi rend="italic">h&#x2019;s</hi> Battlefields&#x201C;: in short, nothing is fixed.&#x2014; <closer><salute>My kind love to Jamie &#x26; everybody.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>We are out here for a few days of country air and quiet, which it was thought Jane might profit by, and I too: we came on Monday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC writes on Wed.</note> and are doing very well hitherto;&#x2014;are to stay till Monday next, and then take ourselves home again. I have my horse with me; and my principal utility here is to go riding with the hospitable Lord of the place, who is an excellent horseman but prefers company to solitude in his excursions thro&#x2019; these beautiful neighbourhoods. Three hours of it aday we have; the rest of my time goes to idle reading, lounging, smoking,&#x2014;with perhaps a <hi rend="italic">Proofsheet</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had rather not <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> till my return home. We are printing along without abatement of speed; and I still hope to see the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of it about the end of this month or shortly after. Which will be a welcome event indeed!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Country is beautful as May itself; this (about noon now) is one of the finest days I ever saw: all is beautiful here and around,&#x2014;and all is very sad to me and others! It was yesterday gone a year that the presiding Genius<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton.</note> of it was called suddenly away; and left a blank that will never be filled up to those that staid behind! It is the universal lot of man: what can we say? At the years I have now got to, the world is by necessity becoming a very vacant place.</p>
<p>Jack had got home from Edinburgh, before I left home; he had set up his staff at Scotsbrig again,&#x2014;probably you have seen him, or may soon see. I was dreaming of some month or two months <hi rend="italic">alternation</hi> between Scotsbrig and The Gill; but there had nothing been fixed; and the Doctor talked about some of the Watts<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Watt brothers, Thomas, Henry, William, and Arthur, John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s four stepsons from his marriage to Phoebe (d. <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>).</note> being with him (perhaps having already come), whom of course I must not interfere with. I have yet fixed nothing, except that I must get <hi rend="italic">away.</hi></p>
<p>No good news yet, I fear, from Liverpool: it is impossible to get into a place if there <hi rend="italic">are</hi> none discoverable. I pity poor Jim<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Aitken.</note> who is doubtless filled with anxieties and desire to be successful: I suppose you find it usefuller to preach <hi rend="italic">patience</hi> than any other doctrine to the poor fellow. &#x201C;Dinna tine heart; if thou tine heart, thou tines a&#x2019;!&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; Margaret A.

<salute>Dearest Betty</salute>
<p>I have so many things to tell you, and leisure just now for telling them, if I only were sure of your address! Your Husband saIt <hi rend="italic">was</hi> your husband,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Braid.</note> was it not? who wrote the paragraph, in your last letter, which was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> handwriting? It could not surely be George?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George, their only child, &#x201C;died of paralysis soon after this date,&#x201C; according to A. Carlyle (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:139); the <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date> census records him as being &#x201C;in bad health,&#x201C; but he was to live until <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>.</note>) said, that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">after May</hi>&#x201C; it would be the new address,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They were moving to Upper Stenhouse, Liberton.</note> but I can&#x2019;t tell whether this meant after the beginning of May or after May was ended.</p>
<p>So I shall just write a short letter today&#x2014;which may be lost between the two houses without harm done! And if you would, without troubling yourself to write a letter, just put on paper the precise date when the old address is to be discontinued, and send <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to me; then you shall have a letter from me as long as my arm!</p>
<p>I have been here a week (on a visit at Lord Ashburtons, to try and pick up a little strength after my four months confinement. It is the first visit I have made at any of Lord A&#x2019;s Places since Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s death, and the first coming was very miserable&#x2014;every thing exactly as she had left it; and yet such a difference! But I am getting accustomed to missing her; and her Mother,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich.</note> who is here, and Lord A himself do all they can to make one comfortable in the house.</p>
<p>I can&#x2019;t say I feel much <hi rend="italic">stronger,</hi> but the change of air and daily carriage exercise make me sleep better than I had done for many months, and that <hi rend="italic">must</hi> benifit me, surely, in the long run&#x2014;besides being much pleasanter for the time than lying tossing about awake.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-33-219" n="33:219"/>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Erskine wrote me strong regrets about your going so far away from his rubber<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A masseur. Thomas Erskine wrote to JWC, <date when="1858-04-28">28 April</date>: &#x201C;I have been entertaining the hope that George that poor son of theirs whose lot in life seems so dark, might receive benefit from the treatment of a certain Mr Beveridge who has performed sundry wonderful cures by rubbing&#x2014; George thinks that there is already a slight improvement &#x26; he evidently has brighter expectations for the future than he has ever thought of indulging before.&#x201C; Mr. Beveridge is possibly John Beveridge (b. ca. <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>), 30 London St., &#x201C;practitioner for synovial diseases&#x201C; (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date> Edinburgh <hi rend="italic">Post Office Directory</hi> and <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date> census).</note>&#x2014;who he thinks was certainly doing George good.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Erskine has always seemed to me, for a clever man, surprisingly credulous about new cures!</p>
<p>I should think the fresh country air<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Liberton was on the S outskirts of Edinburgh.</note> more likely to mend George than the rubbing! What I am most anxious about is, how your husband is going to employ his time out there, and how you are to keep the pot boiling!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine was also concerned about Alexander Braid &#x201C;leaving his shop &#x26; going away to live idle in a cottage. &#x2026; There is little to be made by such shops as theirs, I believe, but it gives him an occupation, which is wholesome assuredly&#x201C; (<date when="1858-04-28">28 April</date>). His death certificate records that he had been a stonemason, presumably when younger, before having the shop at 15 Adam St. The <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date> census records him as &#x201C;unable to work,&#x201C; and the <date when="1871-00-00">1871</date> census as a retired victual dealer.</note> Do you know Dear?

<p><salute>Dear Mrs. Gilchrist:</salute> I would go in to <hi rend="italic">speak,</hi> but that I should probably bring you away from something.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I wish I were beside you for an hour, to tell you by word of mouth my history since I last wrote! by word of mouth, I could make as amusing a story of it, as my Aunt Anne&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Welsh.</note> story of the little bad dog. But writing takes time, and &#x201C;a certain&#x201C; regard to grammar and penmanship and punctuation, in the midst of all which the spirit of the thing evaporates!</p>
<p>Oh my Dear! Miss Cameron! my Lieutenants Daughter!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Cameron; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580329-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1858-03-29">29 March</date></ref>.</note> I was prepared for the chance of that speculation breaking down <hi rend="italic">absurdly,</hi> under the difficulty of a Ladys maid transforming herself, like the Columbine of a Pantomime, into a maid-of-all-work; but I was not prepared for its breaking down <hi rend="italic">shockingly, dangerously,</hi> and my <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> Lieutenant&#x2019;s Daughter turning out an&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Irish</hi> Impostor!</p>
<p>See where one may be led by conceit in one&#x2019;s own power of reading faces! and by a whim for having a servant of sensibility! that whim might easily have cost me all my plate and valuables; and that I escaped with a trifling loss is due only to that Providence who is proverbially &#x201C;kind to <hi rend="italic">Women</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fools</hi> and drunk people."</p>
<p>It would be too long, to go into all the details of the &#x201C;Miss Cameron&#x201C; adventure in a letter. I may make you laugh with them some future day when we meet. Enough for the present that &#x201C;Miss Cameron&#x201C; lasted just a fortnight and three days; that under my lessons, and the lessons of a professed Cook (daily lessons paid half a crown each!) she was making miraculous progress in <hi rend="italic">housemaiding</hi> and cooking, (not so miraculous when one came to know that her ignorance had been all feigned!) that she spoke sentiment, to <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than my hearts content; that strange things were constantly happening that might have opened my eyes if I had not kept them resolutely shut; that, quite accidentally, at last, I convicted her of <hi rend="italic">lying</hi> and <hi rend="italic">stealing,</hi> and, in the excitement of the moment, <hi rend="italic">speaking indubitable Irish!</hi>&#x2014;and that while lying on the sofa sick at heart and <hi rend="italic">stomach,</hi> with the disappointment and disgust; <hi rend="italic">considering,</hi> (like the Piper&#x2019;s cow),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the ballad &#x201C;The Tune the Old Cow Died Of&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570911-JWC-LAI-01">JWC to <sic>Lady Airlie</sic><corr>LAI</corr>, [<date when="1857-09-11">11 Sept. 1857</date></ref>].</note> I was cut out of all hesitations by Miss Cameron taking the initiative and <hi rend="italic">running away!</hi> It was between ten and eleven at <pb id="pg-33-223" n="33:223"/>night that I suddenly found myself without a servant! &#x201C;An excellent riddance I think!&#x201C; said M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> thought of the fire-lighting in the morning! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newnham (the cook) who came to announce to me Miss Camerons flight could not stay the night on account of a sick child, knew &#x201C;a little girl&#x201C; whom she could safely recommend to fill a gap&#x2014; &#x201C;Bring her&#x201C; I said in desperation, and a little girl<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Southam.</note> was presently lodged in bed here, with no other instructions but to light the fires in the morning</p>
<p>Of course she &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">slept in</hi>&#x201C;; little girls always do! I who had slept none at all, naturally, had to get up and awake her; but once on foot she surprised me by her activity and sharpness. After a days trial of her I said to myself better go on with this <hi rend="italic">child,</hi> till I could find some really suitable servant, than, by impatience, get into a second mess&#x2014; After three days trial I said &#x201C;better keep this <hi rend="italic">little girl</hi> till M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C leaves town and the new servant can be installed without bother to <hi rend="italic">him.</hi>&#x201C; After a weeks trial I said &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be hanged if this little girl is not as good a servant as most grown women! better engage her in permanence&#x201C;! So here I have gone and done another romantic thing! taken for servant a girl of sixteen!! She has now been with me a month and I have not repented my choice</p>
<p>Of course I need to get in the cook two or three times a week&#x2014;and to take a deal more charge of things myself than has been my habit. But <hi rend="italic">morally</hi> I am much more comfortable than I was with Anne. It is such a kindly, <hi rend="italic">human, open</hi> little girl! besides being the wonderfullest little worker, for activity, and order, and intelligence. So this topic may rest in peace for the present!</p>
<p>We went to Addiscombe (one of Lord A&#x2019;s places) for a week&#x2014;and I was much freshened up by the change of air and the daily carriage-exercise&#x2014;</p>
<p>Lord Ashburtons kindness and womanly-attentions were quite touching&#x2014; he used to be just like one of the <hi rend="italic">visitors</hi> in his wife&#x2019;s time.</p>
<p>All this bother of all-work and my weeks absence must excuse my long silence. Thank you most sincerely for the sketch<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.

    <salute>Dear Owen,</salute>
    <p>In <hi rend="italic">Wilton Street</hi> (leading from Knightsbridge into Wilton Crescent and Belgrave Square), a large body of Navvies are digging foundations for new Houses; passing these this afternoon in the rain, I was struck by two facts, First that the earth where they were, an extensive space, about 8 or 9 feet deep by this time, had <hi rend="italic">never been stirred before,</hi> for most part (as was evident by the clay <hi rend="italic">strata</hi> &#x26;c); and Secondly that they were in the very act of <hi rend="italic">digging up a considerable quantity of bones,</hi>&#x02014;entire skeletons of some kind of quadruped creatures (to all appearance) being imbedded there. My first notion was of <hi rend="italic">elks,</hi> or the like; but I know nothing whatever of such matters: thigh-bones, shoulder-blade, ribs &#x26;c were about the <hi rend="italic">size</hi> of a horse&#x02019;s (I thought), but of a shape wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seemed different. In another quarter I saw the broken remnants of something which might have been <hi rend="italic">hyaena</hi>ish or <hi rend="italic">bear</hi>ish,&#x02014;evidently a different kind of creature. The strangeness of the thing made me pause in the rain; and try what I could to induce the barbarous fellows to &#x0201C;send for Professor Owen&#x0201D;; to &#x0201C;tell their master about it at least,&#x0201D;&#x02014;to do something or other before they knocked the phenomenon quite to ruin! <pb id="pg-33-225" n="33:225" />

      They grinned benevolently upon me; but I might as well have addressed three Horses as the three individuals I successively [spoke to]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Words omitted by TC.</note>
    </p>
    <p>I called afterwards (tho&#x02019; in great haste) at the Albemarle-Street place,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">The Royal Institution, 21 Albemarle St.</note> in search of you or some hook upon you; next at the Geological Museum;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Museum of Practical Geology (founded <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), 28&#x02013;31 Jermyn St., with an entrance also in Piccadilly.

Perhaps it is all moonshine; such phenomenon of bones in such situation not <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> looking at or attending to; but on the other hand, the contrary is possible:&#x02014;and in short I find I cannot go quietly to bed without having at least given you notice, and cleared my own conscience. If you do walk down tomorrow (not otherwise), please to tell me what kind of creatures they were that employed those bones so many thousand years ago.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss">Owen replied, <date when="1858-05-21">21 May</date>: &#x0201C;Dear Carlyle / I thank you for so kindly thinking of me in connection with your observations made at the diggings in Wilton Street. / The excavators have there dug through, first, about 4 feet of made-earth, in which are fragments of brick and other rubbish; then comes a thin bed of clay, with flint pebbles; &#x26; under this is the gravel bed which extends far over that region, and has, in neighbouring spots, yielded up bones of Mammoths, Rhinoceroses, huge Oxen, &#x26; other pliocene Mammals. All the bones which the navvies had got when you saw them, together with those obtained the following day, had been, with one exception, sold by them to two dealers in old bones (for grinding up, not scientific progress). The remaining specimen was a bone of a Whale, but it had been sawed across at both ends, and was found in this state, which makes me think that the other bones may have been from the &#x02018;made-earth&#x02019; stratum. However, the Clerk of the Works, an intelligent man, has promised to have carefully preserved any other bone that may turn up. / Will you &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle come to us on sunday: we have now Judge Martin &#x26; his wife, from New Zealand. Dinner at 5 p.m. the earlier the better. / Yours sincerely, R<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Owen.&#x0201D; William Martin (ca. <date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x02013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>) and Mary Ann Martin, b.

<p><salute>Thanks, dear Brother, for your two successive Letters.</salute> I have been kept in a wretched <hi rend="italic">feckless</hi> state of confusion all this while,&#x2014;like a tired horse, not allowed to get to his stall;&#x2014;worried incessantly with small odds and ends, requiring settlement before the thing close. By the end of this week, however, I do expect to see the whole <hi rend="italic">in type;</hi> a little haggling with Proof-sheets, and it will be all done! It seems almost like a dream that such consummation sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be at hand; that in two or three days I shall actually have that intolerable burden off my back. Many a time, in weak hours, it has appeared to me as I should never get out of it alive; as if the disgusting chaos w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prove too strong for my swimming powers in this weakened obstructed state! But it proves not so; and that is a subject of thankfulness to me;&#x2014;almost my one conquest in the enterprise, I believe.</p>
<p>The Book done, I must immediately begin strict consideration of the question, Whitherward to run? Nothing definite can I yet settle. The world is all grown somewhat vacant to me; the cities of refuge in it fewer and fewer, with increase of years;&#x2014;a piece of the Common lot, this too. Most of the friends whom I yet have are about Scotsbrig and the neighbourhood: some indubitable affection still left thereabouts;&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a grand consideration in choice of place in this wearied humour! But we shall examine strictly when the Proofsheets are done. Tell me a little what <hi rend="italic">riding conveniences</hi> there are in Annandale: the excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> brown chesnut,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I rode last time, I think you said was sold? I must consider my horse too, and what I shall do with him. It is the one medicine that has done anything for me in these abstruse whirlpools;&#x2014;an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> horse, too, this of mine proves, and much my <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> from old acquaintance. He is getting very brisk, this summer; better than for a twelemonth<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> <pb id="pg-33-228" n="33:228"/>past;&#x2014;I sometimes suspect the hot close stable he has here of doing him ill;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had begun to want Fritz returned to London in late <date when="1858-03-00">March</date> (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580326-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1858-03-26">26 March</date></ref>), and apparently the horse was brought there from The Grange sometime in April (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580501-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1858-05-01">1 May</date></ref>). Fritz probably was kept at Pearson Till&#x2019;s livery stables, 40 Church St. and 41 Manor St., Chelsea (see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550827-TC-JN-01"><sic>30:43</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1855-08-27">27 Aug. 1855</date></corr></ref>).</note>&#x2014;but there are two or three ways in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> dispose of him.</p>
<p>Poor Jane is weak again; the weather to me (genial warmth, with a good deal of rain and wind in it) is perfection; but it proves obstructive to her weak faculty, of taking exercise, and standing damp &#x26;c and she is sensibly weaker for a fortnight past. Today her two Cousins<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maggie and Mary Welsh.</note> (on the road homeward, but taking gaieties in London as they pass) are come over, for the second time since their arrival: by no means the kind of company for poor Jane; who w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> need some <hi rend="italic">elder Sister</hi> (if there were one) to take the whole charge off her, and put her quietly to sleep! Alas, we can find no such person now. She makes, as it were, no complaint whatever even to her own self; but struggles daily to compose all her bits of duties; and is even very cheerful when under no special pressure. A courageous little soul; but distressingly weak and feckless,&#x2014;alas, I can merely be <hi rend="italic">distressed,</hi> but do almost nothing else for her.</p>
<p>Your picture of Waugh, grown an ugly old hulk of a Pauper, is very tragical: but he was tending towards that this long while, if we had seen him well.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Smith Waugh (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), physician; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470912-TC-JAC-01"><sic>22:65</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1847-09-12">12 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>; he d. in Sept.</note> No kind <hi rend="italic">fortune</hi> interposed between his <hi rend="italic">tendencies</hi> and their whitherward; and there he is at the goal, poor soul. It was very well of you to leave some little money for him: as you have a good way of administering there, I shall be willing to contribute my share towards anything that can really alleviate the poor old kinsfellow and brother mortal.</p>
<p>Pray send this over to Jean, from whom I had a Note (&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Photograph</hi> very good,&#x201C; Jane says).<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the same photograph JWC had sent to Mary Austin; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580400-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [<date when="1858-04-00">April</date>/<date when="1858-05-00">May</date>?]</ref>.</note> Here is the horse! &#x201C;The O&#x2019;ss, Sir!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>I send my brotherly regards to Jamie and everybody; and am</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I am a great sinner;&#x2014;but yet you know not the loads I have been under! One day I will say my <hi rend="italic">Pater peccavi</hi> [Father I have sinned]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the Vulgate Bible, Luke 15:18.</note>; and you will pity and forgive.&#x2014; The truth is, the life and intellect are nearly extinct in me by that long imprisonment in the (Prussian) <hi rend="italic">Whale&#x2019;s Belly,</hi> cut off from the light of the sun and all cheerful human things;&#x2014;two years constant; 8 years off and on! Jonah&#x2019;s adventure<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Jonah 1:17.</note> was but a trifle [in]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> comparison. Not above once in the six months, on evident compulsion, have I tried dining out; and every time, let me try as I will, I am sensibly more wretched (and also more stupid) for a week after.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For John Tyndall&#x2019;s description of TC at a dinner party, see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580416-TC-EM-01">TC to EM, <date when="1858-04-16">16 April</date></ref>.</note> In some days more, the Printers will get their last Proofsheet from me (last <hi rend="italic">Slips</hi> coming this very night perhaps); and then, my notion is&#x2014;to fly to milk-diet, silence, and the ends of the world, for unlimited periods! Not without seeing you first, however; you and a friendly face or two more.</p>
<p>Our country excursion, on which you found us gone,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Addiscombe, <date when="1858-05-03">3</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-05-10">10 May</date>.</note> was by no means of jovial purpose,&#x2014;medicinal rather, for one thing;&#x2014;and indeed my poor Wife got evident benefit out of it (as did I); only that she caught <hi rend="italic">face-ache,</hi> coming home; and has fallen as weak almost as ever, in these late wet days. I am grieved and distressed to see her; nothing but the unsubduable spirit she has keeps her on foot at all.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Essays of Forster</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Historical and Biographical Essays,</hi> 2 vols. (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>).</note> lie on the table downstairs; getting themselves read night by night: it was really a negligence (unforgiveable in other circumstances) not to thank you sooner for that Gift. So many botherations come, I hardly get one hour of good reading per night,&#x2014;my nerves are so weary too. That is a capital stroke of Historical Investigation, and honest Labour and Insight that of The Grand Remonstrance.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An indictment of the personal govt. of Charles I and a petition demanding reforms, presented to him in <date when="1641-12-00">Dec. 1641</date> by the House of Commons under the leadership of John Pym (<date when="1584-00-00">1584</date>&#x2013;<date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>). In &#x201C;The Debates on the Grand Remonstrance. <date when="1858-11-00">November</date> and <date when="1641-12-00">December 1641</date>&#x201C; (1:1&#x2013;175), Forster compared the account of the debates given in <hi rend="italic">The History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England</hi> (Oxford, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date> [1st edn.: 3 vols., <date when="1702-00-00">1702</date>&#x2013;<date when="1704-00-00">4</date>]) 2:40&#x2013;67 by Edward Hyde, 1st earl of Clarendon (<date when="1609-00-00">1609</date>&#x2013;<date when="1674-00-00">74</date>), the king&#x2019;s supporter, with the less well-known account given in the journal of Sir Simonds D&#x2019;Ewes (<date when="1602-00-00">1602</date>&#x2013;<date when="1650-00-00">50</date>; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451123-TC-JAC-01"><sic>20:60</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1845-11-23">23 Nov. 1845</date></corr></ref>), antiquary and opponent of Charles I.</note> I know what that kind of thing <pb id="pg-33-230" n="33:230"/>involves; and how few of existing &#x201C;Historians&#x201C; have the least notion of it. <hi rend="italic">Without</hi> the like of wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> however, no History is worth writing or worth reading (except by blockheads, of the <hi rend="italic">temporary</hi> sort). You have curiously <hi rend="italic">found out</hi> that phenom<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of Hon. Members standing with their swords ungirt, &#x201C;pressing their swords on the floor,&#x201C; impatient to whip them out, at that late hour, two centuries ago;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The proposal to print the Grand Remonstrance before presenting it to the King was opposed by a large section of the House of Commons on the grounds that it was an unprecedented appeal direct to the people over the head of the King and before being debated in the House of Lords. Swords were drawn for the first time in the House of Commons during the debate, <date when="1641-11-22">22 Nov. 1641</date>. Forster quotes D&#x2019;Ewes&#x2019;s description of the protest: &#x201C; &#x2018;[S]ome waved their hats over their heads, and others took their swords in their scabbards out of their belts, and held them by the pummels in their hands, setting the lower part on the ground&#x2019;&#x201C; (1:112).</note>&#x2014;phenom<hi rend="italic">n</hi> not to be understood before. There is a great deal of faithful research, victorious inquiry and insight; some very striking pictures too: an indisputably meritorious Piece;&#x2014;dreadfully rare, the like of it, at present!</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Glad indeed I am to hear of you on any terms, on any subject!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written, <date when="1858-05-17">17 May</date>, with an introduction for &#x201C;good friends of mine,&#x201C; Annie, b. Rives (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>) and Joseph Longworth (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1883-00-00">83</date>), son of Nicholas Longworth (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>) and a wealthy Cincinnati lawyer, horticulturalist, and patron of the arts. The introduction allowed Emerson &#x201C;to break up my long contumacy to-you-ward&#x201C; and to inquire: &#x201C;Tell me what is become of &#x2018;Frederic,&#x2019; for whose appearance I have watched every week for months?&#x201C; (Slater <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 520).</note> For the last 18 months I have pretty much ceased all human correspondence,&#x2014;writing no Note that was not in a sense wrung from me; my one society the <hi rend="italic">Nightmares</hi> (Prussian and other) all this while:&#x2014;but often and often the image of you, and the thought of old days between us, has risen sad upon me; and I have waited to get loose from the Nightmares to appeal to you again, to <hi rend="italic">edacious</hi> Time and you. Most likely in a couple of weeks you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have heard from me again at any rate.&#x2014; Your friends shall be welcome to me; no friend of yours can be other at any time. Nor in fact did anybody ever sent by you prove other than pleasant in this house; so pray no apologies on that small score.&#x2014; If only these Cincinnati Patricians<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Longworths.</note> can find me here when they come? For I am off to the deepest solitudes discoverable (native Scotland probably) so soon as I can shake the <pb id="pg-33-232" n="33:232"/>final tag-rags of Printer people off me;&#x2014;&#x201C;surely within three weeks now!&#x201C; I say to myself. But I shall be back, too, if all prosper; and your Longworthys<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> will be back; and Madam will stand to her point, I hope.</p>
<p>That Book on Friedrich of Prussia,&#x2014;first <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of it, two swoln unlovely volumes, which treat mainly of his Father &#x26;c, and leave him at his Accession, is just getting out of my hands. One packet more of Proofs, and I have done with it,&#x2014;thanks to all the gods! No job approaching in ugliness to it was ever cut out for me; nor had I any motive to go on, except the sad negative one, &#x201C;Shall we be beaten in our old days, then?&#x201C;&#x2014; But it has thoroughly humbled me,&#x2014;trampled me down into the <hi rend="italic">mud,</hi> there to wrestle with the accumulated Stupidities of Mankind, German, English, French and other, for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> have borne a hand in these sad centuries;&#x2014;and here I emerge at last, not <hi rend="italic">killed,</hi> but almost as good. Seek not to look at the Book,&#x2014;nay in fact it is &#x201C;not to be <hi rend="italic">published</hi> till Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201C; (so the man of affairs settles with me yesterday, &#x201C;owing to the political &#x26;c, to the season&#x201C; &#x26;c); my only stipulation was that in ten days I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be utterly out of it,&#x2014;not to hear of it again till the Day of Judgment, and if possible not even then!&#x2014; In fact it is a bad Book, poor, misshapen, feeble, <hi rend="italic">nearly</hi> worthless (thanks to <hi rend="italic">past</hi> generations and to me); and my one excuse is, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could not make it better, all the world having played such a game with it. Well, well!&#x2014; &#x2014; How true is that that you say about the Skater; and the writer too depending on his vehicles, on his roads, on his etceteras!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote: &#x201C;Every writer is a skater who must go partly where he would, &#x26; partly where the skates carry him, or a sailor who can only land where sails can be safely blown. The variations to be allowed for in the surveyor&#x2019;s compass are nothing like so large as those that must be allowed for in every book&#x201C; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 521).</note> Dismally true have I a thousand times felt it, in these late operations; never in any so much. And in short the business of writing has altogether become contemptible to me; and I am become confirmed in the notion that nobody ought to write,&#x2014;unless sheer Fate force him to do it;&#x2014;and then he ought (if <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of the mountebank genus) to beg to be shot rather.

 <ps><p>If you read the Newspapers (which I carefully abstain from doing) they will babble to you about Dickens: &#x201C;Separation from Wife&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c: fact of Separat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (Lawyer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Deed</hi> &#x26;c) I believe is true; but all the rest is mere lies and nonsense. No crime or misdemeanor specifiable on either side: <hi rend="italic">unhappy</hi> together these good many years past, and they at length end it.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dickens had separated from his wife, Catherine, early <date when="1858-05-00">May</date>, and suggested that she should set up home elsewhere, on the grounds that the marriage had been &#x201C;for years and years as miserable a one as ever was made&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 8:558). Catherine Dickens signed the legal settlement, <date when="1858-06-04">4 June</date>, and it was finalized, <date when="1858-06-12">12 June</date>. She was to receive &#xa3;600 per annum, and to move to 70 Gloucester Ter., Regent&#x2019;s Park, with her eldest son. The other children (to whom she was to have free access) were to remain with their father. Dickens had hoped to keep the separation a private matter, but during the last two weeks of <date when="1858-05-00">May</date>, while efforts were made to draw up the deed of separation, rumors circulated that Dickens wanted the separation because he was having affairs with an actress, Ellen Ternan (<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1914-00-00">1914</date>), and his sister-in-law, Georgina Hogarth (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1917-00-00">1917</date>). In a letter, <date when="1858-05-26">26 May</date>, to his public readings&#x2019; manager, Arthur Smith (<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>; <ref target="volume-33/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25776"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Dickens enclosed a statement (later known as the ldquo;Violated Letter&#x201C;) that denied the rumors and implied, without naming them, that his mother-in-law, Georgina Thomson Hogarth (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), and his younger sister-in-law, Helen Hogarth (<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">1890</date>), were the source of the slander (see <hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 8:740&#x2013;41). Smith, in accordance with Dickens&#x2019;s wishes, attempted to exonerate him by circulating the letter amongst friends and acquaintances (see <hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 8:568), but the rumors continued. Against the advice of several friends, Dickens decided to publish a rebuttal in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> (<date when="1858-06-07">7 June</date>) and in <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> (<date when="1858-06-12">12 June</date>) (see <hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 8:744&#x2013;45). TC must have known of Dickens&#x2019;s plan because it was not until after the statement&#x2019;s publication that the scandal was reported in the press (see K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Dickens and the Hogarth Scandal,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth-Century Fiction</hi> 10 [<date when="1955-00-00">1955</date>]: 71<hi rend="italic">&#x2014;</hi>73 and Peter Ackroyd, <hi rend="italic">Dickens</hi> [<date when="1990-00-00">1990</date>] 818<hi rend="italic">&#x2014;</hi>19). As TC predicted, the reports were grossly inaccurate.

      <hi rend="small-caps">Dear Mr. Woolner,</hi>
    </salute>
    <p>I was very vexed, in fact savage at finding your card again! It was such an unlikely accident my being out that day! My husband, having no proof-sheets on hand, was suddenly struck with my &#x0201C;thinness&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;paleness&#x0201D; and decided on taking me &#x0201C;a few miles on a railway to try if that would put any life into me!&#x0201D; and we were away <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> when you called.</p>
    <p>As to Farringford<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Isle of Wight, where the Tennysons had lived since <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>. Emily Tennyson had presumably invited JWC to Farringford through Woolner after he wrote to her reporting on JWC&#x02019;s health; he first wrote, <date when="1858-03-11">11 March</date>: &#x0201C;I went and saw the immortal Thomas and his wife the other evening: I am happy to say she is getting thro&#x02019; this winter far better than she did the last. &#x02026; He&#x02014;the grim one&#x02014;was almost pleased for he has nearly completed his 2 first Vols. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick&#x0201D;</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Woolner</hi> 145). But he then reported, <date when="1858-04-02">2 April</date>: &#x0201C;I called and saw Mrs. Carlyle and am sorry to say that she looks most dreadfully ill: she had got through the winter very well until two warm days ago when she was tempted by the genial air to go out of doors for ten minutes each day and doing so gave her fresh cold. She feels it irksome to remain in so long having been shut up for twelve weeks: she looks worn and sad, I did not see the grim man, but he is I believe pretty well and hard at work bringing his first 2 vols. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> to a close&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Woolner</hi> 146&#x02013;47).</note> I need no <hi rend="italic">representations</hi> to make me feel its desirableness! The idea of being <hi rend="italic">in the country with the Tennysons</hi> is quite tempting enough; independent of &#x0201C;beauty of scenery&#x0201D; etc. etc.! But till Mr. C. is gone to Scotland, and has settled <hi rend="italic">his</hi> further plans, it is no use, I know, entertaining a plan of my own. There is talk of my meeting him in Yorkshire and in various parts of Great Britain! I must just wait till I know if I am <hi rend="italic">wanted,</hi> before I think about what I wish.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Woolner wrote to Emily Tennyson, <date when="1858-06-07">7 June</date>, apologizing for not having written sooner; he had been waiting for JWC&#x02019;s answer to the invitation to Farringford, going to Chelsea twice unsuccessfully; he enclosed JWC&#x02019;s refusal but asked: &#x0201C;[P]lease send it back for I never like to destroy her letters&#x02014;unless, of course, you wish to keep it. You will see the mighty man of genius is not so easily managed as a pet bird. I think if he could see his wife&#x02019;s weak state so keenly as he can spiritual truths, he would not let his plans interfere with her little projects for health-seeking.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I sent away the last Proof Slips of <hi rend="italic">Friedrich;</hi> my work in them all done: they will come back as <hi rend="italic">revises</hi> probably on Friday; and, at the end of this week, the long sorrow I have had with that business will be ended&#x2014;thank Heaven forevermore! Larkin called, one evening, with two of his maps in a beautiful state of readiness; his <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> too is well forward; and the third map (properly <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> for the other two are small and on <hi rend="italic">one</hi> leaf)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the maps of the &#x201C;Principalities of Baireuth-Anspach&#x201C; and &#x201C;Duchies of Cleve-J&#xfc;lich&#x201C; (first edn. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> 1:opp. 300; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:opp. 252). The other maps in the first edn. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> are &#x201C;Camp of Radewitz,&#x201C; 2:193; &#x201C;Journey to the Reich,&#x201C; 2:opp. 258 (fold-out map); &#x201C;C&#xfc;strin,&#x201C; 2:353; &#x201C;Philipsburg,&#x201C; 2:523; and &#x201C;Kingdom of Prussia,&#x201C; 2:opp. 694 (fold-out map showing boundaries of <date when="1740-00-00">1740</date> and <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>). See also <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570916-TC-HL-01">TC to HL, <date when="1857-09-16">16 Sept. 1857</date></ref>.</note> quite <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> for etching: I have set him off for a week on some other business of mine; but there will be no danger of his not being ready (especially if you touch him up in the interim) long weeks and months before that &#x201C;first of September,&#x201C;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">after</hi> which I hope the publication is not to be.</p>
<p>The reason of my writing today is more specially this. There will be about 700 pages in vol II, there were 630 odd in vol I; with <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> and the rest, there will be nearly 1400 pages in the two. Now I cannot but perceive that this is <pb id="pg-33-237" n="33:237"/><hi rend="italic">three</hi> volumes (good measure) instead of two; and what I propose is, That you should consider them as, in fact tho&#x2019; not in form, <hi rend="italic">three,</hi> to me and to other parties; and in short, put such a price upon them as will enable you to <hi rend="italic">pay me</hi> (for one party) as if they were actually <hi rend="italic">three.</hi> I am aware that this is contrary to the letter of our Bargain;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had mislaid the original agreement, but recalled that it stipulated the publication of two volumes of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> at &#xa3;800 for 2,000 copies; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580611-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1858-06-11">11 June</date></ref>. TC had been discussing the bargain with Chapman in early <date when="1857-05-00">May 1857</date>, when <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> was first going to press: &#x201C;I expect to have a Bargain made with Chapman in a few days&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570501-TC-JAC-01"><sic>32:137</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1857-05-01">1 May 1857</date></corr></ref>).</note> but if it be a fact that the Book has not been swollen out with surplusage or <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>working of any kind, and has <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> to <hi rend="italic">three,</hi>&#x2014;I think you will admit that it is conformable to the spirit of our Bargain;&#x2014;and that equity would grant it, tho&#x2019; law will not.</p>
<p>If you do, we can say on the titlepage &#x201C;History &#x26;c <hi rend="italic">in four volumes</hi>&#x201C;;&#x2014;and the sequel shall be (if I can live to do it) in the same size and form; <hi rend="italic">two</hi> volumes (same <hi rend="italic">price</hi> as these two). If <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> I shall in self-defense have to print the Sequel in <hi rend="italic">three</hi> Volumes (400 pages each):&#x2014;and in any case, neither this First Part nor any other shall <hi rend="italic">again</hi> be printed in fewer than three volumes;&#x2014;work to be in six volumes in all, <hi rend="italic">first edit</hi>n, in Four, if you consent to what I propose; and in Five, if the contrary, which I will not anticipate.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a previous discussion with Chapman about the vol. numbers, see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570707-TC-EC-01"><sic>32:172&#x2013;73</sic><corr>TC to EC, <date when="1857-07-07">7 July 1857</date></corr></ref>. The number of vols. pbd. in <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date> remained at two; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571025-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1857-10-25">25 Oct. 1857</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>As to the letter of the Bond, I need not repeat, there can be no disputing. But as to the real equity and intrinsic purport of it,&#x2014;I have had this notion in my head, during these late weeks since I had more leisure to consider; and I could not but decide on formally making the proposal before winding up. Pray consider it, too, from my point of view; and answer when you have settled. I shall not be off for a week or so,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; truly there ought to be no loitering in such weather as we have&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours always truly</salute></closer></p>

<p>As it was you that beneficcently<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> made the Bargain with Chapman for me (an action that will be marked in the credit side of your account in all places of this universe) I am bound, were I even not desirous, to shew you the enclosed Letter, and its proposed modifications, before it get farther.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580609-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1858-06-09">9 June</date></ref>.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Many kind thanks to you: they are right well due! I might have anticipated, tho&#x2019; I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not allow myself, that you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take this course, regardless of the new trouble for my behoof. Of course I, but too willingly, leave the whole matter with you; and can now, in a composed spirit, wash my hands of it; not to hear of it again till it is a matter <hi rend="italic">settled.</hi></p>
<p>To make things complete I intended to send you the Original Document; which lies safe, docketed &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Bargain for Fr</hi>h,&#x201C; somewhere: but alas I have laid it up too well and not wisely;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 5.2.</note> an hour and half of diligent search yields me only dusty hands, headache, and even heartache, this hot morning; and I had to give it up! I never saw the Paper since that sunday you gave it me long ago; I imagined it lay ready as a pocket-whistle; but it is hidden somewhere to be out of the smoke-atmosphere,&#x2014;too well.</p>
<p>My recollection of it is distinct, to this effect: &#x201C;For two volumes of a <hi rend="italic">Life of Fr</hi>h, &#xa3;800 2,000 Copies to be printed: volumes <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be above 400 pages each;&#x2014;or if they were (said a kind of Codicil) Mr Ch<hi rend="italic">n</hi> was to have &#x201C;liberty to put on an additional price,&#x201C;&#x2014;natural &#x201C;price&#x201C; (if <hi rend="italic">not</hi> above 400 pages) was not hinted at, so far as I remember.&#x2014; This I believe to be the authentic substance of the Document; and you can act upon this as if it were the Document itself;&#x2014;and upon the whole settle the matter for me (any time before Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1st) as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find to be feasible and equitable.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2. The vols. (20s. each; see <ref target="volume-32/ed-32-athanaeum-advertisements"><sic>32:221</sic><corr>Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s Advertisements</corr></ref>) earned TC &#xa3;2,800 by the end of <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>, according to <hi rend="italic">ODNB.</hi></note> And add a new entry to your <pb id="pg-33-239" n="33:239"/>Credit Account in this bewildered universe (Debtor I, and perhaps Other Parties abler to pay than I)!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On Monday week I am partly aiming to go. Of course I shall see you before.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I thought this had been Friday; but it seems indisputably to be <hi rend="italic">Saturday;</hi> so that your Post will lose a day: however, I had better write at once, best <pb id="pg-33-240" n="33:240"/>before <hi rend="italic">two.</hi> I am got out under my awning again (begirt with <hi rend="italic">pianos</hi> and other mad discords, mostly <hi rend="italic">voluntaries</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is the aggravating feature of them)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Arthur Hamilton Morse, the piano teacher at 8 Cheyne Row.</note>: I cannot now write at all upstairs without stupefaction and headache soon coming on.</p>
<p>My Book is at last actually done;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">last</hi> revise (sheet and half), a mere formal matter, will probably come tonight; I put the <hi rend="italic">dates</hi> upon the margin of it, see if Chorley<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Rutter Chorley.</note> has any remarks (Chorley has read all the final proofs, and is occasionally of profit in his lynx-eyed way): that over, we are fairly at &#x201C;end of vol II&#x201C;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi></note>&#x2014;and anything farther can be settled from any <hi rend="italic">distance</hi> I may be at, by aid of Rowl<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Hill.</p>
<p>The question now is, How to get my Horse and self carried into Annandale <hi rend="italic">qu&#xE0;m prim&#xf9;m</hi> [as soon as possible]? In my horror at railways, I have tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I might so time it as to get to Liverpool in the right hour, and then take the Annan Steamer to conclude with. I remember you spoke once of a certain <hi rend="italic">day</hi> in the week in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the Steamer homewards was nearly empty. Is that still so? I tried it, then, I remember; and took the <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> day,&#x2014;with penalties duly following.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500828-TC-JWC-01"><sic>25:177</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1850-08-28">28 Aug. 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> If you can give me as clear a chance again (hour, day &#x26;c), I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> endeavour to conform more faithfully. In the course of next week (say this day week or the Monday following), I might be ready; and cut myself loose from this unpleasant element one good time.</p>
<p>Jane is a little better than when I wrote last; but still as weak as need be. She does not yet decide positively on anything: but, I think, will be likely to follow me to Scotland, in not many weeks. There is small temptation to stay here, in our circumstances; the blessing of clean air to breathe, and some kind of silence to live in, are not denied, however ma[n]y<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> others are. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Tingrrr, tangrr!</hi>&#x201C; so my poor Lady neighbour (&#x2018;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 9&#x2019; they say)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a female relative of John Webber, who lived at 9 Cheyne Row.</note> salutes the blessed Noon; a male young friend<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> with an accordion and open window still nearer, is (happily for me, not for him poor soul) fallen sick and therefore silent.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>My Book is utterly off my hand for some days past; but the getting into my promised condition of &#x201C;rest&#x201C; seems to be as laborious as most other parts of the operation were!

I have been to the Steam Officers here, to Euston Square itself: but in place of decision new complications have risen. The <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> is a considerable element of bother; for (as you will soon see) I hardly know whither to address him as matters have come to stand. At Euston Square, &#x2018;6.15 any morning, and no other time,&#x2019; they will push him off for Carlisle (fare &#xa3;4.2), and land him <hi rend="italic">there</hi> (ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 7.30 p.m. if I recollect),&#x2014;and are &#x2018;certain&#x2019; to push him by the very next <hi rend="italic">horse</hi>-opportunity towards Annan (or Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> if that is a <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> station, as Cummertrees<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Railway station nr. the Gill.</note> is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>):&#x2014;I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> send him off at once by this method, if my own route could be determined on;&#x2014;nay perhaps I shall have to do so, determined or not.</p>
<p>But the truth is, Jane&#x2019;s state of weakness &#x26; discomfort in this broil of hot confusions is such, we have taken a notion of trying for some quiet house or hut somewhere on the sea-shore; and certain &#x201C;Dunlops,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >3.

Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has considerably taken poor Jane&#x2019;s fancy, and even my own. So that at present my belief is, I ought to go northw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> that way, and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it (and try to decide upon it) as I pass. After wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> in case of <hi rend="italic">affirmative,</hi> Jane w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> immediately gather herself, and go off with her little maid<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Southam.</note> to furnish (slightly), and take possession till the Sun had fairly <hi rend="italic">ended</hi> his year&#x2019;s operations.

This is one of the great invitations of the place: it is described to us also as grassy, hilly, romantically beautiful, and <hi rend="italic">deserted</hi> by railways;&#x2014;plenty of milk in it (we hope), and the other <hi rend="italic">naturalia</hi> desired by sane mankind. I believe I ought to go and see it. It seems to be about 50 or 40 miles s. of Newcastle, and very accessible from Annandale. In case of our going thither to live<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS NLS 525.39 ends here.</note> <hi rend="italic">live,</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC writes &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">live&#x201C;</hi> at the start of MS NLS 518.80.</note> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not send my horse to Anna[n]dale<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> at all; but come across for a week or two, while Jane were getting ready at Lythe, and see my friends in the pedestrian way.</p>
<p>At all events it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a deliverance to have my horse off my hands for the time being! I proposed lending him to Farie to ride for a month: poor Farie, I perceive, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get on fire to be <hi rend="italic">off</hi> into the Country at once, had he such a tie on him,&#x2014;without tie, he will not go for perhaps 2 months yet. So that comes to nothing Nay the horse is not perfectly <hi rend="italic">well</hi> (in my opinion); idleness and <hi rend="italic">grass</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> perhaps suit him better for a few weeks.

<p>Do not come to us till Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g:</hi> we go out of Town tomorrow (Saturday) morning, and do not return till Monday.</p>
<p>Here in the meanwhile are two <hi rend="italic">Railway Problems,</hi> of which if you could work out the solution I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be much obliged:</p>

<p>2<hi rend="italic">&#xB0;</hi>. What from Newcastle (southward) to the same Whitby?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw&#x2019;s,</hi> it was necessary to travel to Hull to get from Newcastle to Whitby on the Yorkshire to Preston line (dep. 8:20 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.,</hi> arr. 10:40 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>) and then change to one of the above trains on the Liverpool to Manchester line.</note>&#x2014; To wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> if you like you may add this <hi rend="italic">third,</hi></p>
<p>3<hi rend="italic">&#xB0;</hi>. What are the Trains from London to Whitby?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The train from London to Whitby listed in <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw&#x2019;s</hi> was on the Northeast line, dep. 11:00 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> and arr. 9:15 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi></note> (There are return tickets and grand &#x201C;excursions&#x201C; thither,&#x2014;flamingly advertised,&#x2014;but I as yet know only the <hi rend="italic">prices</hi>).</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many thanks for the elegant volume you have sent me entitled contributions to medical literature:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A Contribution to Medical Literature</hi> (<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>).</note> which arrived 3 or 4 days ago; and the greater part of which, to my own astonishment I have already read with real pleasure and instruction during what leisure there has been. With the technicalities I endeavour to make shift: and in the general strain of the discourse there is so much candour, ingenuity lucidity, &#x26; in fine so much humour sense and gracefulness, that I have been led along as I say; and indeed there appears to me a likelihood that all the house will read this volume, and be benifited by so doing.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rutherfurd Russell condemned &#x201C;the total absence of philosophical discernment displayed by those who are now appointed guardians of medicine&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">A Contribution,</hi> 2). He stressed the importance and superiority of the homoeopathic approach: &#x201C;[T]he less the ailing body is tormented with drugs, and the more it is helped by a nice selection of proper food, the sooner and the safer will its health and strength be restored&#x201C; (167). He paid tribute to Samuel Brown (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>; <ref target="volume-33/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3649"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560823-JWC-TC-01"><sic>31:190</sic><corr>JWC to TC <date when="1856-08-23">23 Aug. 1856</date></corr></ref>) and referred to TC&#x2019;s admiration for Brown. Apparently TC wrote to a friend about it: &#x201C;Very wise, candid, good, in fact a nice bit of reading, even to the non-medical&#x201C; (D. M., <hi rend="italic">Memoir of the Late Dr. Rutherford Russell</hi> [<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>] 14). For TC and JWC on homoeopathy, see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350323-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:79</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-03-23">23 March 1835</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410828-JWC-JF-01"><sic>13:231</sic><corr>JWC to JF, [<date when="1841-08-28">28 Aug. 1841</date>]</corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580326-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1858-03-26">26 March</date></ref>.</note> I am much gratified by such a gift from you, precious <pb id="pg-33-247" n="33:247"/>both intrinsically &#x26; otherwise. I saw your brother<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Russell (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>), a qualified doctor who did not practice; he lived at Gadgirth, Ayrshire.</note> not very long since; but it is many a year since you have made appearance here! If ever you are in town<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>, Russell moved to 3 Harley St., Cavendish Sq.; he practiced in Leamington before London, so possibly was still living in Leamington at this time.</note> why not make an attempt on Chelsea too, so long as I am forthcoming?</p>
<p>I have been for the last two years, &#x26; indeed for many years previous overwhelmed in such a chaos of contemptible rubbish (Prussian sand, great part of it) as I never had to deal with in my life before. Many a time I have thought I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never get out of it alive Nevertheless, by the bounty of Heaven, here I am, got to a kind of actual Halfway House and fairly at liberty to run to Scotland for a little rest in these very sultry days, which is extremely needful to me, as matters stand. <closer><salute>With many thanks &#x26; regards I am always yours truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I turned out my horse to grass at Richmond, friday last; and there he goes with the shoes off him, much more to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> mind than I am to mine. The Lythe speculation is utterly given up,&#x2014;roads to and from being so untowardly. There was a new project started in reference to a Cottage at Brighton (or Rottingdean, near it). But that, if anything is to come of that, will be looked into by Jane more at leisure when I am gone.</p>
<p>In fine I decide to cut loose, and have a glimpse of Annandale, and what kindred I have still loving me,&#x2014;the first of all the things I do. And I have written to Mary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Austin at the Gill.</note> that I set off Tomorrow Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> 8.45 (Mail Train) for Carlisle direct, and am to be expected at Cummertrees (I suppose, but have no table to tell me) some time about 8 or 9 on Thursday morning. I believe I ought not to stay long: but we shall see as to that. For the present this is all my news.</p>
<p>Henry Watt came to me last night; and is to return North straightway,&#x2014;as he has no doubt told you. Looking stout and hearty. Kindest regards to Jamie &#x26; Isabella.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Amid the agonies of packing, I write a word of thanks to you. I am heartily your debtor for settling that point to me as you have done; the blessing of one altogether wearied out of his life be upon you for that same!</p>
<p>If the Original Document (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I never glanced at since the day you gave it me) said &#x201C;500 pages&#x201C; for Maximum, as your Letter of last night does, instead of &#x201C;400&#x201C; as I had vaguely remembered,&#x2014;then this new Covenant is nearly altogether what it even by theory ought to have been: but however that may be, and all other things may be, most surely I accept what you have done as the very best that could practically be done to me, and will with gratitude to F. conform to it in every particular. So that, having put your Note in the Archives here (<hi rend="italic">discoverable</hi> at once we will hope!), I dismiss the matter entirely from my mind, and till October arrive, shall instead of an arithmetical-commercial imbroglio, retain merely a pleasant tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Forster and human help in that corner of my memory. More is the praise to Forster; may his shadow never be less!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., may he always remain robust and prosperous.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I lost my Horse (sent him out to grass<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Richmond.</note> with shoes off) the day after I wrote last; more than once has my walk pointed toward M<hi rend="italic">ue</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Montague.</note> Square: but alas&#x2014;!&#x2014; I go tonight, for Carlisle and across the Border by the Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> Mail Train (8.45); shall, by tomorrow morning, be out of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> thrice-infernal element, into <hi rend="italic">another</hi> better or worse. Italian Organ-boys, tepid dirtyish water, stinking river, stinking Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and some other particulars,&#x2014;the pressure of <hi rend="italic">these</hi> will at least be exchanged for that of others. I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to go to Germany: but, alas, I dare not think of it at present.</p>
<p>My Wife continues still a little while; will perhaps follow <hi rend="italic">northward,</hi>&#x2014;must somehow get out of Town,&#x2014;in a week or two.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear Forster;&#x2014; condole with poor Macready;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Macready&#x2019;s da. Lydia Jane (JWC&#x2019;s godchild), d. <date when="1858-06-20">20 June</date> of scarlet fever, age 16.

<p><salute>Well, my dear little Jeannie,</salute> here I am; safe, and with less suffering than I anticipated: nothing went awry of all the arrangements; not the smallest ill accident befel. My chief suffering was from <hi rend="italic">dust;</hi> foul air I overcame by addressing, at the very first pulling up of the <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> window, a forcible bit of familiar eloquence to the gentleman active: &#x201C;How he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to have his neighbour&#x2019;s dirty <hi rend="italic">shirt</hi> offered him to wear? Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was a clean transaction in comparison&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c. So that they at least let me keep down my own window, and even kept down theirs (poor souls) in whole or in part almost the whole night. We were <hi rend="italic">five,</hi> mostly fat: but these arrangements secured air, tho&#x2019; with a painful admixture of dust and engine smoke. Except myself the poor souls (Glasgow bodies mostly) fell sound asleep in an hour or two; and word of speech to me ward there was none,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; perfect good nature mixed with apprehension, as I judged.&#x2014; About midnight I changed my waistcoat for a warmer; &#x26; took out the supper provided me by my poor considerate little Goody. It was an excellent device: I ate the most of what was; &#x26; took out the second and last draught of drink at Lancaster<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >City 230 mi. NW of London.</note> shortly before sunrise. Some winks of sleep I had too, tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">stoppages</hi> always awoke me again. In fine, Carlisle, thro&#x2019; a beautiful bright and breezy morning (rather cool even) a little before six: cigar there, hardly finished, when we started again; and at 7, the face of Austin with a Gig, met me at Cummertrees; and within half an hour more I was busy washing here, &#x26; about to fall upon breakfast in my old quarters.</p>
<p>I have had coffee of prime quality; been out strolling to smoke a pipe, &#x26; returned with my feet wet (having plunked into a hidden bit of quagmire, stupidly enough): this is yet all that I have <hi rend="italic">done;</hi>&#x2014;and I propose next to put on my dressing-gown &#x26; fairly lie down in quest of a sleep. This will probably be gone before I awake again: but indeed what news can there well be in the interim from a man in his sleep?&#x2014; &#x2014; I find there is not likely to be the least shadow of a horse for riding here; so I believe I shall really have to send for my own. But we may pause till we have <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> upon that.&#x2014; Oh my dear one friendkin (what other have I left really?),&#x2014;I was truly <hi rend="italic">wae</hi> to leave thee yesternight. You did not go <hi rend="italic">away</hi> either: I saw you, and held up my finger almost at the very last. Don&#x2019;t bother yourself writing me a long letter: a very <pb id="pg-33-250" n="33:250"/>short one, if it only tell me you begin to profit by being left alone, will be abundantly welcome. <closer><salute>Adieu, Dearest;&#x2014;I even think of Nero the wretch. Ever yours</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>There is nothing whatever to hinder me from sending you this poor sprig of Annandale Heath, plucked this morning, for a token; it is the one <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> I undertake by way of external history for this my second Day here; said Day w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> otherwise be flat <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> in the record. I am perfectly alone; nothing round me but the grey winds, and the abyss of <hi rend="small-caps">time</hi>, Past, Present, Future: a whole Sanhedrin, or loudly debating Parliament (so to speak), of <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> and Ghosts is assembled round me,&#x2014;sad, very sad of tone, in the mind&#x2019;s ear; but not unprofitable either: a little <hi rend="italic">live</hi> Note to Goody will be a comfort to myself, and no displeasure to Nero and her, over the tea tomorrow morn<hi rend="italic">g.</hi></p>
<p>Yesterday I had hardly finished when there came to Mary a Note from John, intimating that Jamie and he were on the road hither to see me; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> direct, by walking a few miles; Jamie to rejoin him here in the gig, after Annan market, &#x2018;about 5 p.m.&#x2019;&#x2014; Being very sleepy I decided for bed nevertheless; flung myself down in dressing gown &#x26;c, and had hardly done so (as was afterwards evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) when poor Jack arrived; but had to wait 4&#xBD; hours, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he did patiently till I woke again. Did not see me till dinner ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 4 p.m.; had sauntered about,&#x2014;and himself dined &#x201C;on rice and milk&#x201C; in the interim. Poor soul, he was very friendly; grown sensibly <hi rend="italic">whiter</hi> (indeed he is quite hoary, with skin <hi rend="italic">reddish</hi>); otherwise quite well, and making not the least complaint of men or things. He told me much about the Commercial <hi rend="italic">Nephews</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Aitken and James Carlyle.</note> (Jamie Aitken at Liverpool a wearisome story), about &#x201C;D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Arnott<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Francis S.

A more frank exposition of my feelings could not have been made!</p>
<p>Tait bore all meekly; only his face in a white heat!&#x2014;for he felt conscious of fault in the business&#x2014;but not the fault we had imputed to him. Here is the way in which the thing happened, (he solemnly assured me&#x2014;offering proof of Combe&#x2019;s letter)&#x2014;</p>
<p>Tait took Combe and his Wife to the Exhibition<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The summer exhibition of the Royal Academy. Cecilia Combe, b. Siddons (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>); she was the da. of the actress Sarah Siddons (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>) and had a fortune of &#xa3;15,000.

From the Academy the female Combe and Tait drove to the Royal Institution,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At 21 Albermarle St.</note> dropping the male Combe at Sir James Clark&#x2019;s,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Clark<sic>e</sic> (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>; <ref target="volume-33/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5463"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380830-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:159</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-08-30">30 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540418-JWC-JAC-01"><sic>29:68</sic><corr>JWC to JAC, <date when="1854-04-18">18 April 1854</date></corr></ref>), Queen Victoria&#x2019;s physician.</note> where he was engaged to lunch, and where he found himself sitting next Lord Ashburton. Of course he began talking of the academy pictures he had just come from, and, with pure zeal of friendship, mentioned with special approbation <hi rend="italic">The Chelsea Interior</hi>&#x2014; &#x201C;Ah! said Lord A, listening with a pleased look: I <hi rend="italic">rather think</hi> that picture belongs to <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> I said I should be glad to buy it of the artist&#x2014; Pray if he is a friend of yours, tell him I understand the picture to be <hi rend="italic">mine,</hi> and will thank him to let me know its price.&#x201C;&#x2014; Now, really that sounds very like Lord A!&#x2014;carried away by the impulse of the moment&#x2014;pleased to say <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was possessor of a picture the person <hi rend="italic">next him</hi> was praising!&#x2014;and so far poor Tait was blameless&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">He</hi> (Tait) next dropt M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Combe at Sir James who went to Lord A open-mouthed about a beautiful Leonardo da Vinci of his, at the Royal Institution&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh, said he, if you like pictures pray come to Bath House tomorrow morning, your husband and you, and look at my collection which is thought good:&#x2014;and <pb id="pg-33-256" n="33:256"/>bring with you the artist who has painted the <hi rend="italic">Chelsea Interior!</hi>&#x2014;and dont, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Combe, forget my message to him about the picture being mine&#x2014; All this is really very Lord-Ashburtonish!</p>
<p>&#x201C;You seriously mean me to tell M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Tait you take the picture at his own price?&#x201C; asked Combe, like a discreet Scotchman&#x2014; &#x201C;Certainly Certainly&#x201C;&#x2014; So next morning Tait received a letter from Combe to this purport&#x2014;which he will show me, he says,&#x2014;</p>
<p>What Tait regrets is, that Lord A&#x2014; never having heard the price of the picture, may have bought it dearer than he likes&#x2014; For Tait himself considers the price a sort of fancy one&#x2014;put on it &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">to prevent it falling into vulgar hands</hi>&#x201C; (as he wrote to Lord A). He would really have taken off a hundred or two, I think, if it had not been &#x201C;for the honour of the thing&#x201C;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the price being <hi rend="italic">set down</hi> 500 in the Catalogue, Lord A <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have known it from the beginning, had he liked&#x2014; I believe it was from Tait himself Lord A got the idea that the price was high! wonderful Lord A! at all events it was Tait&#x2019;s conscience about the <hi rend="italic">price</hi> that made him take my rating so meekly!&#x2014; In token of recantation of my rancours against him, I have accepted, after some resistance, his escort to Rottingdean<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rottingdean, village nr.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>It is so long since I wrote, and I have been so bothered and bewildered in the interval; that I cant recollect whether it is your turn or my own to write! But whosever turn it is, the silence is equally needing to be broken! and if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am the delinquent, I can only say, I have had plenty of excuse for all my sins of ommission of late weeks. First, my Dear, the <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> has really been nearer killing me than the cold&#x2014;London heat!&#x2014;nobody knows what <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is till having tried it! so breathless and sickening, and oppressive as no other heat I ever experienced! Then the quantities of visitors rushing about me at this season, complicated by an influx of <hi rend="italic">cousins,</hi> to be entertained on special terms, have taken out in talk my dregs of strength and spirit! Then M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, in the collapse from the strain of his book, and the biliousness developed by the heat, has been so wild to &#x201C;get away&#x201C; and so incapable of determining where to go and when to go! that living beside him has been like living the life of a weathercock in a high wind, blowing from all points at once, <hi rend="italic">sensibility</hi> superadded! So long at least as he involved <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in his &#x201C;dissolving views&#x201C;! The imaginary houses in different parts of the Kingdom, in which I have had to look round me on bare walls, and apply my fancy to <hi rend="italic">furnishing; with the strength I have</hi> (!)&#x2014;(about equal to my canary&#x2019;s, which, every now and then, drops off the perch on its back and has to be lifted up!)&#x2014;would have driven me crazy I think, if one day I hadn&#x2019;t got desperate and burst out <hi rend="italic">crying!!</hi> Until a woman <hi rend="italic">cries,</hi> Men never think she can be suffering! Bless their blockheadism! However when I <hi rend="italic">cried,</hi> and declared I was not strong enough for all that any more; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C opened his eyes to the fact so far, as to decide that for the present he would go to his Sister&#x2019;s (the Gill) and let me choose my own course after&#x2014; And to the Gill he went last Wednesday night, and since then I have been <hi rend="italic">resting</hi>&#x2014;and already feel better for the rest, even <hi rend="italic">without</hi> &#x201C;change of air&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>What my own course will be, I havn&#x2019;t a notion! The main point in my system of <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> is, to postpone not only all doing, but all making up my mind to do! to, reduce myself as much as possible to a state of vacant, placid idiocy! <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the state, I am sure, a judicious Doctor would recommend for the moment! When the time comes for <hi rend="italic">wishing</hi> for change and action, it will be time to decide where to go&#x2014; Meanwhile I shall see what being <hi rend="italic">well let alone</hi> will do for my health! All the cousins are gone now,&#x2014; The visitors going&#x2014;no <pb id="pg-33-258" n="33:258"/>household cares! (&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cares of bread</hi>&#x201C; as Mazzini calls them!) For, with no Husband to <hi rend="italic">study,</hi> house keeping is mere play&#x2014;and my young maid is a jewel of a creature! It seems to me the best chance I have had for picking up a little strength this good while!</p>
<p>I suppose you will be having my Aunt Anne<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Welsh.</note> again soon. I hear from them very seldom. I should like so much, if I could be set down there in &#x201C;the Princess of China&#x2019;s&#x201C; &#x201C;flying bed,&#x201C; or on &#x201C;Prince Houssans&#x201C; &#x201C;flying carpet,&#x201C; to land at Thornhill, before the fine weather end&#x2014;but the length of journey by rail terrifies me! especially the length of the journey <hi rend="italic">back!</hi> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Pringle, recently widowed.</note> I dare say, <hi rend="italic">half</hi> expects me to visit <hi rend="italic">her</hi> in August&#x2014;for I have never said <hi rend="italic">positively</hi> I would <hi rend="italic">not</hi>&#x2014;and she has pressed my coming most kindly&#x2014; But to say where I will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go, would require consideration and decision, as well as saying where I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go&#x2014; And, as I have said, I mean to be an idiot for a time, post-poning all mental effort!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Do write to me&#x2014; I dont feel to know about you at all&#x2014; love to the Doctor&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Here is an ingenuous-looking young man who applies to me on a subject I can give him no good guidance in.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. Russell had applied for a professorship at Poona Coll., later Deccan Coll., founded in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date> as a combination of Poona Sanskrit Coll. and Poona English School. He had written to TC from Oxford; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580625-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-06-25">25 June</date>]</ref>. Possibly the Rev. Edward Grant Russell (ca. <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1883-00-00">83</date>), son of Charles Dupr&#xE9; Russell of Bengal, India; matr. Oxford, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>, B.A., <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, and M.A., <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>; later curate of Kenton, nr. Exeter. It is not known if he was related to John Rutherfurd Russell. Mill replied, <date when="1858-07-08">8 July</date>: &#x201C;Mr. Russell, the young man who wrote to you about the Poona Professorship, called on me the day after I received your note. He seemed a reasonable and modest person enough, but with rather vague notions about the nature of the information he was in quest of. I was able however to give him some particulars about the prospects of personal advancement, and the general eligibility of the position of a teacher of Hindoos. I also recommended to him such books as I thought most worth his reading. / You are well out of dusty London at this season; though we by no means find it necessary to go so far as Annan for the calm and silence you speak of. We have a quiet corner down here, where we shall be at any time happy to see you&#x201C; (MS: NLS 615.472a).</note> As it lies partly in your department, and your old Humanity is still memorable to me, I consider it possible you might consent to invest half an hour (not more) of your time, were it even Official time, in this speculation, of a young inquiring spirit and his bit of &#x201C;progress in life,&#x201C; all-important to himself at least! Upon such chance I have ventured to advise his making an attempt upon you (&#x201C;middle of the day, Wednesday next, Examiner Office,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At India House, where Mill worked as examiner.</note> for half an hour&#x201C;); but if you cannot receive him, <pb id="pg-33-260" n="33:260"/>refuse without scruple, for I have marked it as extremely uncertain,&#x2014;to make the disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> less, if not the pleasure greater.</p>
<p>I have taken refuge here, out of the quasi-infernal London element, for a few weeks: one of the nearest approaches I can make to a practical <hi rend="italic">Ramadhan,</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The ninth month of the Islamic calendar, during which the Koran was revealed, observed by Muslims with fasting, abstinence, and prayer.</note> or month of (modern) Silence and Prayer, with the accompaniment of clean air, limpid water, and an old scene every square yard of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is familiar to me, and the entire populations of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are <hi rend="italic">new,</hi> and do not know Joseph any more.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Exod. 1:8.</note> I often think, if you were in the next cottage, half a mile of[f],<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> what discoursings we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> still have, in front of the ancient Selgovian Sea,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Solway Firth.

<p><name>T.

<p>Thanks for your good little Note, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> lay waiting for me at the due hour, on Saturday morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> when I returned from my &#x201C;first smoke&#x201C; and stroll amid the breezy furze. I hope you have seen your hayfield,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580625-TC-JWC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-06-25">25 June</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580627-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-06-27">27 June</date>]</ref>.</note> poor little soul, and <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> that wiser course of existence! The one thing I objected to in your Note was that of my being &#x201C;discontented&#x201C; with you, or having ever for an instant been. <pb id="pg-33-261" n="33:261"/>Depend upon it, that is a <hi rend="italic">mistake</hi> once for all. I was indeed discontented with myself, with my hot fetid London, generally with all persons and things (and my stomach had struck work withal), but not discontented with poor <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ever at all. Nay to tell you the truth, your anger at me (grounded on that false basis) was itself sometimes a kind of comfort to me: I tho<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> &#x201C;Well, she has strength to be cross and illnatured at me; she is not all softness and affection and <hi rend="italic">weakness!</hi>&#x201C; On the whole, it will now be better. &#x201C;The cares of bread&#x201C;&#x2014;poor little being, I could both laugh and cry at the thought of such a problem laid on such a back.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here all goes on without jolt; well <hi rend="italic">enough,</hi> we may define everything to be. I find the air, the &#x26;c decidedly wholesome to me; I do my sleeping, my eating, my walking, am out all day in the open air;&#x2014;regard myself as <hi rend="italic">put in hospital</hi> decidedly on favourable terms, and nearly certain to improve daily. One of my worst wants is clothes! My thin London dress does not suit this temperature hitherto; and positively I am too shabby for shewing face on the roads at all. The excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Tailor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Garthwaite.</note> being officially here, I made him <hi rend="italic">mend</hi> my old dressing gown (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is quite a trim article again), and engaged him to come directly so soon as I had got <hi rend="italic">cloth.</hi> A new dressing-gown, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> Cape, <hi rend="italic">two</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> jackets (<hi rend="italic">like</hi> the <hi rend="italic">brown</hi> one, remnant of brown dressing-gown), <hi rend="italic">steel-grey</hi> &#x201C;Orleans stripe&#x201C; for winter trowsers; I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> even take another <hi rend="italic">winter coat,</hi> so excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the tailor, had we only cloth! In search of cloth, Jamie Austin drove me into Dumfries on that same Saturday afternoon<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1858-06-26">26 June</date>.</note> (Jean having written that she was not coming): we found Jean &#x26;c all brisk enough: but no <hi rend="italic">cloth</hi> that looked tolerable could be at once discovered there. Jean is coming out this evening, with a more deliberate set of specimens and counsels. I am not certain but I shall have to apply to Bull &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> in St Martin&#x2019;s Lane:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bull &#x26; Wilson, cloth merchants, 52 St. Martin&#x2019;s Lane, London.</note> the Cares of bread are done; but what if the &#x201C;Cares of Cloth&#x201C; start up on a poor weak creature! No, I will not, if I can help it.</p>
<p>Yesterday Jamie &#x26; the Dr came driving over,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Scotsbrig, where John A. Carlyle was staying with their brother James.</note> unexpectedly, when I was getting to employ<hi rend="italic">t</hi> after breakfast. Day not to be complained of, tho&#x2019; it went to <hi rend="italic">zero.</hi> I winded up by an immense walk; clearest air, beautifullest sunset &#x26; summer ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> I had seen for 7 years,&#x2014;lame ancle I <hi rend="italic">steeped</hi> in a burn for 5 minutes, and made it do. Growing <hi rend="italic">better</hi> rather.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today I have written to Tait; absolutely <hi rend="italic">countermanding</hi> that Picture Bargain, and requesting him to <hi rend="italic">refuse</hi> the Picture to Lord A<hi rend="italic">n,</hi>&#x2014;on the ground of &#x201C;certain whims of mine.&#x201C; I told Tait plainly (as politely as I could) what my mind &#x26; yours was. If they apply to you, stick to the same doctrine,&#x2014;and do <pb id="pg-33-262" n="33:262"/><hi rend="italic">your</hi> wisest; keeping it off <hi rend="italic">me</hi> if you can!

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>I do not remember if, while you were among us, you heard much of Mr Scott, or made any personal acquaintance with him: but the truth is, he has been conclusively known, this long while, to a select and ever-widening circle as one of the few distinguished thinkers of his time; a man of real intellect, earnestness, originality, and depth;&#x2014;prevented (or perhaps <hi rend="italic">preserved</hi>), by intricacies of position, by uncertain health, and other causes (<hi rend="italic">merits,</hi> many of them) from being known so universally as he might well one day still be, and as many persons not worth naming along with him already are, in our loud time. He by no means tells all his secrets at once; but it is certain he has his secret, many curious secrets, abstrusely wrestled for, as he came thus far; and so much as he will impart of them, I have always considered to be extremely well worth listening to, and taking with me. His utterance, by Lecture or otherwise, which the cursory hearer considers free and felicitous in a high degree, will strike the considerate ear as still more remarkable by the much it hints at as being left <hi rend="italic">un</hi>said.</p>
<p>Circumstances, of a legitimate nature, not an illegitimate as is commoner, bring him to lecture among you this Autumn; and if, by countenance, by good advice, by honest human welcome to a scene wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you know and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he does not, you can in any way smooth the road for him, I doubt not, for my sake, for his, and for your own, it will be of the nature of a pleasure to you.</p>

<p>To <hi rend="italic">all my American friends who</hi> take interest in Lecturing, I can recommend Professor A. J. Scott, as a man of dignified serious character and manners; possessing high intellectual gifts, matured by study, consciencious experience, <pb id="pg-33-263" n="33:263"/>and earnest meditation on the facts of this world, to a degree far beyond common in our time. Of his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the Age of Dante</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> testimonial for Scott (see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480921-TC-CUCL-01"><sic>23:116</sic><corr>TC to CUCL, <date when="1848-09-21">21 Sept. 1848</date></corr></ref>) had mentioned Scott&#x2019;s thorough study of Dante. Scott had lectured on Dante at the Manchester Athenaeum, <date when="1858-09-00">Sept.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-10-00">Oct. 1847</date>. His <hi rend="italic">Notes of Four Lectures on the Literature and Philosophy of the Middle Ages</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>) was printed for private circulation; the first and third lectures alluded to Dante, and the second focused upon Dante&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Divina Commedia</hi>, especially the <hi rend="italic">Purgatorio</hi>.</note> I have heard much admiration expressed by persons of judgement; and I myself, by long acquaintance, know Mr Scott to be a man extremely well worth hearing on any subject he undertakes to discourse of.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Scott,</salute>ndash;It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give me pleasure to help in this American Enterprise; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I perceive to be a very rational one. Unhappily I am in a kind of abeyance with the vocal public of that country; and have not for years answered a Letter if by chance some Letter still came, nor had the least correspondence with anybody in that country,&#x2014;except (and that a very little) with Emerson alone. The fact, I suppose is, there are still many people well affected to me; but they have the dignity to hold their tongue in the presence of such unmusical infinitude of balderdash from other parties:&#x2014;that is the sad lot of a literary man and his real friends and hearers in these times.&#x2014; Taking the fact on such footing as it is pleased to have, I send you the two inclosed Papers;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><ref target="volume-33/lt-18580630-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1858-06-30">30 June</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580630-TC-AMFR-01">TC to <sic>American friends</sic><corr>AMFR</corr>, <date when="1858-06-30">30 June</date></ref>, were probably written before this letter.</note> and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> gladly have done better, had I been able.</p>

I shall think it a pity if you have not made known your purpose to him: if it will at all help to say that I advised you,&#x2014;well perhaps it may be better not!</p>
<p>Emerson you will find a genuinely good man, and capable of spiritual discourse so as no other living is.</p>
<p>And so I will heartily bid you Good speed; and anticipate your home-coming victorious over that sad malady and over many other things;&#x2014;victorious <pb id="pg-33-264" n="33:264"/><hi rend="italic">enough</hi> I reckon this Lecturer will be; tho&#x2019; not in proportion to his intrinsic <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> among the English Lecturers we have sent, for that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> perhaps be too victorious!</p>

<p>The excellent Narration of events, Hayfield, Tait &#x26; others less joyful, was lying on the table for me yesterday morning. Along with it was the <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> beauty: a request for introductions to America whither Scott is going to lecture, it ultimately proved;&#x2014;I (with suppression of an inward growl) have now done the needful in that matter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580630-TC-AJS-01">TC to AJS, <date when="1858-06-30">30 June</date></ref>, and the two letters of recommendation enclosed: <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580630-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1858-06-30">30 June</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580630-TC-AMFR-01">TC to <sic>American friends</sic><corr>AMFR</corr>, <date when="1858-06-30">30 June</date></ref>.</note> and will send you the Letter <hi rend="italic">tomorrow:</hi> today Tait is loading enough. I cannot tell what to do with Tait as matters have gone: I can only <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> his Picture were in the Red Sea, and decide that if Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> keep it I, for one, will try to keep well out of sight or hearing of it for the future! So much I have I have<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> intimated to Tait; absolving <hi rend="italic">him</hi> from <hi rend="italic">blame</hi> on the subject; and I have said that I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> speak of it no more, and that you could (if he applied) for me as well as yourself. So make the best of it: if the sale were capable of being altogether abolished, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a real relief to me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday and since the night before Jean was here; very affectionate, nothing like so cheery &#x26; merry as she once was,&#x2014;Time demanding his dues there too. She had much endeavoured to bring me suitable specimens of cloth; but had not in any instance quite hit the mark: indeed I wish I had gone to Bull&#x2019;s myself;&#x2014;but she engages to new enterprises on the matter; will send to Glasgow even;&#x2014;and in short it is hoped the &#x201C;cares of cloth&#x201C; will be got transacted before long; and a beautiful stock of fitting raiment be once more among my conquests in this evil world. John, we heard yesterday, had <hi rend="italic">crossed</hi> Jean in the railway; &#x201C;summoned by telegraph into Galloway to see Arbuckle<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Arbuckle (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310817-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:341</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-17">17 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>).</note> who was very ill&#x201C;;&#x2014;today John writes that Arb<hi rend="italic">le</hi> had got the turn before his arrival; and that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will be at Dumfries tonight:&#x2014;tomorrow <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in passing, I consider likely.&#x2014; I go on well; am very sad and solitary; ill in want of a horse (tho&#x2019; my ancle is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> worsening); decidedly likely to improve in health in such <pb id="pg-33-265" n="33:265"/>an element as I have. The evening walks in the grey howl of the winds, by the loneliest places I can find, are like walks in Hades; yet there is something wholesome in them, something stern &#x26; grand: as if one <hi rend="italic">had</hi> the Eternities for company in defect of suitabler.</p>
<p>Poor John Welsh, I am truly wae to think of him, honourable useful young soul. I cannot pretend, either, to disagree quite with your sorrowful anticipations: but I consider you do exaggerate; and that John himself, being now heartily frightened, may do a great deal to help himself. If retreat to Madeira thro&#x2019; Winter or the like w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be of use (as surely it might), <hi rend="italic">you</hi> shall have the pleasure and solacement of <hi rend="italic">aiding</hi> in it (remember that) to whatever extent you like.</p>
<p>Tait was not jilted then in the Brighton matter! I expect some Narrative of it tomorrow:&#x2014;I hope it did not <hi rend="italic">hurt</hi> you; that your silence today is accountable otherwise than <hi rend="italic">so?</hi> My truant imagination has been trying it that way, tho&#x2019; with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> success!&#x2014;No rain but the slightest showers fell here, tho&#x2019; Cumberland &#x26;c got plenty of it; and the weather is still beautifully windy &#x26; cool. My wishes go even the length of Nero! <closer><salute>Adieu, dear Jeannie mine.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Last night I had the pleasure of receiving your letter, with Draught for &#xa3;14 interest on Bond; which comes punctually as the season of the Year itself,&#x2014;and with which I am just about walking out, to put it into the Banker&#x2019;s hand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Smith, Payne &#x26; Smiths, Lombard St., for whom the British Linen Bank, Dumfries, TC&#x2019;s usual bankers, were agents.</note> I am your debtor as always, and often think of the great pains you take, and have taken, about my small affairs,&#x2014;with a feeling which is not small.</p>
<p>Some three months hence I shall likely have a &#xa3;500<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Chapman &#x26; Hall for the first five vols. of the cheap edn. of TC&#x2019;s works; see Tarr 448.</note> which I may as well send to you, for investment, on your own judgement where safest and best. If about that time, you could bethink you of directing me how to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> in sending that sum&#x2014;But indeed that is a rather idle request upon a man so busy: I shall learn by the Banker here, readily enough, what the course is!</p>
<p>Ever since you last heard of me, I have been held like a Convict on the Treadwheel;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570903-TC-JWC-01"><sic>33:67</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1857-09-03">3 Sept.</date></corr></ref></note> and there is still another <hi rend="italic">year</hi> of it to come, before I can slip my chains, and have the best part of my job over. Such a job as I would not do again for the fee-simple of the Prussian Kingdom and of the next to it;&#x2014;far excelling, in misery and toil to me, all the jobs I ever had before! I ride much; and keep away from all mankind and their &#x201C;gaities&#x201C; to me there is nothing &#x201C;gay&#x201C; allotted;&#x2014;and I must husband myself and <hi rend="italic">get thro&#x2019; this thing</hi>, or it will be worse for me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC would not finish <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> until <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>; he wrote then in his Journal: &#x201C;On Sunday evening in the end of January (<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>) I walked out, with the multiplex feeling&#x2014;joy not very prominent in it, but a kind of solemn thankfulness traceable, that I had written the last sentence of that unutterable book, and, contrary to many forebodings in bad hours, had actually got done with it for ever&#x201C; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:284).</note></p>
<p>My poor wife had a bad winter in respect of health: confined to the House, strict prisoner, for 5 or 6 months, till the summer came fairly back to us; and then left as <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> as one might expect. Several weeks ago, I sent her off to Scotland to be out of this <hi rend="italic">roasting </hi>Babylon: she is there, among kind old friends and early scenes;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had gone to stay with the Donaldsons in Haddington, traveling overnight, <date when="1857-07-07">7</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-07-08">8 July<sic> 1857</sic></date>; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570708-JWC-TC-01"><sic>32:173</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-07-08">8 July</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> and I hope will come back to me before long, a little refitted.&#x2014;This is the hottest summer of all the 24 I have had in London: Corn-harvest said to be excellent;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570721-JWC-TC-01"><sic>32:193</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1857-07-21">21 [July]</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;a good thing, if only we can make a good use of it! But that latter clause I reckon more uncertain,&#x2014;I privately, now and then. &#x201C;Trade&#x201C; with its <hi rend="italic">etceteras </hi>is all in its explosive efflorescence (California gold, I imagine, much concerned in the phenomenon);<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570813-TC-AC-01"><sic>33:25</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1857-08-13">13 Aug.</date></corr></ref></note> and there never was as much &#x201C;wealth&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">in the pockets</hi> of England,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; perhaps in the <hi rend="italic">heart </hi>of it, the <hi rend="italic">head</hi> of it, and other noble departments, there has very often indeed been a greater overplus! Well; they will go the length of their <hi rend="italic">tether</hi> in spite of my croaking: so I hold my tongue.</p>
<p>India,&#x2014;in the private details as to those poor English <hi rend="italic">women</hi> especially,&#x2014;is a horror of horrors: it is no question they will extinguish those <hi rend="italic">hyaena</hi> mutineers of theirs;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Indian riots and killing of women and children, June and <date when="1857-07-00">July</date>, see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570725-TC-JWC-01"><sic>32:199</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-07-25">25 July</date>]</corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570810-JWC-TC-01"><sic>33:15</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1857-08-10">10 Aug.</date>].</corr></ref></note> but if they cannot learn to <hi rend="italic">command</hi> better (especially to command <hi rend="italic">Armies</hi> better), I had rather they came home from India.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570913-TC-JSTR-01"><sic>33:81</sic><corr>TC to JSTR, <date when="1857-09-13">13 Sept.</date></corr></ref></note>&#x2014;<closer><salute>Adieu my dear Sir.

Wall Street, New York.&#x201C;</note> <date when="1858-06-09">1858</date>&#x2014;</dateline><salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The day before yesterday your Letters came to hand, enclosing, all safe and right, the Draught for &#xa3;14,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Interest on Illinois bonds, paid every Feb. and Aug.</note> which could not gain admittance in February last!</p>
<p>I give you many thanks; and, truth to say, I am heartily ashamed for all the trouble you have had in this perverse instance. Two Letters now, with such precaution, and a third enclosed (which should have been the <hi rend="italic">first </hi>and the <hi rend="italic">only</hi>),&#x2014;all to get me persuaded to take a little money out of your hand!&#x2014;There is no doubt the mistake occurred at this door; the Letter first sent contains our Postman&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably John Bullock, who took over from John Piper, autumn <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570901-TC-JWC-01"><sic>33:64</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1857-09-01">1 Sept. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> visible signature with the word &#x201C;refused&#x201C;: there is where one hitch was, everybody else has done his part to perfection and with success. One might almost cry and laugh both at once over such a thing. The truth is, this long while back,&#x2014;young fools being in the habit of bothering me about &#x201C;autographs&#x201C; and other nonsenses, provoking when you have to throw a shilling into the fire along with them,&#x2014;there has been a standing order that no foreign Letter is to be accepted, if <hi rend="italic">unpaid</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The recipient was charged double for letters posted without due postage.</note> unless the handwriting be known. That is the whole mystery. I no doubt saw that Letter, it would be transiently shewn to me; but I had not the least recognised it; and so (probably in very great haste, and sunk among my own paper-clippings) had negatorily shaken my head; and sent the beneficence home again, in a most astonishing manner, as if it had been a <hi rend="italic">male</hi>ficence! Nothing more tragicomical has happened lately. Forgive me, dear Sir, and laugh with me in spite of the trouble you have had: and pray put y<hi rend="italic">r </hi>Name on the outside, if in future you dread any such occurrence.</p>
<p>I think I had, once or perhaps twice for a moment, in my head, that some Letter used to come from you about that season of the year, and that none had come: but I mainly concluded, as the whole Finance of America had suddenly gone topsyturvey, that my small deposit in it had sunk among the ruin,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> discovery even of Mr Butler for the moment; and that by and by I sh<hi rend="italic">d </hi>hear good account of it nevertheless from the said Mr B:&#x2014;so that in fact I did not think about it at all, or any more than if the Bank of England had stopt payment with it.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the financial crisis in the U.S. and Britain, see <ref target="volume-33/ed-33-introduction"><sic>33:xviii</sic><corr>33:introduction</corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571115-TC-LOA-01"><sic>118</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1857-11-15">15 Nov. 1857</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571123-JWC-AHO-01"><sic>126</sic><corr>JWC to AHO, [<date when="1857-11-23">23 Nov. 1857</date>]</corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>And now you inform me there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no halt or stoppage; and in spite of the great earthquake, that small packet lies quiet in its place! I can only say that it is very strange;&#x2014;and that you must be one of the best Financiers ever heard of. For which I am full of thanks and of wonder.&#x2014;We had, as you say, abundant tumult here of the same kind; and specimens, I do believe, fully as ugly as any in America: indeed I hear from observers, and it confirms any inspection I have had myself, that for reckless gambling under the name of Commerce, Glasgow challenges New York or any terrestrial City; and that there seldom was such a &#x201C;Bank&#x201C;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Western Bank of Scotland; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571115-TC-LOA-01"><sic>33:118</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1857-11-15">15 Nov. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> as that of theirs that collapsed on the late occasion. The more is the pity for Glasgow and the like Cities; and the bigger heaps of gold they gather, the uglier do they grow,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Midas,&#x201C; chap. 1 of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>.</note>&#x2014;even while their gold stays with them, which it will not long.</p>
<p>Yesterday, no farther gone, I got <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with that First Part of my Book:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had sent away &#x201C;the last Proof Slips&#x201C; of the first two vols. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, &#x201C;my work in them all done&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580609-TC-EC-01"><sic>33:236</sic><corr>TC to EC, <date when="1858-06-09">9 June</date></corr></ref>.</note> you can judge whether it was with a feeling of relief or not.
