## Build

*While most of these dependencies are installed automatically by executing the scripts in *bin/*, see below for a list of the major dependencies required to build and deploy CLO3. This list is not exhaustive, and one should consult those scripts, as well as the respective *package.json* files for a complete list.

**Dependencies:**

- Git
- python3-pip
- Nodeenv
- Node (^12.18.3)
- MongoDB
- ElasticSearch (^7.8)

**Install Git**

Install Git using your system's package manager. See [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](their installation directions). On Debian/Ubuntu based systems, the command is:

### The Scripts

## Notes:

1. *[**ATTENTION**] It is absolutely important at all times to understand your dependency structure. **It is important to document if a command is run with `sudo`.** It is important to understand whether Node is using a globally installed package, a package it knows to install w/ `npm install`, or if the dependency is not being tracked by node at all.*
