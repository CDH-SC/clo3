                                world – an order, a new order. There is ideality, which is
                                creativeness in him – in Alexander. But the ambition of the East is
                                a hunger. It is like the yearning of the north for the south – it
                                wants the limitless stupidly. Only [????] the Mediterranean is
                                ambition.</p>

                                moral code. In Greece men were reared to be citizens – the family
                                was but the means. Life meant the spiritual conflict of the males.
                                Wherever Jewish influence has been preponderant – civilized life
                                declines – as when the Puritans ruined the civilization of England
                                till a Latin influence ( [????] of France) partially restored it.
                                Morality is a matter of pure convenience – what is best to do to get

                                were opposed to Jewish morality. The influence of Christianity has

                                Fay says they and Oscar never talked anything but inspired “rot”. As

                                themselves. Fay said scarcely anything – nothing serious – Oscar

                                fantastic projects. Before dinner, I had shown Fay our two letters

                            <p>There comes a crack into a man’s nature in these matters. Love is not

                                Late a count–arrived, a well-bred personage, full of earful tact.

                                – this is well. [Birny?] is to the true poet what an adopted design

                            <p>When the Count comes there is talk of Fay’s birthplace – Geneva. The

                                been born. Fay had a narrow escape of being born at the right place
                                – Naples. Michael would like to have been born in London. Fay says
                                “that is where a poet should be born”.</p>

                                affections, the infinite of Woman, Child &amp; God. He was infinite
                                in praise and in the art of praise-building. His memory built in

                            <p>The artists dine. Shannon comes first – vengeful from a committee. He

                            <p>Egypt lends herself to farce. She is a fruit of a putrescent
                                civilization like the Chinese Empress. He is greatly interested in
                                hearing about Dryden’s <hi rend="underline">All For Love</hi>, in
                                wh: Cleopatra becomes a Nell Gwynn. He specially enjoys Dryden’s
                                fine bit of psychology where Anthony, forced again to meet the
                                deserted Cleopatra, Ant. exclaims “God, I thank you: I formed the
                                danger greater than it was, and now ‘tis near ‘tis lessened”</p>
                            <p>Michael &amp; Fay get up to betting a box of chocolates to a green
                                tie that Duse will not play little Arthur’s <hi rend="underline"
                                    >Tristram</hi>.</p>
                            <p>When the mushrooms come there is exhortation: “Hush! No-one is to
                                speak to me for several moments” - &amp; he begins to listen. No
                                flavor is so full of itself as a mushroom’s.</p>
                            <p>Fay has been talking to an architect named Wilson who has pleased him
                                by realizing that the Greeks &amp; the Japs are the only two peoples
                                who have lived for beauty &amp; the Japs have per-sisted for
                                centuries while the Greeks were blighted only too</p>

                            <p>In the Drawing Room there is again betting that Dr. Garnett will
                                dedicate <hi rend="underline">Shakespeare, Pedagogue &amp;
                                    Poacher</hi> to us.</p>
                            <p>Then Fay reads Verlaine’s marvelous Langueur (“Jadis et Naguère”)</p>
                            <p>I shall always hear his voice, low as an underground rillet – now
                                &amp; then with petuland emphasis – as it gave:</p>
                            <p>“O n'y vouloir, o n'y pouvoir mourir un peu!</p>
                            <p>Ah, tout est bu, tout est mangé - plus rien à dire.”</p>
                            <p>And again:</p>
                            <p>“L'âme seulette a mal au coeur d'un ennui dense”</p>
                            <p>And the massive first line becomes of fate, yet altogether personal,
                                in his convinced voice - </p>
                            <p>“Je suis l'Empire à la fin de la décadence.”</p>
                            <p>Fay says this poem is that rarest thing, that had only been known in
                                English &amp; Italian, a <hi rend="underline">Dramatic</hi> Sonnet,
                                as Browning wrote <hi rend="underline">Dramatic</hi> Lyrics. Michael
                                grieves Browning never found the Dramatic Sonnet. Rosetti has
                                several examples. Fay hates specially the

                                repetitions – a special charm in Verlaine - &amp; the even more

                            <p>It is Wednesday, &amp;, as one abandoned of hope I am curled up on

                            <p>The talk is chiefly of <hi rend="underline">Don Giovanni</hi> – but

                                I tell him I shall say to Bernhard “there is not a sign of him”
                                left, “[ever?] a sign ”he murmurs,” when Bern-hard is by. I am in

                            <p>I amuse him from a heart, dropping like a stalactite-cave.</p>
                            <p>O child of Helène, Cornelia, Pia, Decclata – what place is there for
                                you in this world?</p>
                            <p>I tell him [????] is come to say good-bye before starting for Italy.
                                No, he is only come to say it is the only day this week he can come.

                                all the mad rigamorole of the libretto – chuckling over its formal
                                bits of eighteenth century “business” &amp; humour – sliding lissome

                                such perfect womanhood ordering &amp; pleading from the tiny bed.
                                Fay was enchanted.</p>
                            <p>Then wicked Michael told of Dara L.’s remark, after she had praised
                                Shannon’s beauty his sweet mouth (“He hasn’t got one at all”
                                interpolates Fay) &amp; turned to Fay’s own portrait “He is exactly
                                like a Mr. Wright, who taught me drawing 30 years ago, &amp; very
                                like a clergyman I used to know.”</p>
                            <p>At the end Michael, pointing to her velvet stomacher, asks “Do you
                                know what this demands?”</p>
                            <p>“No – ”</p>
                            <p>“A Cochon d’Or” ___ &amp; he flies.</p>
                            <p>“Mind you remember

                                of the drawing master of 30 years ago.” So Michael harasses the
                                flight. “Let me see – Wright that’s the name!” “Yes – 30 years
                                ago!”--- &amp; he is gone.</p>

                            <p>says he does not come to eat, but to talk - “I would go anywhere to
                                talk” &amp; I feel how futile to say so. There can be no talk after;
                                &amp; there is not. “I am giving you an American evening” he sighs
                                out, as if dissatisfied. Just for a short space, when left alone, I
                                tell him of my pleasure in his chapter &amp; notes, on Leonardo,
                                &amp; my appreciation of the more restive &amp; athletic style of
                                the Micheal Angelo. And I tell him of touches I have given to his
                                most enticing &amp; personal sentences. We are warmer a moment - a
                                gulf-stream just fringes our apartness - no more. Even then he says
                                with dusky petulance “You know, Field, I am a great person in
                                America.”</p>
                            <p>I cry when he is gone. If it is tragic for a God to take on human
                                limits - it is abjectly painful for a man to keep his poor limits
                                &amp; not take on some deity. He goes through the door a small, trim
                                man; &amp; therefore full of disappointment to himself &amp; to
                                others. He is dust - he is trivial. I have seen him once too
                                often.</p>

                            <p>A dazzling day - almost it glitters as on the classic- good Friday
                                morning when [????] from my hoop - &amp; felt in the air endless
                                [bun?], the sky &amp; ecstasy. It is a pure spring day, &amp; even

                            <p>We have spent the day very simply. We read of Christ parting with his

                                asked for my two Good Friday sonnets. We have been busy with a scene

                                with one finger &amp; gathers up his jaw in a hand that supports the

                            <p>Infinite jest of the chocolate fish! We have brought tears of mirth

                                Among the difficult Arts of Beautiful Living the Art of gathering
                                &amp; presenting primroses is scarcely ever learnt. Janet is perfect
                                in it. One usually receives primroses with a sense of nervous
                                prostration, such as a picture-gallery produces; &amp; with an
                                inarticulate hatred for the giver. But I lift out of an orderly box
                                little separate nosegays, their tender stems, that always make me
                                think of the feet of arab girls that have the heels &amp; nails
                                flushed with henna, are ready to be dipped in water. I bring out the
                                great ivory lead bowl, I set the primroses' feet to shine under its
                                deep bath; &amp; there are the primroses in their orient yellow,
                                giving out their languid perfume. – sweet girls, but not to me of
                                the west.</p>

                            <p> I read to him 2 sonnets- averring that one of them is addressed to
                                Tommy. He vows he will punish that sonnet. Afterwards he remarks in
                                reference to a fine simile- Tommy is like a camel.</p>

                                battle? Should I never let the will act unconscious? I could make my
                                unfeeling feet dance - but the dance was to me that of winter

                                presence of its great challenger! It is as it were, of different
                                nationality, but of the same humanity.</p>
                            <p>On Sunday, at breakfast, I said to Michael “Our passion has a
                                tendency to walk the ground with burning feet; it rarely takes wings
                                &amp; flies.” This was well said of our later work - but with Herod
                                there is more flight in this nervous Arab’s passion.</p>
                            <p>So Dr. Dot came on Friday - she too thinks my ill is transitory -
                                &amp; indeed it is much less of a weight in my being - use &amp;
                                improvement both assist me. And the dismal doctor has at last
                                vouchsafed to say that the cases of anaesthesia he has personally
                                known were due to Influenza. So all our panic might have been
                                reduced to this suggestion, wh: the “hollows” in my head seem to
                                justify.</p>
                            <p>Today - Sunday - is May Day &amp; we are expecting Tommy &amp; his

                            <p>She dies; it is our prayer that she should die: </p>
                            <p>With what sweet music shall she fall on death,</p>
                            <p>For jarred is all the music of Love’s breath </p>
                            <p>And she much hear all noises that pass by</p>
                            <p>Without His muffling wings? She will hear the cry </p>
                            <p>Of laughter from the streets: what the street saith</p>
                            <p>Rises through open doors: she shuddereth As one had stripped her to
                                the open sky –</p>
                            <p>But who is this, with face that none may mark</p>
                            <p>Bows over her, &amp; silent spreads the shades? –</p>
                            <p>Within her hand there is a flower that fades,</p>
                            <p>And a great grove behind the scepter shows</p>
                            <p>O Venerable, draw her to repose,</p>
                            <p>Keep her for ever with thee in the dark!</p>
                            <p>Marie is like a sod of green turf. When Tommy peeks, he will find the
                                daisy, the grass, the wholesome warm.</p>
                            <p>The May Day is – as not before for years. From the terrace range on

                            <p>Marie is dusk, responsive to the country air as blue-berry. She has
                                ableness of character - the true Protestant strain, &amp; ability -
                                her English is wonderful in attack - &amp; a bright-eyed
                                independence of phrasing makes one laugh as at the motions of a
                                healthy living creature in the meadows.</p>
                            <p>Now &amp; then she has the gesture - a trick of the brows that
                                reminds me of Michael’s old friend of Paris days – Miss Gérante –
                                who, strange to say, Marie describes as almost a “great-grandmother”
                                to her! So it comes about we learn from Tommy’s bride how the good
                                little soul, the sister of Michael’s supreme love - Alfred Gérante,
                                came quietly to her end in the Deaconness Home, with <hi

                                agitated, &amp; close upon Painter’s heels presses John. I decide
                                they shall not meet. I am frayed with weeping; feeling already only

                            <p>He is disappointed in Sabbatai – because he conceives Renan’s Jesus,
                                repeated dramatically in the central actions of his life. He would
                                even have the cock crow thrice. He holds with Renan, there was
                                absolute disillusion when Jerusalem was entered; he regards that
                                Life as to itself failure.</p>

                            <p>Painter has always felt profoundly the tragedy of Christ - he would
                                have liked our Sabbatai to have something of his richness of allure,
                                his tenderness. This was not in our scope.</p>
                            <p>We speak of Rossetti. “You are like him-” “No, Michael, Rossetti was
                                one of the original minds of his time. I am not that. I am a
                                spectator, doubted by the actor. That means I am a critic. I am the
                                greatest spectator I have ever known.” Of his painting he will not
                                speak, but much of

                            <p>Our news is most exciting. My copy of <hi rend="underline">The
                                    Prado</hi> is with us. It is a glorious book – rich,
                                invigorating, modest, arrogant &amp; enjoying – full of exquisite,
                                suggestive phrases &amp; sentences. In a word I have the joy of
                                recognizing the Painter as a Writer. How many Kingdoms he conquers!
                                For the rest – doubtless the Eagles will gather together over the
                                body of this book.</p>

                                have been to the gallery? In any case we possess the book &amp; this

                                famous Rottingdean beauty – a face as clear &amp; placid as the
                                seas. She is growing better, &amp; is not only herself, but more

                            <p>spoil, need becomes actuality. In the death scene this moment – the
                                capture of wh: is the method of the play - remains neglected. In
                                fact it is avoided &amp; a sense of levity triumphs.</p>
                            <p>The radiant morning glooms… Before tea, while at wonder in front of
                                the house, we see a thunder cloud over the north, from which the air
                                takes hollowness. A malignant pallor begins to turn Eastward… At our
                                return the doors, the windows are all open as they are before a
                                coming of death.</p>
                            <p>Afterward on the Downs we see the storm stream smoulderingly out to
                                sea, while we are in a light of keen relief, almost a shimmer.
                                Before the lines of down I pace, leaving Michael &amp; Chow on a
                                summit-mound &amp; concentrate my passion on Tristan’s End.
                                Gradually the vision of a new last scene forms, different from the
                                fine situation in the <hi rend="underline">Flame Tristan</hi>, where
                                he grips the wall, supported by his old father-in-law &amp; his old

                                – Julia Donna have all profited from the sound drawing of the place.

                                she is cold, &amp; yet not virginal. Art to which all things lie

                            <p>That judgement of tragedy is true in one aspect – that the appeal to
                                the eye watching for movement on the stage must be melodramatic to
                                arrest it boldly. And both Fay &amp; little Arthur would be swayed
                                by the peculiar mode of today – viz, the artistic. The world tries
                                to see like the painter now-a-days, not to feel &amp; express like
                                the poet. Great Tragedy will have its bold moments of melodrama –
                                may even have a melodramatic construction (Hamlet) but however good
                                the melodrama may be, the tragedy is not good unless the creative
                                mood behind it is essential &amp; dominating &amp; ominous.</p>

                            <p>Tristan is seated against pillows in a chair by the empty hearth.
                                Behind his form, like a strange glory, his great golden harp stands
                                – across his knees the gold cover of the harp. He is asleep and

                                madness before the omens of the open windows, the growling cloud.

                            <p>Tristan wakes – alone in the storm – the wind blows now, the doors
                                close with a thud, the windows beat. He is alone in Hell - alone
                                with his doom, that everything he does is sin, that he is in the
                                velocity of a great anguish forever – in the confusion he feels

                            <p>Dear Painter,</p>
                            <p>I have nothing to record, but a long, wakeful night. I was left clear
                                brained by the tossing wind. Through the long hours the nightingale
                                &amp; the cock sang to me. The occasional re-minder of Time,
                                cheerfulness &amp; not betraying rose up so wholesomely against the
                                long liquid vibration of that other throat. The nightingale’s song
                                comes up from a chalice of rich liquor; it proceeds from wine. There
                                is no lament in it &amp; the Greek story is all wrong.</p>
                            <p>I have privately preserved at the old florist’s a bed of ranunculus
                                for you - the pale lemon flowers we love won’t come out; some <hi

                                flame.</p>
                            <p>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _.</p>
                            <p>Painter, I like to hear of your plays. Soon you will

                            <p>My new version of the Death-scene of Tristan is read to Michael. She

                                when Tristan’s hand falls through the hollow of his harp…after
                                that…well, anticlimax reigns. In a few moments she ends the scene -
                                self-same with its beginning. The whole is an entirely new end to
                                poor Tristan’s agony. Laus Dei!</p>

                                day is not of Art. We grow nasty with weather.</p>

                                - a world in herself. I see her as I shall part from her - in the

                            <p>Dear Peacock Room! Typical of our Inspirer, the Peacock, the bird of
                                the great green of Heaven. He set our scheme of colour, he watched
                                us from his bronzes as we accomplished our Dream in our little Rooms
                                - his blue was our firmament, his green our Earth, &amp; we knew of
                                no nil nimbus so victorious as his - the glory of the saints &amp;
                                the Rose of Paradise were melted into one gilded flush of rays for
                                this Paraclite of aestheticism.</p>
                            <p>And here Whistler has set him up for the ages - superhuman as a
                                Buddha on the shutters we have him swelled into godhead - his tail
                                became a second heaven, his eyes at last <hi rend="underline"

                                is her adoration, &amp; her dream. Father had this talisman - he
                                loved. Sorrow &amp; bitterness &amp; jealousy made desolation round
                                his love - but the women he loved never forgot his love. It is a

                                grown confused in our minds &amp; had asked in two letters if <hi
                                    rend="underline">Leigh</hi> were near – they replied they did
                                not know its situation - so we concluded all was well. But at the
                                mention of <hi rend="underline">Bank</hi>, we realised our error. By
                                cross-questioning we discovered that the rooty path was the woodland
                                way to Bank. It is indeed strange. I thought I was going crazy on
                                that rooty path.</p>
                            <p>Of course we never go that side of the woods, &amp; we refer to the
                                place as “<hi rend="underline">where</hi> the wild thyme blows”. I
                                had remarked to Michael “I like all the woods on the other side, but
                                I can’t abide these woods.”</p>
                            <p>I am not a bit nervous or unhappy in any other part of the forest. On

                                of death out of the very superabundance of life. So with the

                            <p>portant we were to him - how we cared for us, but apart from that we
                                “helped his functioning” - far more important than anything else!!
                                His Spanish Countess now is where we were then - but he is far away
                                as we are &amp; therefore we are for more vivifying. He is not yet

                                sustenance, having left off wine &amp; coffee &amp; most meats.</p>
                            <p>Early in the evening he referred to having just seen “the one &amp;
                                only artist” - I stretched mind over the world; wondered if it were
                                Rodin, &amp; then Michael solved the phrase - “Oh, you mean
                                Ricketts” &amp; we laughed at the rival’s irony. But just at first
                                the eyes (that used to be ‘blue [????] weather’) looked very gray,
                                with a thunder-knot in them, till our greeting &amp; mood told him

                            <p>We are cheered by a delightfully confidential letter from Fay -
                                Mary’s single visit - the Pelleas &amp; Melissande of Sarah &amp;
                                Mrs. Pat - these are lightly evoked. Also by post comes a little
                                snap-shot of Bernhard - like a bee just outside the frame of his
                                Domenico Veneziano (or Baldovinetti) Medama. He looks so small,
                                &amp; tiny bee-thunders are about his brow &amp; lips - the rich
                                storminess of a summer buzzer.</p>
                            <p>We are getting happy in our Forest. And the Down &amp; brakes behind
                                Woodside where we go next Friday are filled with greater influence -
                                some god has local habituation there, altho we do not know him
                                yet.</p>

                            <p>I must return to Paragon - rather to that visit to the Palace I left
                                unchronicled. It was delicious. After dinner we were introduced to 3
                                new Italian Pictures - one, Early Tuscan, really noble &amp;
                                hieractic in effect - a calm Dream to live with.</p>

                                by Shannon “What a beautiful dress you are wearing!” The pendants
                                &amp; jewels return on their makers eyes with fascination. Shannon
                                takes us to the Shephard’s Bush station as guide to the reeling

                                    rend="superscript">th</hi> - The Artists dined with us. Mary had
                                got up a Bach afternoon, &amp; Fay &amp; Michael met there &amp;
                                from thence journeyed to Paragon together. Unfortunately the
                                difficult great music had wrought Fay to nervous fatigue &amp;
                                headache. He looked white, as if dying in mind, at his arrival,
                                though he was so excited he poured out a stream of talk on Bach. A
                                prelude he heard was like the outpouring of a bag of jewels - dusk,
                                with here &amp; there one flash to measure the wealth of the cold
                                gem-cascade. Bach composes on the brain itself, his music is organic
                                only on that instrument - as some music is only organic on the
                                heart, or the nerve-centres. He is the most taxing of all musicians
                                - his high demand is almost of super-human quality. When we dine the
                                heat &amp; the festive dishes, meeting Bach in the [????] Painter’s
                                body, produce a deadness of nausea - we quite fear the worst. But he
                                revives.</p>

                                [????] merry &amp; charming almost as in his youth. The talk after
                                dinner is obliterated from my mind by anxiety &amp; by the deadly

                                friends…we were more than half dead in the July hotness.</p>

                                5 minutes transit, we let the live sponges leap about in the
                                baruche. I have never felt so like sobbing over my boxes - full of
                                the “broken meat” of our bottles &amp; clothes. It is a day of awful
                                jostle &amp; damp, &amp; towards evening, I fall ill.</p>
                            <p>Through an atmosphere still bleeding vapours I drag myself to the
                                past; - then, perforce I must turn to the sun, &amp; its cheery sign
                                – the glade, the firm, fragrant high-road, the sandy bank, the

                                [surine?] from Bank [gr?] across the stream. All this fair lot was
                                ours yesterday – I still see the glint of the Professor’s
                                dress-shirt, as we paced the glade, - the gavel-bank, the birds, the
                                little noises among the leaves, - all were ours. Henry likes the
                                modern rooms with the round cherry-tree in front – I cannot - for me

                            <p>In response to a letter from Michael, in which she said the real
                                meaning of Christ’s saying “Depart from me, ye that work iniquity!”
                                was “Depart all ye that are out of touch with me” - Painter comes
                                into magnetic touch with the Poet.</p>
                            <p>“I have news. I have turned sculptor. I have modelled a man &amp; a

                            <p>I write to Painter</p>
                            <p>This is of the god! It is subtle, irresistible; it does not answer to
                                the words that you are a sculptor – it is indeed news – <hi
                                    rend="underline">tidings</hi> rather, &amp; of the kind that

                            <p>Henry &amp; I go over the “to-morrow” list. Henry broods over the
                                drinking Sphinx, but all my love - &amp; all the foxity of my life
                                to for “a weeping Terminal” In that – but I speak not: speech is not
                                for that wh. can be wrought.</p>
                            <p>Could you, Painter, I wonder, be some year happy in the forest for a
                                day or two? Could you be patient to learn to tongue of the moss,
                                &amp; all the accents of the trees? Henry knows not. I wonder.</p>
                            <p>I would far rather you were at the Palace with your clay. Painter,
                                you have been called by one who is not your enemy, “an abstract
                                eel”, &amp; this too is for me your charm. Abstractness <hi
                                    rend="underline">with attention</hi> is far better than “joy
                                with economy.”</p>
                            <p>I cannot turn to the forest now that you have set me on the track of
                                art, - &amp; yet there is a cherry-tree the poets wake to at dawn –
                                kaleidoscopic in its light through purified leaves, - where the

                                their old age of song; and there is the strange reddening &amp;
                                re-budding of the summer oaks, &amp; shaking, &amp; dropping, &amp;

                                Just Diane sitting by the [????] of the River of Time – watching the

                            <p>All the heavens are wide this third Forest Sunday - the cherry-tree
                                is tongued &amp; eloquent &amp; little clouds are harboured in a bay
                                of air, like a happy gala-fleet. The moss of the forest glows
                                surprisingly; it has fattened with the rain - its [whorls?] &amp;
                                fronds are tender, almost sleek. The dead beech-leaves as we pass
                                over them give us the experience of spiced &amp; mummied rain - over
                                them, &amp; the sky &amp; the lawns the sun is sprinkled in droplets

                                at camp about the forest. Strange the sound of the drum accompanied
                                by the call of peace from the Dove at the core of our Labyrinth. We
