<div1 type="section" id="ed-45-introduction">

<p>The letters in this volume cover the eighteen-month span from <date when="1867-07-00">July 1867</date> through <date when="1868-12-00">December 1868</date>; the volume includes 170 of Thomas Carlyle&#x02019;s letters and an appendix of notes to Henry Larkin. TC continued to mourn the loss of Jane Welsh Carlyle, which cast a shadow of gloom over his life that he was rarely able to elude for long. John Rutter Chorley&#x02019;s death on <date when="1867-06-29">29 June 1867</date> contributed to TC&#x02019;s growing sense of despondency. In his mind the loss of JWC in <date when="1866-04-00">April 1866</date> was the signal of his own imminent demise. Joseph Neuberg&#x02019;s death in <date when="1867-03-00">March 1867</date>, and now Chorley&#x02019;s, convinced him that, as he phrased it in his journal, his &#x0201C;own time must be soon&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-06-29">29 June 1867</date>). To his brother John he explained, &#x0201C;At my <hi rend="italic">real</hi> grief for poor Chorley I have not yet <hi rend="italic">arrived</hi>, but am daily arriving. Very pathetic when I consider him; very sad and strange this rapid &#x26; continual disappearance of friend after friend, since April gone a year! &#x02026; I do not believe I have now anybody in London that cares as much ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me; tho&#x02019; several care much more ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me than I feel to deserve of them&#x0201D; (TC to JAC, <date when="1867-07-05">5 July 1867</date>). In all three instances, TC&#x02019;s mourning followed a similar pattern. The ordeal of &#x0201C;arriving&#x0201D; was peculiarly painful because it obliged him to confront his own blindness before he could honor the departed &#x0201C;friend.&#x0201D; The common source of anguish was his realization that his success as a &#x0201C;man of letters&#x0201D; had not only compromised his principles but had also obscured his judgment of the true worth of those who had loved him. Like Neuberg, Chorley had set an example of intellectual integrity that filled TC with a mixture of veneration and regret. In his journal he commented, &#x0201C;I did not know a more punctually correct man; nor, with his rigourous almost shrewish temper, a more carefully honest. &#x02026; Has left no &#x02018;fame&#x02019; or general recognit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, in any kind, behind him,&#x02014;which so many thousands of far less worth are sounding on the &#x02018;popular gale&#x02019;&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-07-03">3 July 1867</date>).</p>
<p>On <date when="1867-07-09">9 July 1867</date> TC&#x02019;s discomfort was increased by a letter he received from Chorley&#x02019;s younger brother, Henry, informing him that John had left him &#x0201C;&#x000A3;500, in token of his great regard.&#x0201D; TC was overcome by feelings of shame. In his journal he noted, &#x0201C;Poor good Chorley leaves me (it seems) a Legacy of &#x000A3;500! Nothing in that kind c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> more surprise me; I did not know the poor hard wiry Chorley so loved me in his heart as he must have done! I did justice to the rigorous correctness, to the many excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> qualities he had; but there was something so secluded, rigid, narrow-hearted, sharp, and indignantly shut up ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the world and its troublesome inhabitants, in his way of life; something <pb id="pg-45-xiv" n="45:xiv"/>so unprofessing too, I never guessed for myself such a sympathy from him. It is almost a rebuke to me&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-07-14">14 July 1867</date>). Replying to Henry Chorley, TC requested that the funds be diverted elsewhere, either to a Library charity or to William Brownsword Chorley, an elder brother who had suffered &#x0201C;commercial misfortunes.&#x0201D; But Henry Chorley gently denied these pleas, explaining in his letter of <date when="1867-07-11">11 July 1867</date> that William&#x02019;s &#x0201C;blind &#x26; grasping selfishness harassed John into premature old age,&#x0201D; and that nothing &#x0201C;would more have pained &#x26; disturbed your friend, than the bare idea of such a malversation of his wishes as regards yourself.&#x0201D; TC was forced to accept the gift, which only prolonged the anxiety he suffered from his own self-imposed &#x0201C;rebuke.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>Chorley&#x02019;s disdain for &#x0201C;fame&#x0201D; and empty &#x0201C;prizes&#x0201D; was on TC&#x02019;s mind shortly after when he received encouraging news from John Forster, an old friend who &#x0201C;cared&#x0201D; deeply about him and served his interests tirelessly. Forster had persuaded the publisher Frederic Chapman to complete the uniform (cheap) edition (<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x02013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>) with a seven-volume issue of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> as well as publishing a deluxe &#x0201C;Library Edition&#x0201D; of TC&#x02019;s collected works. TC confided to John A. Carlyle on <date when="1867-07-16">16 July 1867</date>, &#x0201C;I confess I feel no trace of enthus<hi rend="italic">m</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> [the edition]; nothing but langour contempt and indifference for said &#x02018;Works&#x02019; or at least for their &#x02018;readers&#x02019; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> them! The Works indeed have cost me my life, and <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> in some measure from the heart, and all I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do; but the &#x02018;readers&#x02019; of them were, and are&#x02014;what shall I say? No man&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in this world can demand for itself the smallest doit of wages, or is intrinsically any better than <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>. That is the fact, when one arrives where I am.&#x0201D; Yet TC persevered with the proofs of the new edition of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, commenting in his journal on <date when="1867-08-25">25 August 1867</date> that &#x0201C;<supplied>[I]</supplied> have got them [the seven volumes] nearly ready, first two quite so; busy all last week &#x02026; with that, not unwelcome, but yet sad &#x26; sombre operat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.&#x0201D; His beleaguered printer, Charles Robson, a fellow Scotsman from Kelso, was forced to endure frequent admonitions to work faster and more efficiently. On <date when="1867-11-21">21 November 1867</date>, TC erupted in a letter to Robson: &#x0201C;I am sorry and surprised to find in this batch of sheets a sad falling off! Three or perhaps 4 entirely <hi rend="italic">gross</hi> errors; indicating want of intelligence as well as of <hi rend="italic">attention</hi>. &#x02026; This will never do.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>During this period TC exaggerated the extent of his retreat from society. On <date when="1867-08-10">10 August 1867</date> he confided to John, &#x0201C;I am very idle; indeed unfit for exert<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, so perpetually worried with dyspepsia&#x02014;so very <hi rend="italic">sad</hi>, too, in general, and with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> heart or interest in anything or any person now near me.&#x0201D; Declining an invitation from Lady Ashburton to make use of her country estates in Hampshire and Surrey while she stayed in Italy, TC wrote: &#x0201C;Thanks for Melchet, Addiscombe &#x26;c;&#x02014;you are lavishly generous as ever: but <supplied>[they]</supplied> are of no charm to me, and no utility, unless the Lady of them were there! London, totally empty for ten days past, is now all my own; pavements clean and vacant, air fresh and soft: where c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I be better, than left to myself, and my own <pb id="pg-45-xv" n="45:xv"/>poor tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> here such as they are?&#x0201D; (TC to Lady A, <date when="1867-08-05">5 Aug. 1867</date>). Toward the end of the month he reported to her, &#x0201C;My health is much what you used to see it,&#x02014;rather inclined to be <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> ever since &#x02018;summer set in,&#x02019; with its fluctuat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, with its <hi rend="italic">unripe vegetables</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c Society did not come very much ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me, yet fully more than I desired; it I did not go into at all;&#x02014;was not once <hi rend="italic">out</hi> anywhere for above 18 months now. In fact, it has fallen evening and I know it well, &#x26; am nothing loth that it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi>: if my work be all done, why sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I wish to linger here one hour beyond the set time?&#x0201D; (TC to Lady A, <date when="1867-08-27">27 Aug. 1867</date>).</p>
<p>Yet the record of TC&#x02019;s literary exertions indicates that he was not quite ready to retire submissively into the &#x0201C;evening.&#x0201D; On <date when="1867-08-01">1 August 1867</date> &#x0201C;Shooting Niagara: and After?&#x0201D; was published in <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x02019;s Magazine</hi>. Two days later he commented in his journal that &#x0201C;<supplied>[a]</supplied>n article for Masson and &#x02018;Macmillan&#x02019;s Magazine&#x02019; took up a good deal of time. It came out mostly from accident, little by volition, and is very fierce, exaggerative, ragged, unkempt, and defective. Nevertheless I am secretly rather glad than otherwise that it is out, that the howling doggeries (dead ditto and other) should have my last word on their affairs and them, since it was to be had&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal, <date when="1867-08-03">3 Aug. 1867</date>; Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:353). But TC&#x02019;s satisfaction did not last long. In the same week of August that he claimed that he was &#x0201C;very idle,&#x0201D; he was restlessly trying to correct the &#x0201C;defective&#x0201D; aspects of the essay, having taken up Frederic Chapman&#x02019;s recommendation that it be republished as a pamphlet. In an entry in his journal, dated <date when="1867-09-13">13 September 1867</date>, he lamented, &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">C</hi>d have done it rightly in at most two days, had my nerves been in average order; but there was no <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> &#x26;c for me, nothing but depression, sorrowful bewilder<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and stupefact<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; on wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> sad terms the thing took me <hi rend="italic">10 or 14 days</hi>;&#x02014;and no sooner was it gone to the Printer than I decide <hi rend="italic">to suppress</hi> the greater part of those &#x02018;addit<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>&#x02019;; and discern that with that last section suppressed, it will do tolerably!&#x0201D;</p>
<p>The manuscripts of these &#x0201C;additions&#x0201D; held in the National Library of Scotland<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">1. MS: NLS 1798.13&#x02013;18 and NLS 1798.19&#x02013;21; see D. J. Trela, &#x0201C;Carlyle&#x02019;s Shooting Niagara: The Writing and Revising of an Article and Pamphlet,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Victorian Periodicals Review</hi> 25.1 (Spring, <date when="1992-00-00">1992</date>): 30&#x02013;34.</note> suggest that TC was struggling with the idea of expanding his brief commentary on parliaments in section X of &#x0201C;Shooting Niagara.&#x0201D; The context for these remarks was undoubtedly the debates surrounding the Second Reform Act, which passed the House of Commons on <date when="1867-07-15">15 July</date> and was given Royal assent a month later. The baffling procedure by which this radical bill inched its way toward legislation through a thicket of amendments startled MPs themselves. TC may have felt that these passages might distract readers from his closing warning about the dangers posed to the country by the capitulation of the &#x0201C;game-preserving&#x0201D; Aristocracy to mob rule: &#x0201C;He cannot bridle the wild horse of a Plebs any longer:&#x02014;for a generation past, he has not even tried to <pb id="pg-45-xvi" n="45:xvi"/>bridle it; but has run panting and trotting meanly by the side of it, patting its stupid neck &#x02026; anxious he, only not to be kicked away, not just yet: oh, not yet for a little while!&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:48). More generally, TC did not wish to weaken the polemical aspect of &#x0201C;Shooting Niagara&#x0201D; by introducing philosophical considerations into the essay. Rankled by newspaper editorials that sought to soften his image following his <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date> Edinburgh rectorial address, and revolted by the chatter about his &#x0201C;&#x02018;recent return of popularity greater than ever&#x02019;&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 104), with merciless zeal he littered the essay with the crude racist rhetoric of &#x0201C;The Negro Question&#x0201D; and <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>. Disraeli was a &#x0201C;superlative Hebrew Conjurer, spell-binding all the great Lords, great Parties, great Interests of England &#x02026; and leading them by the nose, like helpless mesmerised somnambulant cattle&#x0201D;; the American Civil War caused &#x0201C;deluges&#x0201D; in which &#x0201C;half a million &#x02026; of excellent White Men, full of gifts and faculty have torn and slashed one another&#x0201D; in order to emancipate &#x0201C;three million absurd Blacks&#x0201D;; and John Stuart Mill&#x02019;s Jamaica Committee was a &#x0201C;knot of rabid Nigger-Philanthropists, barking furiously in the gutter&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:11, 7, 12). But to his consternation and disappointment, TC&#x02019;s &#x0201C;howling doggeries&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:353) were received with less hostility than he hoped. The critical reception in the press was generally favorable, and he was almost relieved to inform John A. Carlyle, <date when="1867-08-10">10 August 1867</date>, that Thomas Woolner had &#x0201C;left me <supplied>[a]</supplied> Newspaper tirade&#x0201D; (unidentified). On <date when="1867-08-27">27 August</date>, he ruefully admitted to Lady Ashburton that &#x0201C;the poor people seem to have rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> it wonderfully;&#x02014;but what <hi rend="italic">good</hi> can it do them?&#x0201D;</p>
<p>Most papers acknowledged TC&#x02019;s importance as an antagonist, even if they recoiled from some of his more extreme views. In light of the bank foreclosures, railway shares scandals, and general economic distress that had dominated the headlines throughout <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>, commentators were sympathetic to his attacks against the immorality of &#x0201C;Free Trade.&#x0201D; As the <hi rend="italic">Daily Mail</hi> asserted in an editorial of <date when="1867-12-31">31 December 1867</date>, &#x0201C;Extravagant as is the language &#x02026; with which M<hi rend="small-caps">r</hi>. C<hi rend="small-caps">arlyl</hi><hi rend="small-caps">e</hi> endeavours to startle the world into a sense of its perilous state, his diagnosis is essentially right. &#x02026; Getting and spending, we have laid waste our powers; and they can be restored only by a return to the principles of plain living and high thinking from which the nation has departed.&#x0201D; But if &#x0201C;Shooting Niagara&#x0201D; stimulated debate about the immorality of capitalism, it also reinforced a reactionary trend in British public opinion that had surfaced following the Indian Mutiny of <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>. The earlier middle-class idealism associated with abolitionism and the freeing of slaves had been eclipsed by a ubiquitous prejudice against minorities in general and people of color in particular. This prejudice had been exacerbated by the American Civil War, the Morant Bay rebellion in Jamaica, and the Fenian raids in Canada, all of which were condemned by TC in &#x0201C;Shooting Niagara.&#x0201D; Though personally ambivalent about slavery, he was not inclined to compromise his <pb id="pg-45-xvii" n="45:xvii"/>harsh and bullying invective in the essay. To an alarming extent, the &#x0201C;master race&#x0201D; narrative that he had obliquely articulated in his earlier diatribes against &#x0201C;Quashee&#x0201D; had been absorbed by a number of Colonial Office administrators, most notably Governor Eyre.</p>
<p>However reluctantly, TC was intimately allied with the institutional forces of repression. By firing off another volley of &#x0201C;black eccentricities and consuming fire&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 149) in &#x0201C;Shooting Niagara,&#x0201D; he was providing them with a vital piece of political propaganda with which they could justify their authoritarian and racist policies. He was also strengthening the case for harsher measures at home, which he believed were desperately needed in the wake of the Hyde Park riots and the monster meetings organized by Edmund Beales and the Reform League. With perverse logic, TC hoped that a &#x0201C;Drill-Sergeant&#x0201D; of Eyre&#x02019;s stature would compel &#x0201C;the entire Population &#x02026; into co&#x000F6;perative movement, into individual behaviour, correct, precise, and at once habitual and orderly as mathematics&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:40). TC&#x02019;s relative silence about Eyre in his correspondence reflected his disappointment with the public efforts to defend the governor. From the outset he thought that the Eyre Defence Committee had been a half-hearted entity, and he later regretted its unaggressive and overly legalistic approach. Knowing that the Jamaica Committee planned to sponsor private prosecutions against Eyre and his associates for murder, TC decided in late <date when="1867-12-00">December 1867</date> to draft a petition to the House of Commons. J. A. Froude was of the view that the petition was not used but Gillian Workman argues that it was printed and may have been presented.</p>
<p>TC was confident that the document, penned in the name of &#x0201C;L<hi rend="small-caps">oyal</hi> C<hi rend="small-caps">itizens</hi>, <hi rend="small-caps">from many towns and regions of the</hi> B<hi rend="small-caps">ritish</hi> E<hi rend="small-caps">mpire</hi>, <hi rend="small-caps">on behalf of</hi> E<hi rend="small-caps">dward</hi> J<hi rend="small-caps">ohn</hi> E<hi rend="small-caps">yre lately governor of</hi> J<hi rend="small-caps">amaica</hi>,&#x0201D; would rejuvenate the cause of the Eyre Defence Committee.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">2. Gillian Workman, &#x0201C;Thomas Carlyle and the Governor Eyre Controversy: An Account with Some New Material,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Victorian Studies</hi> 18.1 (<date when="1974-09-00">Sept. 1974</date>): 98.</note> Perhaps uneasy about the negative consequences of his racist language, TC condemned &#x0201C;seditious Incendiaries, of black-savage type or of white-savage&#x0201D; with equal weight in the document and kept the focus on Eyre&#x02019;s character and actions. His primary aim was to vindicate the governor&#x02019;s reputation and to restore him to his job. In his journal on <date when="1867-01-15">15 January</date>, TC recorded completing the petition. The &#x0201C;tide&#x0201D; of opinion in support of Eyre seemed to herald a wider public backlash against reform: &#x0201C;Beales &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, Fenian mad-dogs, disgusted even the stupid public with the <hi rend="italic">mob</hi> side of things.&#x0201D; But his hopes were thwarted. On <date when="1867-02-27">27 February</date>, he stoically commented, &#x0201C;Eyre&#x02019;s Petit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, &#x02018;thanks&#x02019; from the Com<hi rend="italic">ee</hi> for it; &#x02018;very fine and true&#x02019; &#x26;c, but is not to be tried, I perceive,&#x02014;and gladly acquiesce, in silence.&#x0201D; Justifying his initiative, he remarked, &#x0201C;Have done my <pb id="pg-45-xviii" n="45:xviii"/>bit of duty, or seeming-duty, and there will be no further noise or <hi rend="italic">fash</hi> from it. Eyre&#x02019;s self down here: visibly a brave, gentle, chivalrous and clear man (whom I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> make <hi rend="italic">Dictator</hi> of Jamaica for the next 25 years,&#x02019; were I now King of it!)&#x02014;has withal something of the <hi rend="italic">Grandison</hi> in him, mildly perceptible; that is his <hi rend="italic">limiting</hi> condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>Unwittingly, TC had betrayed some of the same abstracting tendencies as Samuel Richardson&#x02019;s exemplary but na&#x000EF;ve Christian gentleman, Sir Charles Grandison. In his quest to enlist Eyre as a &#x0201C;flowing light-fountain&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">On Heroes</hi> 4) of the age, he had misread certain signs of his times. The majority of &#x0201C;loyal citizens&#x0201D; may not have approved of the attempts to prosecute Eyre for murder, but there were widespread doubts about his illegal execution of George William Gordon and his brutal suppression of the rebellion. The government&#x02019;s cautious handling of Eyre&#x02019;s excesses mirrored this uncertainty. With similar hesitation, the Defence Committee gauged that such Quixotic declarations as TC&#x02019;s petition would be of little help in securing immunity for the governor. TC himself accepted that this &#x0201C;bit of duty, or seeming-duty&#x0201D; had released him from any further obligations to act on Eyre&#x02019;s behalf. He was relieved to be free of the burden, but he was demoralized by the Committee&#x02019;s rejection.</p>
<p>When he turned his thoughts away from public affairs, TC inevitably sought shelter in recollections of JWC and their shared past; the possibility of compiling a collection of JWC&#x02019;s letters gave TC a firm purpose in an otherwise bleak existence; his journal returns to this several times in the course of this volume; for example, <date when="1867-11-30">30 November 1867</date>: &#x0201C;I have sometimes tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x02018;One thing you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do, write some record of <hi rend="italic">Her</hi>, make some select<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of her <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you think, justly, among the cleverest ever written), and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> none but y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self can <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> understand) &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">3. TC&#x02019;s journal entries on JWC&#x02019;s letters and his collecting of them can be found through the index under &#x0201C;Carlyle, Thomas&#x02014;Collecting JWC&#x02019;s letters.&#x0201D;</note> On <date when="1868-01-23">23 January 1868</date> TC was grateful to receive a letter from Thomas Erskine of Linlathen, who recounted a visit he had made to JWC&#x02019;s &#x0201C;dearest&#x0201D; old servant and friend, Betty Braid, living in Edinburgh. TC was touched by Erskine&#x02019;s kind gesture: &#x0201C;Often had I thought of asking you to do such a thing for me by some opportunity, but, in the new sad circumstances, never had the face. &#x02026; The world has not many shrines to a devout man at present, and perhaps in our own section of it there are few objects holding more authentically of Heaven and an unseen &#x02018;better world&#x02019; than the pious loving soul and patient heavy-laden life of this poor old venerable woman. The love of human creatures one to another, where it is true and unchangeable, often strikes me as a strange fact in their poor history, a kind of perpetual Gospel, revealing itself in them; sad, solemn, beautiful, the heart and mother of all that can, in any way, <pb id="pg-45-xix" n="45:xix"/>ennoble their otherwise mean and contemptible existence in this world&#x0201D; (TC to TE, <date when="1868-01-23">23 Jan. 1868</date>).</p>
<p>Sensing that the Eyre campaign would be his last foray into public controversy, he professed to be done with politics. But on the same day that he heard from Erskine, TC also received a request from James Hutchison Stirling, asking him for help in applying for the chair of moral philosophy at Edinburgh University, which had recently become vacant. Still holding the post of rector, TC might have been expected to keep his distance from the matter. Yet Stirling was important to him, both personally and professionally. Before embracing the philosophy of Hegel, Stirling had been a disciple of TC&#x02019;s. He was trying to do for German philosophy in the <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>s what TC had achieved for German literature in the <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>s, and the older man was quietly proud of the &#x0201C;elective affinities&#x0201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">4. Title of Goethe&#x02019;s third novel, <hi rend="italic">Die Wahlverwandtschaftena,</hi> (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>).</note> between them. In championing German literature and philosophy, these Scottish outsiders had exposed the parochialism of the British intellectual elite. TC had already written a testimonial for Stirling when he applied (and was rejected) for the chair of moral philosophy at Glasgow University in <date when="1866-04-00">April 1866</date>. On this occasion, he was prepared to intervene more directly in the selection procedure. On <date when="1868-01-22">22 Jan. 1868</date>, TC wrote to his friend David Laing, whom he had appointed as his Assessor on the University Court in <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>, and raised the topic of Stirling&#x02019;s candidacy in blunt terms: &#x0201C;I hope you mean to elect Stirling for Moral Philosophy Profess<hi rend="italic">r</hi>? Hope, or I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> rather say, <hi rend="italic">suppose</hi>, not being myself a Metaphysic<hi rend="italic">n</hi> at all. &#x02026; Stirling does himself perfectly understand what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> he writes of German Metaphysics, and this is hitherto altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> a novelty among Brit<hi rend="italic">h</hi> men.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>In his reply to Stirling&#x02019;s second request, TC told him that he had heard of his candidacy, &#x0201C;and have been frequently thinking of it since&#x0201D; (TC to JHS, <date when="1868-01-23">23 Jan. 1868</date>). He was familiar with Stirling&#x02019;s most recent writings, including his studies of Hegel and Sir William Hamilton, and he was keen to offer him encouragement and support: &#x0201C;I have myself little right to speak on such a subject: quite an alien from all Metaphysic for the last forty years, and ignorant at present what the Electors specially intend their Moral-Philosophy Professor to accomplish for them.&#x0201D; Nonetheless, TC offered a clear endorsement of Stirling&#x02019;s writings. Echoing the words that he had used the day before to Laing, TC declared that &#x0201C;in regard to German Metaphysics &#x02026; you &#x02026; have yourself understood every word you put down &#x02026; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> &#x02026; is more than can be said of any Brit<hi rend="italic">h</hi> man that had gone before you on those topics&#x0201D; (TC to JHS, <date when="1868-01-23">23 Jan. 1868</date>). Though reluctant to get too involved, Carlyle felt that it was incumbent on him to promote Stirling&#x02019;s nomination. Laing continued to keep him informed about the election. In early June he reported rumors that Stirling&#x02019;s chances of success were diminishing. Writing to John A. Carlyle, <pb id="pg-45-xx" n="45:xx"/><date when="1868-06-11">11 June 1868</date>, TC announced: &#x0201C;At Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I hear from Laing there is mad electioneering &#x02026; <hi rend="italic">Stirling</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Grant</hi> [Sir Alexander Grant] &#x26; &#x02018;Stirl<hi rend="italic">g</hi> very uncert<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x02019; (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is something!).&#x0201D;</p>
<p>On <date when="1868-06-16">16 June 1868</date> TC decided to become more directly involved. In a letter to Stirling, he explained that &#x0201C;the news I now hear from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is of such a complexion, so dubious, and so surprising to me; and I now find I shall privately have so much regret in a certain event,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seems to be reckoned possible, and to depend on one Gentleman of the Seven,&#x02014;that, to secure my own conscience in the matter, a few plainer words seem needful.&#x0201D; The cause of TC&#x02019;s concern originated in the news that at a meeting of the Curators held on <date when="1868-06-04">4 June 1868</date>, Adam Black, publisher, politician, and one of the four representatives chosen from the Edinburgh Town Council, had requested that an extension be granted to Henry Calderwood to submit his testimonials. Objections were raised by several Curators that the agreed upon deadline for applications was <date when="1868-06-01">1 June</date>, but Black overruled these. Concern began to grow that Calderwood was being allowed to breach the rules because he was a minister in the United Presbyterian Church. TC&#x02019;s old nemesis&#x02014;the &#x0201C;beggarly Twaddle&#x0201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:372) of religious intolerance&#x02014;was once again reasserting its influence. He was determined to intervene in the process in order to defend his own deeply held beliefs about religion, science, and freedom.</p>
<p>In his letter to Stirling, TC went much further than he previously had in endorsing the philosopher&#x02019;s credentials: &#x0201C;To what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I have said of you already therefore, I now volunteer to add, That I think you not only the one man in Britain capable of bringing Metaphysical Philosophy, in the ultimate, German or European, and highest actual form of it, distinctly home to the understanding of British men who wish to understand it; but that I notice in you farther, on the Moral side, a sound strength of intellectual discernment, a noble valour and reverence of mind, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seems to me to mark you out as the man capable of doing us the highest service in Ethical Science too; that of restoring &#x02026; the Doctrine of Morals to what I must ever reckon its one true and everlasting basis (namely the Divine or Supra-<hi rend="italic">sensual</hi> one), and thus of victoriously reconciling and rendering identical the latest Dictates of Modern Science with the earliest Dawnings of Wisdom among the Race of Man&#x0201D; (TC to JHS, <date when="1868-06-16">16 June 1868</date>). TC was reaffirming his faith in what his friend the scientist John Tyndall called &#x0201C;transcendent wonder&#x0201D; (John Tyndall, <hi rend="italic">New Fragments</hi> [<date when="1892-00-00">1892</date>] 387), which constituted the core of Teufelsdr&#x000F6;ckh&#x02019;s doctrine of &#x0201C;Natural Supernaturalism.&#x0201D; This was not merely a protest in favor of &#x0201C;German or European&#x0201D; thought against British insularity, but it was also an attack on Scottish Presbyterian narrow-mindedness.</p>
<p>It was a sign of TC&#x02019;s resolution that he encouraged Stirling to share the contents of his letter with Black, &#x0201C;a man of solid sense, independence, <pb id="pg-45-xxi" n="45:xxi"/>probity and public spirit,&#x0201D; as well as &#x0201C;to any other person.&#x0201D; Somewhat unwittingly, he had become heavily embroiled in the controversy. In his journal, <date when="1868-06-16">16 June 1868</date>, TC recorded, &#x0201C;Wrote a final note to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Stirling, in hope of securing his elect<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to Chair of &#x02018;Moral Philosophy&#x02019; there. Very unwilling; but, in a sort, constrained to it,&#x02014;to <hi rend="italic">decide</hi> in that way, and send <hi rend="italic">it</hi> as my poor word or opin<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on the matter. Dreary duty (old <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> shaking &#x26;c.); dreary enough, but clear, demanding to be done!&#x0201D; Desperate to take advantage of TC&#x02019;s rather extravagant encomium, Stirling had 25 copies of the testimonial printed for giving to the Curators and friends, and from this TC&#x02019;s letter was printed in several newspapers, including the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Evening Courant</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>; Stirling sent TC copies of the latter newspapers, <date when="1867-06-19">19 June</date>, apologizing for the printing of TC&#x02019;s letter. But for the second time in six months, TC found himself on the losing side of a debate. At a meeting of the Curators held on <date when="1867-06-18">18 June</date>, Calderwood was elected professor of moral philosophy. The next day the <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> reported the result, concluding with the statement that &#x0201C;<supplied>[o]</supplied>ne of the candidates for the professorship was Dr. Stirling, who was spoken of very favourably, but not nominated.&#x0201D; Below the article was published TC&#x02019;s letter of <date when="1867-06-16">16 June</date> to Stirling. In an indignant editorial the paper declared that &#x0201C;the testimony of Mr Carlyle is enough to show what <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of Professor Dr Stirling would have made. But Mr Carlyle has only expressed an opinion which is shared by all competent students of philosophy both here and in Germany.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>In Cheyne Row fresh complications arose in relation to John Forster&#x02019;s plans to commission George Frederic Watts to do an oil portrait of TC (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680506-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1868-05-06">6 May 1868</date></ref>). Watts had begun work on his portraits of TC, <date when="1867-06-00">June 1867</date>. Forster intended to use an engraving of the painting for a frontispiece to the Library Edition. On <date when="1868-05-06">6 May 1868</date>, TC informed Forster, &#x0201C;I went to Watts the day after you spoke; Watts is ready with the readiest, will &#x02018;take a sitting&#x02019; qu&#x000E0;m prim&#x000F9;m [as soon as possible]: only he wanted first to <hi rend="italic">see you</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the size&#x0201D; (for the various sizes of Watts&#x02019;s three portraits of TC, see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680506-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1868-05-06">6 May 1868</date></ref>). TC noted in his journal, <date when="1868-05-24">24 May 1868</date>, &#x0201C;Forster urged and ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> urged me, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take no denial: &#x02018;Sit to Watts; Picture for me!&#x02019; and I am actually sitting; went Friday last, am to give my second sitting tomorrow. Very mournful to me, sad and wearisome and dreary, this too,&#x02014;such joy and interest as there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been over it, &#x26; never ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> now can be! Alas, alas.&#x02014;But I feel this to be faintly a kind of quasi-<hi rend="italic">duty</hi> also,&#x02014;perhaps, perhaps?&#x02014;nay I had at bottom a kind of &#x02026; feeble <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> that Watts, who has been aiming towards it for ten years past, sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> finally paint me. &#x02026; It will cost Forster &#x000A3;150, poor Forster; but he has bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it on himself, and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take no denial.&#x0201D; In <date when="1868-07-00">July 1868</date> TC escaped from the sittings, having finally accepted his brother John&#x02019;s advice to seek treatment for his hernia from James Syme, a leading Edinburgh expert in the field. Forster went to see the commissioned portrait; on <date when="1868-07-29">29 July</date> he wrote to TC, registering his approval: &#x0201C;All that your face contains is by no means there&#x02014;want of softness<pb id="pg-45-xxii" n="45:xxii"/>&#x02014;want of sweetness&#x02014;of humour&#x02014;many wants&#x02014;But much that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> there rendered very grandly indeed&#x02014;a face of a prophet&#x02014;very sorrowful&#x02014;very powerful&#x02014;wanting the correction I would have him give to it &#x02026; but certainly the material for the greatest picture of you that has ever been done.&#x0201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">5.

<p>To TC&#x02019;s surprise and relief, the surgery was a success. In a letter of <date when="1868-08-02">2 August 1868</date> that he sent to Forster from Syme&#x02019;s Edinburgh residence, Millbank, TC wrote, &#x0201C;I really now think I shall derive some considerable benefit from it [Syme&#x02019;s procedure]. Thank Heaven, and the excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Syme, skill-fullest and help-fullest of men, a man of the finest frank good-hum<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, too, and honest as &#x02026; the best Scotch oatmeal!&#x0201D; TC described in his journal an excursion he took with his brother John to JWC&#x02019;s gravestone in Saint Mary&#x02019;s Church, Haddington: &#x0201C;Yesterday (Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> <date when="1868-07-25">july 25</date>), drove with John, quietly as possible to Haddington,&#x02014;to visit the sacredest place to me under this sky, the Grave of Her I shall see no more. The sight of the place cut me asunder with an uncontrollable emot<hi rend="italic">n</hi> sharper &#x26; sadder than any I have yet had: &#x02018;Oh my lost Darling, and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is all the Lodging thou now hast, where to welcome me!&#x02019; Tears flowed visibly; but I soon reflected, &#x02018;Well, it was <hi rend="italic">victory</hi> as well as death; a strenuously sore battle, right nobly <hi rend="italic">won</hi>!&#x02019; and a glow of pious <hi rend="italic">pride</hi> for my incomparable one, ran thro&#x02019; me, mingling with the endless sorrow wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is beyond remedy.&#x02014;I return for Dumfries tomorrow; and <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be thankful to God that lent me, poor me, the noblest of all woman as my Fellow-Pilgrim in this world. Yea, yea.&#x0201D; After Edinburgh, Carlyle went on to Dumfries, where he convalesced at the home of his sister Jean Carlyle Aitken from late <date when="1868-07-00">July</date> to mid-<date when="1868-09-00">September</date>. He later told Lady Ashburton that &#x0201C;I was totally silent and secluded all my 8 weeks at Dumfries&#x0201D; (TC to Lady A, <date when="1868-10-18">18 Oct. 1868</date>). From Dumfries he visited Thornhill and Nithbank, remembering JWC&#x02019;s last visits there, and Craigenputtoch &#x0201C;mainly for Her sake too&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680820-TC-WT-01">TC to WT, <date when="1868-08-20">20 Aug. 1868</date></ref>).</p>
<p>In late <date when="1868-09-00">September</date> TC returned to Chelsea in the company of his niece Mary Aitken. He meant to resume work on the collection of JWC&#x02019;s letters, but he was plagued by sleeplessness and lack of energy. The start of the general election campaign in <date when="1868-10-00">October 1868</date> aroused his contempt for the &#x0201C;fanfaronade&#x0201D; of parliamentary democracy. In Chelsea, the local candidate George <pb id="pg-45-xxiii" n="45:xxiii"/>Odger, a radical republican and an ally of John Stuart Mill, was pressured into withdrawing from the race by a more moderate candidate. Mill led a chorus of outrage, but TC was unmoved. His own failed initiatives on behalf of Eyre and Stirling buttressed his contempt for organized politics. On <date when="1868-10-18">18 October</date> he commented sardonically to Lady Ashburton: &#x0201C;<supplied>[T]</supplied>he very flagstones here are inviting me (in green paint) to &#x02018;vote for Odger&#x02019; &#x02026; but, alas, to me what form of comeliness is in Odger that I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vote for him? My tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, on Mill&#x02019;s sending &#x000A3;25 to &#x02018;dear Mr Odger,&#x02019; was &#x02018;Good Heavens, were Odger a candidate for <hi rend="italic">Purgatory</hi> (there to have the brutalities sins and uglinesses burnt out of him and done away with, then I might perhaps subscribe a few pounds; but as candidate for <hi rend="italic">Parliament</hi>&#x02014;What can one do but muse in expressive silence over Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and him!&#x02019;&#x0201D;</p>
<p>But a ray of light pierced the darkness of his existence in late <date when="1868-10-00">October</date>, when he received a visit from Kitty Kirkpatrick Phillipps, the &#x0201C;Hindoo Princess&#x0201D; of his earliest days in London. In his reminiscence of Edward Irving (completed <date when="1867-01-00">January 1867</date>), TC had recalled meeting her at the Bullers in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>: &#x0201C;a strangely complexioned young Lady, with soft brown eyes and floods of <hi rend="italic">bronze</hi>-red hair, really a pretty-looking, smiling and amiable, though most foreign bit of magnificence and kindly splendour&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 280). Buoyed by her presence at Cheyne Row, TC wrote on <date when="1868-10-24">24 October 1868</date> to thank her for &#x0201C;emerging on me from the dusk of ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, like a Dream become real! It set me thinking for many hours, upon times long gone, and persons and events that can never cease to be import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and affecting to me.&#x0201D; He regretted that she had come at twilight, preventing him from seeing her &#x0201C;except in <hi rend="italic">chiaroscuro</hi>, while you talked&#x0201D; and hoped that she would return soon, &#x0201C;when the <hi rend="italic">lights</hi> are better disposed to us.&#x0201D; Yet TC was able to invest this &#x0201C;Dream&#x0201D; with particularity through the strength of his own vivid memory.</p>
<p>Several days later, she sent him three photographs of herself, including of the miniature of her done in the <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>s by the Scottish painter Andrew Robertson. TC was thrilled to receive them and arranged to have them hung on the east wall of his dressing closet: &#x0201C;They are very beautiful to me; full of old interest, and awaken many tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> and recollect<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>. The miniature by Robertson, that shadow of the first glance I had of you, in the summer afternoon, 44 years ago, is splendid! A veritable <hi rend="italic">Indian Princess</hi>, become an English Lady as well,&#x02014;very strangely rises over my poor horizon too! That afternoon in Pentonville, the <hi rend="italic">new Drawing-room</hi> there; still more, the Desk &#x26;c at Birmingham, of all this, I shall have much to say and ask, if opportunity arise,&#x02014;as you promise&#x0201D; (TC to CP, <date when="1868-10-31">31 Oct. 1868</date>). She kept her &#x0201C;promise,&#x0201D; and in a subsequent letter, she told TC the story of her father&#x02019;s conversion to Islam and his marriage to a Hyderabadi noblewoman. On <date when="1868-12-01">1 December 1868</date> TC replied, &#x0201C;Thank you very much for that excerpt of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Father&#x02019;s letter,&#x02014;and for the clear acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of that romantic, strange and tragical adventure altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> <pb id="pg-45-xxiv" n="45:xxiv"/>you were so kind and trustful as to impart to me. I have long wished to know authentically ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it; and tho&#x02019; I <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> all the Pieces as you bid, am not likely ever to forget it.&#x0201D; Marooned as he felt he was in the world, TC could still derive some comfort from the excavation of his own private past.</p>

<p><date when="1867-07-00"><hi rend="italic">July</hi></date>. TC writes his brother John A. Carlyle about John Rutter Chorley&#x02019;s death (<date when="1867-06-29">29 June 1867</date>). His nephew James Aitken Jr. has found employment with Stauros Dilberoglue; TC is reading Emerson&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1867-07-01">1</date>). He rides with Maude Stanley (<date when="1867-07-02">2</date>), and attends Chorley&#x02019;s funeral (<date when="1867-07-04">4</date>), which leaves him restless and unwell. TC and his brother John have discussed John moving into Cheyne Row, but having separate apartments; both are cautiously non-committal. TC also wonders about Maggie Welsh &#x0201C;or some such figure&#x0201D; continuing to live with him (<date when="1867-07-05">5</date>). A bequest of &#x000A3;500 comes from the estate of John Chorley; TC inquires of Henry Chorley if it should not be put to some better use (<date when="1867-07-11">11</date>). He writes Betty Braid in Edinburgh on JWC&#x02019;s birthday (<date when="1867-07-14">14</date>). He professes no enthusiasm at the prospect of a Library Edition of his <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (<date>16</date>).</p>
<p><date when="1867-08-00"><hi rend="italic">August</hi></date>. TC writes his brother James Carlyle about Craigenputtoch (<date when="1867-08-01">1</date>). A friendly letter to David Laing in Edinburgh (<date when="1867-08-03">3</date>) includes TC&#x02019;s wish that a good compact history of Scotland could be produced, which he would consider &#x0201C;an invaluable Book.&#x0201D; He resumes correspondence with Lady Ashburton, but declines her invitations to visit Addiscombe and Melchet &#x0201C;unless the Lady of them were there!&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-08-05">5</date>) She is still embroiled in court cases over the inheritance of Lord Ashburton&#x02019;s American property. TC writes a friendly letter to Caroline Davenport Bromley (<date when="1867-08-07">7</date>). He is approached by a supporter of Governor Edward Eyre, but is uncertain whether he should become further involved (<date when="1867-08-09">9</date>). To his brother John he confesses he is &#x0201C;very idle; indeed unfit for exert<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, so perpetually worried with <hi rend="italic">dyspepsia</hi>&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-08-10">10</date>); the previous evening he unexpectedly has many visitors (Giuseppe Mazzini, Emilie Venturi, Thomas Woolner, and William Clarke) and finds it &#x0201C;a noisy ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>; worse than a <hi rend="italic">bad Book</hi> considerably!&#x0201D; He writes John Forster (<date when="1867-08-17">17</date>) and praises his biography of Landor. He emphatically agrees with Charles Ward on the question of Right of Search of seagoing vessels (<date when="1867-08-19">19</date> [<date when="1867-08-20">20</date>]). An enlarged <hi rend="italic">Shooting Niagara: and After?</hi> is being printed as a pamphlet. A long and confidential letter to Lady Ashburton (<date when="1867-08-27">27</date>) strongly suggests she come back to England after all her travels and settle down. He is preparing an appendix for the new edn. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1867-08-31">31</date>). Forster takes the labor of proofreading and dealing with publishers off TC&#x02019;s hands.</p>
<p><date when="1867"><hi rend="italic">September</hi></date>. TC thanks Sir James Naesmyth for the offer of a copy of Cranach&#x02019;s portrait of Luther (<date when="1867-09-05">5</date>). He tells Lady Lothian that &#x0201C;<supplied>[t]</supplied>he Town was never <pb id="pg-45-xxxviii" n="45:xxxviii"/>emptier&#x0201D; (<date>14</date>), but he finds the lack of company perfectly acceptable; &#x0201C;I am become a very crazy bit of goods.&#x0201D; He thanks Naesmyth for the &#x0201C;Luther,&#x0201D; safely arrived (<date when="1867-09-16">16</date>). He roundly denies a rumor that he is to stand for parliament for Chelsea (ca. <date when="1867-09-21">21</date>). TC resumes riding; he finishes the proofs of <hi rend="italic">Shooting Niagara</hi> (<date when="1867-09-21">21</date>), but his health is still precarious. He tries to help Charles Ward with publishing a paper (<date when="1867-09-22">22</date>). He writes Forster about Eliza Forster&#x02019;s health and Mary Cunningham&#x02019;s death (<date when="1867-09-023">23</date>). Maggie Welsh leaves for Liverpool (<date when="1867-09-26">26</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">October</hi>. TC sends Henry Larkin a copy of <hi rend="italic">Shooting Niagara</hi> and invites him to call (<date when="1867-10-03">3</date>). He sends money to James Aitken Jr. for James Baillie. He is very glad to know Lady Ashburton has arrived in Addiscombe (<date when="1867-10-07">7</date>); he proposes a visit (<date when="1867-10-08">8</date>) and will gladly go to Melchet too. He discusses with John A. Carlyle the idea of selling his railway shares (<date when="1867-10-07">7</date>). He has been reading Kant&#x02019;s letters &#x0201C;with considerable weariness for most part&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-10-08">8</date>). He complains to Caroline Davenport Bromley about the new railway and housing developments that spoil the road to Addiscombe. <hi rend="italic">Shooting Niagara</hi> is selling well ([ca. <date>9</date>]). TC has decided to buy more railway shares; he confides to his brother John his health problems; Henry Larkin has been offering practical help (<date when="1867-10-15">15</date>). TC thanks David Buchanan for the safe arrival of an opossum rug from Australia sent from Henry Parkes (<date when="1867-10-18">18</date>). He declines an invitation to a banquet in Dickens&#x02019;s honor; he gives further publishing advice to Charles Ward (<date when="1867-10-20">20</date>). He writes Parkes to thank him for the &#x0201C;&#x02019;Possum rug,&#x0201D; and tells him he has sent him a copy of <hi rend="italic">Shooting Niagara</hi> (<date>22</date>). Lady Alford invites TC to Belton House in Lincolnshire; TC had hoped Lady Ashburton would accompany him but she does not (<date when="1867-10-25">25</date>); he accepts the invitation for <date when="1867-11-01">1 Nov.</date>, later changed to <date when="1867-11-02">2 Nov.</date> Frederic Chapman pays TC royalties. TC asks Chapman to ask Robson to send him printed sheets of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> which he still has in stock so he can correct them before they are reprinted for the uniform edn. J. A. Froude visits after a long absence, and they go walking together (<date when="1867-10-31">31</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">November</hi>. TC apologizes to William Allingham for mistakenly snubbing him earlier (<date when="1867-11-01">1</date>). TC writes John A. Carlyle from Belton House reporting he is well but sleeping badly (<date when="1867-11-03">3</date>). He returns to Chelsea (<date when="1867-11-09">9</date>) after sleeplessness; saying he &#x0201C;might as well have staid at home&#x0201D; (<date when="1867-11-09">9</date>). He asks Larkin to visit to help with finding a belt for a truss (<date>10</date>). To Lady Ashburton he describes the failure of his Belton House visit and his regret at missing Miss Bromley in London.

TC is proofreading the sheets of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> and complains about the quality of the printing (<date when="1867-11-21">21</date>). His brother James arrives in Chelsea (<date when="1867-11-22">22</date>); Jean Aitken is also expected soon for a visit. TC writes a friendly letter to Ann Welsh with a &#x0201C;Luther&#x0201D; photograph; he looks forward <pb id="pg-45-xxxix" n="45:xxxix"/>to Jean&#x02019;s company during the dark winter weeks (<date>23</date>). Emilie Venturi offers to copy MSS for TC, but he regrets that at present he has nothing for her to do; he hopes she will visit when his sister Jean Aitken arrives (<date when="1867-11-26">26</date>). He writes urgently to Larkin for help with his truss (<date when="1867-11-28">28</date>). He pays Robert Scott Tait for photographs (<date when="1867-11-30">30</date>).</p>

TC invites John Hill Burton to visit (<date when="1867-12-10">10</date>). He writes William B. Chorley about John Rutter Chorley&#x02019;s literary works and to praise him as a first-rate Spanish scholar who ought to have written a definitive history of Spanish Literature (<date when="1867-12-18">18</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">January</hi>. TC writes his sister Mary Austin a New Year&#x02019;s letter, enclosing a check for &#x000A3;10 and complaining about cold and ill health (<date when="1868-01-01">1</date>). TC and his sister Jean start the New Year together in Chelsea, and send good wishes to brother John and brother in law James Aitken who are paying a New Year visit to Scotsbrig. TC encourages his brother John to persevere with his translation of Dante (<date when="1868-01-02">2</date>). He thanks Laing in Edinburgh for a book on Scottish history (<date when="1868-01-22">22</date>). He is having bookplates made (<date when="1868-01-22">22</date>) and writes Thomas Erskine and thanks him for visiting Betty Braid (<date when="1868-01-23">23</date>). J. H. Stirling is applying for an Edinburgh professorship and hopes TC will support him (<date when="1868-01-23">23</date>). TC attends John Tyndall&#x02019;s lecture on Michael Faraday at the Royal Institution (<date when="1868-01-24">24</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">February</hi>. TC asks his brother John to check on his bank account in Dumfries. He feels his life in Chelsea is &#x0201C;sad, lethargic, obstructed and useless&#x0201D; (<date when="1868-02-11">11</date> [<date when="1868-02-12">12</date>]). He sends a New Year&#x02019;s gift to his sister Janet Hanning in Canada (<date when="1868-02-14">14</date>) and thanks Lord Northbrook for an invitation to Stratton Park, saying he cannot come at present (<date when="1868-02-18">18</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">March</hi>. He thanks Gavan Duffy for his kindness to a young man who had asked TC for help in finding work in Australia, and comments on the challenges facing that country. He comments on the troubles in Ireland, and condemns J. S. Mill&#x02019;s recent essay on the subject (<date when="1868-03-01">1</date>). He writes to thank Forster (who has been unwell) for news from Chester (<date when="1868-03-02">2</date>); for himself, he finds &#x0201C;lumber of <hi rend="italic">Dyspepsia</hi> clogging all my steps.&#x0201D; He writes Lady Ashburton (3) hoping she will soon be returning to England. He is asked by Arthur Helps for an appraisal of William Knighton as a translator, but says he has no information (<date when="1868-03-06">6</date>). He accepts an invitation to dinner at the Westminster Abbey Deanery if Froude will collect him by cab and accompany him (<date when="1868-03-16">16</date>). His sister Jean leaves Chelsea (<date when="1868-03-14">14</date>), returning home via Liverpool after a three-month visit, and TC feels lonely; he commiserates with his brother John who is suffering from indigestion (<date when="1868-03-16">16</date>). He has decided that his U.S. investments and stocks should all be held in the <pb id="pg-45-xl" n="45:xl"/>British Linen Co. bank and hopes John will help with this (<date when="1868-03-16">16</date>). He had become involved in a charity subscription, and writes to Jean in panic when he cannot find some documents and checks that Jean had tidied away for him (<date when="1868-03-19">19</date>). He grants permissions for extracts from his works to be used in an educational book of German translations (<date when="1868-03-24">24</date>). He thanks his brother John for good news about Mme. Jean Otthenin; he asks for medical advice; he asks about the possibility of getting a photograph of JWC&#x02019;s grave in Haddington (<date when="1868-03-24">24</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">April</hi>. TC discusses publishing arrangements with Forster (<date when="1868-04-03">3</date>). He declines an invitation from Lady Stratford de Redcliffe, having just agreed to a short visit to Lord Northbrook (<date when="1868-04-10">10</date>). He visits (<date when="1868-04-10">10</date>) Forster who is in poor health (<date when="1868-04-12">12</date> [<date when="1868-04-11">11</date>]). He again declines an invitation from Lady Stratford de Redcliffe, since he expects an imminent visit from his brother John &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">en route</hi> for Vichy&#x0201D; (<date when="1868-04-15">15</date>), then leaves for his visit with Lord Northbrook; after a poor start, it turns out to be a success (<date when="1868-04-18">18</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868-04-23">23</date>). He sends two photographs to Henry Parkes, one for himself and one for Duffy (<date when="1868-04-27">27</date>). John A. Carlyle arrives in Chelsea (<date when="1868-04-29">29</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">May</hi>. Brother John having arranged for TC&#x02019;s U.S. investments to be held in his Scottish bank, TC closes his contact with Charles Butler, who has been managing his affairs, and thanks him cordially (<date when="1868-05-06">6</date>). He apologizes for missing a visit to Forster, feeling &#x0201C;too stupid, low and weary&#x0201D; (<date when="1868-05-06">6</date>). He discusses the details of the forthcoming Library Edition of his work with Forster (<date when="1868-05-06">6</date>), with Chapman (<date when="1868-05-08">8</date>), and with Robson (<date when="1868-05-11">11</date>). Brother John is in Vichy but, as TC tells his sister Jean, he is too bothered with the Library Edition to join him; he thanks her for family news. She invites him to Scotland for his health, but he thinks of his native land now only as &#x0201C;<supplied>[a]</supplied> place of <hi rend="italic">tombs</hi>&#x0201D; (<date when="1868-05-18">18</date>). He rides to Robson&#x02019;s to consult about the new edition (<date when="1868-05-19">19</date>). George Frederic Watts resumes his portrait of TC commissioned by Forster (<date when="1868-05-022">22</date>). TC thanks Laing who has sent him a book of ballads, and asks him for details about the ballad &#x0201C;Tranent Muir&#x0201D; and the personalities it contains (<date when="1868-05-22">22</date>). TC is sending Robson copy for the Library Edition (<date when="1868-05-26">26</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">June</hi>. TC says he is unable to help Provost Swan of Kirkcaldy, a very old friend, with a pension application to Disraeli for another mutual friend. He fears he may not see Scotland at all this year with the pressure of the Library Edition (<date when="1868-06-02">2</date>). Brother John, his health improving, is leaving Vichy to travel in France, and TC sends advice and suggestions: for himself, &#x0201C;stagnat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and delay&#x0201D; and botheration with the new edition are aggravating his poor health (11). Watts has his third sitting for the portrait (<date when="1868-06-11">11</date>). TC absolutely declines a party invitation (<date when="1868-06-13">13</date>) citing poor health. He writes encouragingly to J. H. Stirling in Edinburgh in support of his application for a professorship (16) but has to write again (26) to sympathize when the application fails. He urgently writes sister Jean for a copy of a particular edn. of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, and sends photographs of their mother&#x02019;s portrait (<date when="1868-06-30">30</date>).</p>
 <p><pb id="pg-45-xli" n="45:xli"/><hi rend="italic">July</hi>. TC declines an invitation from Sir John Naesmyth (<date when="1868-07-08">8</date>). He writes a testimonial to James Dowie praising his skill in providing comfortable shoes (<date when="1868-07-10">10</date>). He leaves for Edinburgh (<date when="1868-07-11">11</date>) for a hernia operation, recuperating at the surgeon James Syme&#x02019;s home. He visits JWC&#x02019;s grave at Haddington (<date when="1868-07-25">25</date>) and then moves to his sister Jean&#x02019;s in Dumfries (<date when="1868-07-27">27</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">August</hi>. In Dumfries he enjoys silence, &#x0201C;kept utterly <hi rend="italic">au secret</hi>&#x0201D; (<date when="1868-08-02">2</date>). He goes with John to visit Thornhill and Nithbank (ca. <date when="1868-08-18">18</date>), and to Craigenputtoch (ca. <date when="1868-08-25">25</date>). He acknowledges the gift of a copy of a hitherto unknown Cromwell letter (<date when="1868-08-20">20</date>) but is content to remain quiet in Dumfries and will deal with it on return to London.</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">September</hi>. Beginning to think of returning to London, TC declines an invitation to visit Thomas S. Spedding at Mirehouse on the way (<date when="1868-09-10">10</date>). &#x0201C;In my life,&#x0201D; he tells Forster, &#x0201C;I have never spent 7 idler weeks&#x0201D; (<date when="1868-09-17">17</date>). He leaves for London (<date when="1868-09-19">19</date>) with Mary Aitken his niece, who (he finds) &#x0201C;does me some good&#x0201D; (<date when="1868-09-26">26</date>). Forster visits (<date when="1868-09-20">20</date>), also Tyndall, but TC misses seeing Caroline Davenport Bromley (<date when="1868-09-26">26</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">October</hi>. TC writes James Aitken Jr. with his bi-annual check for Baillie, still on condition of secrecy. Mary is &#x0201C;discovering London&#x0201D; and doing well (<date when="1868-10-02">2</date>). TC writes Caroline Davenport Bromley about her horse Comet, who had fallen with TC; he felt Comet was no longer fit to be ridden. Moncure Conway visits (<date when="1868-10-04">4</date>). &#x0201C;I am fairly a little <hi rend="italic">better</hi> for my Scotch journey,&#x0201D; he tells brother John, though he also admits that riding is now (after his accident with Comet) &#x0201C;fairly <hi rend="italic">over</hi>&#x0201D; for him. The Library Edition, with many difficulties, moves forward, as does G. F. Watts&#x02019;s portrait, although its completion is too late to be engraved for the first vol. of the edition (<date when="1868-10-09">9</date>). J. H. Stirling has been invited to work in the U.S., and TC writes him stating the pros and cons without giving any final advice (<date >12</date>). He writes a friendly letter to Lady Ashburton, declining to join her at Malvern but glad of her news. He has seen Tyndall, but Froude has not yet returned to London. There was to be &#x0201C;immense printing&#x0201D; of the Library Edition &#x0201C;after Jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1st&#x0201D; [<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>], he reports (<date when="1868-10-18">18</date>). He thanks Charles Ward for his annual gifts, and invites him to Chelsea (<date when="1868-10-21">21</date>). He writes to Kitty Kirkpatrick (now Catherine Phillipps), telling her how glad he was to see her again after so many years, though declining to visit her in Sandhurst (24); she sends three photographs that, he tells her, awaken many memories of their earlier friendship (<date when="1868-10-31">31</date>). He resumes sittings for Watts&#x02019;s portrait (<date when="1868-10-26">26</date> and ca. <date when="1868-10-30">30</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">November</hi>. TC goes for what he hopes will be his final sitting for Watts (<date when="1868-11-02">2</date>). TC has asked his Dumfries relatives to collect and sort JWC&#x02019;s letters to them (ca. <date when="1868-11-04">4</date>). Maria Price pays a final visit two days before her marriage (<date when="1868-11-10">10</date>). TC encourages J. H. Stirling to accept the offer of work in the U.S. (<date when="1868-11-16">16</date>). He calls on Catherine Phillipps (<date when="1868-11-19">19</date>), who is visiting London. He asks Henry Larkin to <pb id="pg-45-xlii" n="45:xlii"/>visit Robson the printer in connection with the Library Edition (<date when="1868-11-23">23</date>). He tells his brother John of Bryan Waller Procter&#x02019;s birthday dinner (<date when="1868-11-21">21</date>), Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s visit (<date when="1868-11-25">25</date>), and thanks him for inspecting repairs at Craigenputtoch and settling the financial affairs there (<date when="1868-11-26">26</date>).</p>
 <p><hi rend="italic">December</hi>. TC thanks R. H. Shepherd for his edition of William Blake&#x02019;s poems (<date when="1868-12-01">1</date>) and invites him to walk with him. Forster&#x02019;s sister is very unwell, but he nevertheless invites TC and Mary Aitken for a birthday dinner for TC; TC feels too unwell to go, complaining of prolonged insomnia (<date when="1868-12-01">1</date>). He arranges to meet Catherine Phillipps, still in London (<date when="1868-12-02">2</date>). Mary Aitken, writing for her uncle, thanks Meta Wellmer for her birthday wishes and a valuable Richter letter. &#x0201C;His right hand shakes so much that it makes writing a great task to him now&#x0201D; (<date when="1868-12-03">3</date>). The students at Edinburgh ask for a valedictory speech from their rector but TC politely declines, sending them his best wishes (<date when="1868-12-06">6</date>). He writes cordially to Edward FitzGerald and would be glad to see him again (<date when="1868-12-07">7</date>). He thanks Arthur Helps for the gift of <hi rend="italic">Realmah</hi>; Helps, too, he would be glad to see again (<date when="1868-12-14">14</date>). He writes a long letter to Gavan Duffy about the state of Australian politics (<date when="1868-12-19">19</date>). With surprise and pleasure he accepts honorary membership of the Society of Antiquaries in Edinburgh (<date when="1868-12-20">20</date>). He writes to comfort John Forster on the death of his sister Elizabeth (<date when="1868-12-20">20</date>), and attends the funeral (<date when="1868-12-24">24</date>). TC writes to his brother John sharply criticizing Stirling&#x02019;s writing about contemporary poets. He receives accounts from John Aitken and Mary Austin about JWC&#x02019;s visits to Dumfries <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>&#x02013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date> (<date when="1868-12-22">22</date>).

After 2 years, especially after 3 months, of bitter suffering wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had made him long to be gone. I did not know a more punctually correct man; nor, with his rigourous almost shrewish temper, a more carefully honest. A man of clear sharp intellect, and fine practical faculties &#x26; habits; of extensive accurate scholarship, and d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> inquiry; one of the best informed men to be met with,&#x02014;decidedly the best <hi rend="italic">read</hi> man I knew in London, or indeed elsewhere in these last years. Has left no &#x02018;fame&#x02019; or general recognit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, in any kind, behind him,&#x02014;which so many thousands of far less worth are sounding on the &#x02018;popular gale&#x02019; (if that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at all help them!) Poor Chorley read constantly for reading&#x02019;s sake, and had not the least regard for &#x02018;sounding&#x02019; on anybody&#x02019;s tongue or mind. He knew <hi rend="italic">classic</hi> languages like a scholar, with great accuracy: modern too and their Literatures, German, especially French, and Spanish most of all, with an accuracy and completeness quite peculiar to him here. Poor fellow, he sat for many months (I think, his last considerable effort in the world), compiling, with a methodic clearness and correctness all his own, some Spanish Catalogue, I think of Lope de Vega mainly, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> in Spain itself, I understand, has been considered supreme in that kind. <hi rend="italic">Ay de mi</hi>, no more will he rise up,&#x02014;pen joyfully flung down, sharp wiry face relaxing into a sunny smile, &#x26; kind right hand held on, on my entrance at any time.

<p>I often urged him to write a book on Spanish literature&#x02014;some good book, worthy of himself and of his wide and exact knowledge, but he would never consent to try. He could have written like few men on many subjects, but he had proudly pitched his ideal very high. I know no man in these flimsy days, nor shall ever again know one, so well read, so widely and accurately informed, and so completely at home, not only in all fields of worthy literature and scholarship, but in matters practical, technical, naval, mechanical &#x26;c., &#x26;c., as well.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I was so entirely out of sorts, so jumbled to pieces by the various bits of confusions wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had occurred, that I absolutely couldn&#x02019;t write as I had intended; but was obliged to sit, or lounge ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> on sofas, all day; reading poor <pb id="pg-45-3" n="45:3"/>stuff to keep away still worse, and help me to endure a very ugly kind of headache, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is happily a rare visitor. On Tuesday (4 to 7 p.m) I had gone out on a long ride, by <hi rend="italic">old</hi>ish appoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> with &#x0201C;Miss Stanley&#x0201D;<note n="1" noteref="17">Maude Alethea Stanley had written, <date when="1867-06-09">[9] June</date>, from 6 Cloisters, Windsor: &#x0201C;I have a great wish to make acquaintance with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Oliphant of whom dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle used often to speak to me &#x26; said she would introduce me to her. Might I ask you for a letter of introduction to her as I believe she lives near here&#x02014; If this is troubling you too much do not answer me / Now the weather is fine I shall next week hope to have a ride with you. I go back to town the end of this week.&#x0201D; TC wrote on the envelope: &#x0201C;&#x02018;Hon.

 (Maude, the sole one now unmarried, a fine good-humoured, well-bred, but by no means very sprightly or original y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> lady); this, with other misfortunes bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a sleepless night (instead of all the benefit I had anticipated): so that Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> was very idle and worthless;&#x02014;in the tail of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> came a second bad night; half or quarter sleep, awake in <hi rend="italic">too</hi> good time &#x26;c &#x26;c: so that by the time I returned from the sad funct<hi rend="italic">n</hi> at Chester-square<note n="2" noteref="18">John Rutter Chorley&#x02019;s funeral.</note>
 and onwards (10 a.m to breakfast) I was completely done for! Today I am much better; free of the vile headache; &#38;, striving all I can to isolate myself from the whole world (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seems to be <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> set on plucking me to pieces, so far as it meddles with me at all,&#x02014;such a perpetual tide of despicable booing blockheadisms, and insipid ravenous begging, adoring, lion-hunting and other unmixedly <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> specimens, as often raises my lamentable astonish<hi rend="italic">t</hi>!), I hope to take a long walk in silence somewhere, as d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> after sunset, an hour or two of silent (very poor) reading; and so to get quite round &#x0201C;to <hi rend="italic">par</hi>&#x0201D; ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Nothing, I see well enough, is wrong with my health <hi rend="italic">except</hi> the perennial undiminishing, rather increasing <hi rend="italic">inability</hi> to digest any devisable kind of food: but this of course means that Everything is wrong;&#x02014;and that one&#x02019;s Life ought to <hi rend="italic">end</hi> soon, if it cannot considerably improve!&#x02014;</p>
<p>We did the last offices to poor Chorley on such terms as there were; nothing c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have excused me for <hi rend="italic">not</hi> going. The real hour (after ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 4 or 5 inquirings) turned out to be 8&#xbd; a.m. at Ch<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Square: the whole comp<hi rend="italic">y</hi> consisted of 4 mourners, the 2 Bro<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>,<note n="3" noteref="19">Henry Fothergill and William Brownsword Chorley.</note>

TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1867-07-14">14 July</date>: &#x0201C;Chorley&#x02019;s funeral I attended as proposed above. Two Brothers, the Doctor (Woolmer, a good &#x26; solid man), with myself a fourth; these, with 3 servants, were all the mourners. In spite of the sore &#x02018;headache&#x02019; &#x26;c &#x26;c, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not regret going: and now I am very thankful that I went&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).</note>
 and I, all in one carriage with 3 serv<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> in another behind us: 7 persons in all. I was exact to my hour, everything was exact; the Dr is an intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> man,&#x02014;spoke kindly of you; poor Chorley&#x02019;s disorder <pb id="pg-45-4" n="45:4"/>he said was properly <hi rend="italic">Myalgia</hi> (waste &#x26; <hi rend="italic">misery</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">muscles</hi>), proceeding considerable from over-exert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (walks in the morning &#x26;c) and under-nourish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (wretched <hi rend="italic">south-american beef</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he had largely used for soup &#x26; otherwise); he seemed to have a real respect for poor Chorley, told me his last month was passed mainly in <hi rend="italic">prayer</hi>, in thanks to God for the prospect of a speedy release, speedy and calm. His last day, he said, was like &#x0201C;the melting away of snow,&#x0201D; no pain or struggle in it, they c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not even tell for some time when the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> had come. The 2 Brothers did not say very much, but were affecting to me in their depth of sorrow; Will<hi rend="italic">m</hi> wore a stern look gen<hi rend="italic">lly</hi> silent; Henry had the power of tears, &#x26; spoke a little oftener. They had determined on this entirely tacit mode of funeral,&#x02014;proudly disdaining to ask the world for any recognit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of Him who was gone;&#x02014;their unreasonable-looking hour proceeded, I suppose, from the wish to let Woolmer be home to his work as usual. &#x0201C;An upright man, and an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> scholar&#x0201D;: that, with name and dates, is all that H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> will put upon the Tomb;&#x02014;very right, as I told him in reply.

At my <hi rend="italic">real</hi> grief for poor Chorley I have not yet <hi rend="italic">arrived</hi>, but am daily arriving. Very pathetic when I consider him; very sad and strange this rapid &#x26; continual disappearance of friend after friend, since April gone a year! What you said to me of his &#x0201C;bursting into tears&#x0201D;<note n="7" noteref="23">Unexplained; John A. Carlyle had possibly visited Chorley while staying with TC in the spring.</note>
 is a thing one cannot forget ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. I do not believe I have now anybody in London that cares as much ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me; tho&#x02019; several care much more ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me than I feel to deserve of them. Enough, enough. I will go out into the Garden (all shaved &#x26; swept lately), and take a turn in the fine summer breeze before proceeding farther.&#x02014; &#x02014;</p>
<p>I did not reply to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> criticism of the &#x0201C;Two apart<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>,&#x0201D; tho&#x02019; there might be some reply; but I felt that in the practical substance of the thing you were probably right, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> alone is the import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> point. Certainly <hi rend="italic">noises</hi> are not the rock it need split on. The &#x0201C;sitting room,&#x0201D; exact size of our old drawing room is or c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be made a very good apart<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for a man and his Books; and as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is occupied only from breakfast to supper, my care ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the noises of it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be highly insignificant! With regard to the Bedroom too, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> on some points I am not so <pb id="pg-45-5" n="45:5"/>sure of, that of noise overhead is not one of these: there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> floors, two rows of joists ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a foot apart, bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> it &#x26; me; and by no chance have I ever heard the women in it yet. With sawdust or the like, if needful, I have no doubt everything might be perfectly <hi rend="italic">deafened</hi>, if that were all. But it is too certain you and I have given one another considerable annoyance, &#x26; have never yet been able to do well <hi rend="italic">together</hi>;&#x02014;that is the nature of the <hi rend="italic">beasts</hi>; they cannot change that; and ought to consider it well, in their eagerness to be nearer one another, and get the benefit of mutual affect<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, now that each of them, one of them above all, needs it more and more!<note n="8" noteref="24">Since JWC&#x02019;s death TC and John A.

<p>I knew generally or understood, long since, by some casual hint, or transient quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to me by Him whom we have lost, that the bulk of his property (after an Event wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it was not likely I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> ever witness) was to go in Library Charities,&#x02014;I think he said, to <hi rend="italic">The Literary Fund</hi>.<note n="4" noteref="33">The Royal Literary Fund, a benevolent fund to help writers in financial difficulties, founded in <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date> by Reverend David Williams (<date when="1738-00-00">1738</date>&#x02013;<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>;  <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29494"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>). TC recommended writers to the fund for assistance several times; for example, see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530312-TC-OB-01"><sic>28:69&#x02013;70</sic><corr>TC to OB, <date when="1853-03-12">12 March 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 And once ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, long afterwards, I remember to have heard him speak, in reply to some quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of mine, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Brother William&#x02019;s commercial misfortunes.<note n="5" noteref="34">William B.

He was a qualified physician, but it is not known if he ever practiced.</note>
 Now if it be that there is any lack, or chance of such, in that <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> quarter, permit me to urge with emphasis, that, as there is no shadow of it <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> gratify me in a much higher and richer degree if I might be permitted to lay down <hi rend="italic">there</hi> the actual Sum of Money in quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; retaining <hi rend="italic">here</hi> the soul and essence of it, that is to say, the sacred memory of it, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be among the perennial jewels of my life, more precious far than any gold!&#x02014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-45-7" n="45:7"/>Forgive me for urging this on y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> most candid, impartial and deliberate <hi rend="italic">considerat</hi>n.

And I will say no more of it here; but solemnly leave it with you.</p>
<p>Or if you wished to exchange a few words on it with me,&#x02014;as you daily go driving for health, you can nearly every day find me here till 3 p.m. and after 8 p.m. I leave it with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>; but I consider it a thing that greatly and even sacredly concerns us both.</p>

 and all is fallen lonesome and mostly silent there. Write me a short word yourself as the year advances.</p>
<p>As to me I have nothing worth complaining about on the score of bodily <pb id="pg-45-9" n="45:9"/>health, all this is much what it was before my great sorrow fell upon me. Nor in regard to the latter either will I make any complaint, for I think there is some thing blessed in it withal. I try to be very quiet and mostly solitary and find the company of my own thoughts upon the Past better than any thing the Present will yield me.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There is probably no one more desirous than I am that you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> succeed in the object of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Deputat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and surely it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be an agreeable fact to me that any help of mine had forwarded the matter! But I am in great doubt whether I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to go; or indeed can with the least advantage either to Mr Eyre<note n="1" noteref="89">The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported that in the House of Lords, Tues. <date when="1867-08-13">13 Aug.</date>, Lord Shrewsbury questioned the government as to whether it would undertake to defend Edward John Eyre, ex-governor of Jamaica (see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660823-TC-HH-01"><sic>44:43&#x02013;45</sic><corr>TC to HH, <date when="1866-08-23">23 Aug. 1866</date></corr></ref>) against any future prosecutions, now that the attempt by the Jamaica Committee to prosecute Eyre for murder had been aborted. Replying for the government, Richard Grenville (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x02013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1498"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 3d duke of Buckingham and Chandos, secretary for the colonies, explained that Eyre &#x0201C;has had the misfortune to be arraigned by certain persons, and the legal proceedings must take their course, and the evidence be sifted for the facts, before the Government can form any opinion as the course to be pursued by them with reference to Mr. Eyre&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1867-08-14">14 Aug.</date>).</note>
 or anybody,&#x02014;myself included, so totally ignorant of all details; by habit, so secluded, averse to public exhibit<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, and even in such a state of nerves and health, were there nothing more. I fear you must not count on me.<note n="2" noteref="90">Lord Shrewsbury had intended speaking on the subject the previous Tues. (<date when="1867-08-06">6 Aug.</date>), but had adjourned his speech till the following week due to &#x0201C;the very thin attendance then in the House, and not seeing any leading member of the Opposition present&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1867-08-07">7 Aug.</date>); perhaps he was trying to encourage more people to come and witness the debate.</note>
</p>
<p>But if possible I will try to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> you before Tuesday, and get some clearer view of the thing on hand, and what <hi rend="italic">practicabilities</hi> are in it. Believe me</p>

Masson, the editor of <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x02019;s</hi>, was in London during <date when="1867-06-00">July</date>; he visited TC and also mediated between TC and the printers; he wrote, <date when="1867-07-19">19 July</date>: &#x0201C;A proof should reach you by book-post today. I do not know how you will find it printed, as the bulk of the copy had gone to the printers before I received your note, &#x26; I had to let them find out the divisions for themselves. Please note the &#x02018;juggler&#x02019; near the beginning&#x02014;which word you told me might go instead of the actionable &#x02018;swindler.&#x02019; You will settle this to your own mind.

Masson continued, <date when="1867-07-23">23 July</date>: &#x0201C;I have remained in town today, but go off in an hour or two. At the printers&#x02019; this afternoon I found that the matter on hand, with the additional bit expected, could make 17&#xbd; pages; and I arranged as nearly as possible for that fit. I do not think there will be any difficulty now between you &#x26; the printers; but, should you be in the least put about, I left directions with them by which I think they will be able to satisfy you. / They have somehow put in &#x02018;Falls&#x02019; on the title after &#x02018;Niagara.&#x02019; You will doubtless delete this in your proof. / If you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> finish with them tomorrow (Wednesday), it would be convenient. / With grateful thanks &#x26; dear memories of our late meetings.&#x0201D; Alexander Macmillan (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x02013;<date when="1896-00-00">96</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/63220"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), publisher, wrote to TC, <date when="1867-08-01">1 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;It is a very great pleasure to me to have your excellent article in our magazine.

Happily the masses have something to say to the arrangement and perhaps they will prefer their liberty, though starving, to the pampered imprisonment of body and mind which is the Chelsea panacea. &#x02026; These, indeed, are awful times which the philosopher of Chelsea has undertaken to correct, and on the whole we think it will be better to shoot Niagara, than to adopt the Heaven inspired plans which he recommends.&#x0201D;</note>

 above a week ago. &#x0201C;Go on with it&#x0201D;? Heavens, can there be any doubt or question as to that! It promises to be one of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> most agreeable Books: throughout it is faithfully done; and with solid conformity to the Plan necessitated by the conditions prescribed to you, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed, perhaps better than any other w<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, agrees with the nature of the thing. If you were to give at all the Correspondence of <hi rend="italic">Southey and Landor</hi> (and apart from orders by poor L<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on the subject,<note n="2" noteref="102">Landor corresponded with Robert Southey (<date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x02013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26056"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet, regularly from their first contact in <date when="1808-00-00">1808</date> until Southey&#x02019;s death. Many of Southey&#x02019;s letters had already been published. Introducing the section of their letters, Forster wrote: &#x0201C;Landor&#x02019;s [to Southey] &#x02026; were at his own request wholly reserved for the use now about to be made of them. And &#x02026; such portions only of Southey&#x02019;s will here be given as have not before been printed&#x0201D; (Forster, <hi rend="italic">Landor</hi> 1:210).</note>
 it was well worth giving), you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have done it with more conciseness, lucidity, candour &#x26; fidelity. I was much struck with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> steady fairness towards L<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; for or ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, you stand by the truth, and neither extenuate nor exaggerate: that is a fundamental trait! For the rest I found the Book really entertaining; as I predict many of my fellow-creatures will certainly do. I flagged nowhere; not even in the <hi rend="italic">Gebir</hi> sect<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,<note n="3" noteref="103">Walter Savage Landor, <hi rend="italic">Gebir: a poem in seven books</hi> (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>). Forster included several extracts from the poem, and his own opinion: &#x0201C;its merit lies &#x02026; in the passion and intellect pervading it every where, in its richness of detail and its descriptive power. Style and treatment constitute the charm of it&#x0201D; (Forster, <hi rend="italic">Landor</hi> 1:82). He also quoted various reviews and comments, including Southey&#x02019;s remark, in a letter to Joseph Cottle (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x02013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6407"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), author and bookseller: &#x0201C;some of the most exquisite poetry in the language&#x0201D; (Forster, <hi rend="italic">Landor</hi> 1:108).</note>
 tho that tried me most. I don&#x02019;t know <hi rend="italic">Gebir</hi> as a whole; nor indeed anything of it, except y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Extracts, and what you and Southey say. To myself there is recognisable a ponderous emphasis of proud strength, exquisite polish, too, &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x02014;but here, as in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> L<hi rend="italic">r&#x02019;s</hi> Poems and Prose, it is strength and polish as of <hi rend="italic">marble</hi> or <hi rend="italic">steel</hi>; no heart beating within the ribs of it: fierce exaggerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; little or nothing that I can fully like, or accept as quietly <hi rend="italic">true</hi>.&#x02014; His worth as a writer, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say, did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> entitle him to two volumes <hi rend="italic">from you</hi>: but there is something so unexampled, partly monstrous, in the wild pride, irascibility, ferocity and magnanimity of the indomitable man,<note n="4" noteref="104">For a comparison of TC&#x02019;s and Landor&#x02019;s characters, see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670406-TC-JRU-01"><sic>44:186</sic><corr>TC to JRU, <date when="1867-04-06">6 April 1867</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 that I will take cheerfully as many volumes as you like on that head;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">one</hi> volume most cheerfully of all, if you can condense yourself into one, and do it like its predecessor!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I heartily agree with everything you say or feel on the <hi rend="italic">Right of Search</hi>;<note n="1" noteref="106">Ward was presumably responding to John Stuart Mill&#x02019;s parliamentary speech of <date when="1867-08-05">5 Aug.</date>, in which he argued for the reinstatement of the right of search of foreign vessels at sea, which Britain, France, Austria, Prussia, Russia, Sardinia, and the Ottoman empire among others had renounced in the Declaration of Paris, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; the (non-binding) declaration stated that the signatories would not seize enemy goods on neutral vessels, nor neutral goods on enemy vessels. However with many European powers increasing their military and naval capabilities, Mill believed that in the event of a war Britain would be at a disadvantage because of her much smaller population, and therefore should maintain the right of search as a necessary weapon: &#x0201C;[W]e have put away the natural weapon of a maritime nation &#x02026; we have abandoned the right recognised by international law &#x02026; of warring against the commerce of our enemies. &#x02026; We have given up our main defence; but the other Powers who are parties to the transaction have not given up theirs; they have divested themselves not of their special means of warfare, but of ours&#x0201D; (John Stuart Mill, <hi rend="italic">Collected Works</hi> 28:221). Mill argued that as a matter of honesty, Britain should repudiate the agreement now, as it is certain she would repudiate it in time of war, and would then be accused of breaking faith.</note>
 but I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> absolutely nothing more of it than you do (nay, not so much); nor c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I express it with more emphasis or clearness. Not to add that my persuasion is, <hi rend="italic">No</hi> force of argument, or other considerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> than that of a bayonet in their back w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> impel these official people to stir in such a matter.</p>
<p>I am in great bustle just now ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> other things; and must not add a word more.</p>

<p>I hope you are setting out from those Dauphiny Countries,<note n="1" noteref="108">Dauphin&#x000E9; or Dauphiny, province, SE France.</note>

<salute>Dear Lady Lothian,</salute>
<p>Some little while ago Miss Jewsbury forwarded me a very kind Note of inquiries ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> myself, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you had been so humane as address to her; &#x26; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not read with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> thankfulness and real satisfact<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.

The hot days of August &#x26;c were not kind altogether, nor are yet, to the <hi rend="italic">Dyspeptic</hi> Interests, and to what depends on these; but perhaps this too may prove beneficently critical, part of Nature&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">hygiene</hi> in the fit season, and be ultimately profitable if one wait. The Town was never emptier; in general I call on no person whatever; am neither cheered nor disturbed by any face I ever saw before;&#x02014;and this is by no means so bad a bargain as many people think. The pavements are clean, <pb id="pg-45-30" n="45:30"/>and nearly vacant; the skies (if any wind blow) are beautifully clear, not intolerably murky at any time: one may have the company of one&#x02019;s own tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> if they are sad and sombre, <hi rend="italic">needn&#x02019;t</hi> be base and stupid, as human company sometimes is!&#x02014; Froude is somewhere in Kerry, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Killarney<note n="1" noteref="151">See <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670827-TC-LLA-01">TC to LLA, <date when="1867-08-27">27 Aug.</date></ref></note>

Carlyle wrote, <date when="1867-09-06">6 Sept.</date>, of his trip the following day to Portpatrick, village on W coast of Wigtonshire, SW Scotland, to visit Mr. Douglas, Edinburgh bookseller and publisher (possibly George Douglas, 69 George St.); on Douglas, John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1867-09-13">13 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;He is the best-hearted &#x26; most genial of publishers I have met with, &#x26; would have made a figure had he been in a wider sphere than Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. As it is, he always makes it his first consideration&#x02014;according to capacity &#x26; environment&#x02014;whether the books he is invited to publish have any real worth in them, &#x26; takes great pains in getting everything he undertakes correctly &#x26; well done.&#x0201D; John may have been considering buying or renting a house in Portpatrick, or even considering a place for TC, as he wrote, <date when="1867-09-17">17 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;Several houses are already empty, &#x26; one or two large ones well-built will probably be sold. I have asked Mr Douglas to enquire about them. There would be no fear of noise in them, unless some one were to keep cocks, as the R.W. Station is beyond the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> end of the town, &#x26; no trains from 7 p.m. till 10.15 a.m. The best house to sell is in the main street just before it turns, on the left, to harbour. &#x26; Douglas has the house next to it.&#x0201D;</note>
 Tell Jean I at <pb id="pg-45-34" n="45:34"/>one time had a glow of enthusiasm ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> her Peckham poor young ladies<note n="2" noteref="167">Jean Aitken wrote, <date when="1867-09-19">19 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;I mentioned in a former note that Jim knew two nieces of Sir J Naesmyth. It came about this way. &#x02026; Jim&#x02019;s landlady. &#x02026; told [him] about this McQueen family&#x02014;that they were Scotch, had been in affluent circumstances but their mother had lost all her money by the failure of that Great London Bank. How the poor mother had never recovered the shock of being reduced to beggary. They had rented a house in Peckham&#x02014;one of the girls teaching a little School in one of the rooms the other sister keeping the house (by the help of a little servant lassie) &#x26; attending to her poor shattered, bedridden mother&#x02014;&#x02018;might perhaps be induced to take a quiet lodger &#x02026; as they were poor.&#x02019; But Jim was to be very <hi rend="italic">canny</hi> in speaking to them at first as they had nothing of the landlady about them &#x26; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not take him on any terms unless they happened to like the look of him. &#x02026; They were all favourably impressed with each other &#x26; it was settled that he was to come. James thought them very superior people both of them. The teacher one is a fine, tall, noble looking girl <hi rend="italic">frightened</hi> Jim just at first by her grand bearing but in a short time thawed into a most frank, kind, warmhearted girl. The other one was quite different a caring considerate douce little body nice looking too. James seemed very sorry about them when he came home. The poor mother dying shortly after James left. Hearing that Jas was to be in their Uncle&#x02019;s neighbourhood at the fishing during his Holiday James had promised to take photographs of Mrs McQueen &#x26; her two daughters &#x26; call at Posso but James&#x02019;s face was so ill with that eruption I spoke of he could not fulfil his promise to the poor girls, w<hi rend="italic">ch</hi> I was sorry for as it would surely been a great pleasure to this good old gentleman to know that he has two such kinswomen left to him. &#x02026; I don&#x02019;t think there has been any estrangement between them &#x26; their Uncle&#x02014;except by the fact of his living so much in Germany he seems to have lost sight of them of late years. Jas says they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> on no account let their Uncle know they were in straitened circumstances or ask help of him above all <hi rend="italic">wd</hi> not like him to know they had to take lodgers. &#x02026; I have been contriving <hi rend="italic">many</hi> ways to help these good brave young women &#x26; all have failed hitherto; for Mary w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have gone to Posso instead of James &#x26; now she is not to go back to Peebles.

He must be in the Hig<supplied>[h]</supplied>lands; but <pb id="pg-45-38" n="45:38"/>the Letter will follow him, and you shall see the ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.<note n="4" noteref="186">Masson enclosed another letter, also dated <date when="1867-09-23">23 Sept.</date>, addressed to TC, intended for passing on to Ward: &#x0201C;I shall be very glad to see Mr Ward&#x02019;s paper. &#x02026; I will give it my best consideration; and if, after all, it should not suit, Mr Ward, I hope will not put a wrong construction upon that event. There are so many elements in judging for the Magazine that it does not always happen that I can accept for <hi rend="italic">it</hi> what I like, or am struck by, privately.&#x0201D; TC wrote on the top of the letter above Masson&#x02019;s address: &#x0201C;Address is &#x02018;Professor Masson &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x02019; T.C. (<date when="1867-09-24">24 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>).&#x0201D; Masson lived at 3 Roseberry Cres., Edinburgh.</note>
 I left him in perfect liberty, &#x0201C;Needn&#x02019;t even see <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Paper, unless with hope.&#x0201D; A clear transact<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on all hands. Better wait for M.&#x02019;s ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi>.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> improve the Paper, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> you throw it rightly into <hi rend="italic">Dialogue</hi> form. But that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take trouble, perhaps not quite a little. At least and lowest, I promised you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have it copied fair.</p>
<p>For the rest, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> n&#x02019;t for my own part, expect any great result from it; or in regard to the practical &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Right of Search</hi>&#x0201D; quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi> any perceptible result at all. From it, and from many like it, considerable result might follow&#x02014;not in regard to &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Right of Search</hi>&#x0201D; only or chiefly! To say truth, I myself care little ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x0201C;Right of Search&#x0201D; at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. No chances of our <hi rend="italic">asserting</hi> it theoretically just now, and in case of any deadly or thoroughly dangerous war, the feeblest &#x0201C;Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x0201D; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be driven into <hi rend="italic">practising</hi> it for very life.<note n="5" noteref="187">See <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670820-TC-CAW-01">TC to CAW, <date when="1867-08-20">19 [20] Aug.</date></ref></note>
 Nor do I think Engl<hi rend="italic">d</hi> will much conquer in any war likely to rise soon; but rather that she has every chance to be beaten (till she become very much less a blockhead than now!)&#x02014;and even that there is probably no other thing but beating and ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> beating that will teach her!&#x02014; &#x02014;</p>
<p>On the whole, there rises here (as was to be expected) a <hi rend="italic">discrepancy</hi> bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r Two Ideals</hi>; that of Commercial Success (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you <hi rend="italic">consciously own</hi>) and that of Literary (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you don&#x02019;t quite), especially in this kind.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind little Note: it was a fine spiritual condiment to breakfast, <pb id="pg-45-39" n="45:39"/>the other morning;&#x02014;and really did me good; tho&#x02019; the news it bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> were, as usual with us, but a <hi rend="italic">mingled</hi> yarn!</p>

 from her tone. Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am not quite surprised at either, knowing the nature of <hi rend="italic">dyspepsia</hi>, as few of mortals do. Change is, at <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, apt enough to discompose one&#x02019;s poor nerves still farther; and the wretched <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> says so, the most eloquent of evil demons! Half a century&#x02019;s unintermitted experience persuades me always there is little or nothing of immediate <hi rend="italic">danger</hi>; but for sordid misery, and weight upon the spirits, no doubt too in slowly wasting one&#x02019;s strength (you may see how slowly!), this beggarly disease has no fellow.<note n="3" noteref="193">TC wrote, <date when="1867-09-30">30 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;Trouble especially ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> bodily matters (greatly aggravating spiritual d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>) of my own; <hi rend="italic">health</hi>, I know not whether growing worse, or even not growing slowly and obscurely <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, has been decidedly more <hi rend="italic">troublesome</hi> all summer; so that I often wistfully look forward to the <hi rend="italic">one panacea</hi> that is certainly ahead&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).</note>

<p>An hour before, I had done the last <hi rend="italic">slip</hi> of &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Niagara</hi>,&#x0201D;&#x02014;some 50 pages there will be in all; and it is probable you will hear from Fr<hi rend="italic">k</hi> Chap<hi rend="italic">n</hi> this week ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it: at least so I charged him, and so he promised me, &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">before</hi> publishing&#x0201D;;&#x02014;and that was our one condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, all <hi rend="italic">else</hi> to be left to him and what judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> he make of it.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I can very freely testify to every one whom it concerns that whenever you have come to talk with me, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has happened a good few times in former years, you seemed to me a cheerful good-natured rational and honest-minded man.<note n="1" noteref="200">Presumably Knighton had asked TC for some kind of testimonial; he ended his &#x0201C;Conversations with Carlyle&#x0201D;: &#x0201C;In <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> I left Chelsea, and saw Carlyle again only for a short time on my return from India in <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>. He was then broken down by sorrow, a mere shadow of his former self.&#x0201D;</note>
 With regard to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> practical or official qualities, performances and aptitudes, it is of course another kind of experience than mine that must testify,&#x02014;as, I flatter myself &#x26; have no reason to doubt, it amply can.</p>

 Well well, all shall be well that <hi rend="italic">ends</hi> well: right glad am I to hear of you on English ground, on any terms.</p>

 the utter silence of this House (tho so little of speech that is of worth to me ever comes to it now) is more or less surprising, and the reverse of &#x0201C;cheering,&#x0201D; hitherto.

<p>Tomorrow, then, at 4, unless the day prove bad. Tell Marykin<note n="8" noteref="217">Mary Florence Baring.</note>
 not to shriek <pb id="pg-45-44" n="45:44"/>at sight of me; and that I will kiss <hi rend="italic">her</hi> little hand, and spare her all trouble. <salute>Y<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> ever truly</salute></p>

<p>I find that solitude and one&#x02019;s own sad and serious thoughts (though sometimes in bad days it is all too gloomy) is almost as good as anything I get. The most social of mankind I could define myself, but grown old, sorrowful, and terribly difficult to please in regard to his society. I rode out on Comet to Addiscombe, stayed two hours for dinner, and rode home again by moodlight and lamplight. There are now three railways on that poor road<note n="1" noteref="238">The railway lines at the time in the Addiscombe area were the London, Brighton, and South Coast line (which stopped at Addiscombe Stn., opened <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), the South Eastern line, and the London and South Western line.</note>
 since I was last there, and apparently 3,000 new diggings, lumber heaps and new villas <hi rend="italic">rising</hi>, dirty shops <hi rend="italic">risen</hi>, and costermongers&#x02019; carts, &#x26;c.&#x02014;a road, once the prettiest I knew for riding, and now more like Tophet<note n="2" noteref="239">Tophet, valley near Jerusalem, where children were sacrificed to pagan gods; see Jer. 7:31.</note>
 and the City of Dis<note n="3" noteref="240">The City of Dis is the sixth circle of hell in Dante&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi>.</note>
 than any I have tried lately. Tophet now reaches strictly to the boundary lodge of Lady A., and has much spoiled Addiscombe Farm for a tenant of my humour.<note n="4" noteref="241">The streets of the new developments in the Addiscombe area later included Annandale St., Carlyle St., and Cheyne Walk.</note>
 &#x02018;Niagara,&#x02019; I heard yesterday, is in its fourth thousand, stirring up many a dull head one hopes, and &#x02018;sweeping off the froth from the Progress Pot,&#x02019; as one correspondent phrased it.</p>

<sourceNote>TC-FA [FAL], [<date when="1867-10-15">15 Oct.</date>]. Letter untraced. TC invited Friedrich Althaus (<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>&#x02013;<date when="1897-00-00">97</date>), German writer and historian, to call <date when="1867-10-16">16 Oct.</date> Wilson noted that Althaus &#x0201C;called by appointment between half-past two and three o&#x02019;clock on Wednesday, October 16&#x0201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 6:142&#x02013;43). Althaus had been asked by Rosetta Frankau, with TC&#x02019;s agreement, to finish Neuberg&#x02019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670411-TC-RFR-01"><sic>44:188</sic><corr>TC to RFR, [<date when="1867-04-11">11 April 1867</date>]</corr></ref>. Although he had written a biographical article on TC, this was their first actual meeting, and Althaus wrote later that TC was different from what he had expected: &#x0201C;His words, spoken quickly and in an undertone as if to himself, flowed on in an uninterrupted stream and allowed me only to half-comprehend many other remarks. &#x02026; His appearance &#x02026; corresponded only in part to the image I had formed. &#x02026; He appeared to me tall but not haggard, and his slightly bowed bearing did not accord with my idea of the gruff acerbity of his character. I had imagined the head more massive, the brow &#x02026; not so covered with thick gray hair, the face not so emaciated by his bushy, still half-gray beard. His eagle nose also surprised me, and in the glance of his blue-gray eyes I was struck more by a lightning quickness and penetration than by a deep resigned melancholy. &#x02026; In his long black coat hanging below his knees, his broad folded linen collar set over his old-fashioned high stiff black necktie, and his gaiters, his appearance reminded me of a German professor&#x0201D; (F.

<p>Candidly speaking, I do not think this Paper, in its pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> shape (the shape I heard it in), c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do much good either to the public or y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self.<note n="1" noteref="259">See <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670922-TC-CAW-01">TC to CAW, <date when="1867-09-22">22 Sept.</date></ref></note>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Several weeks ago there arrived from you a pleasant and very kind Letter, testifying in various ways that you held me in good remembrance,&#x02014;and announcing, especially, that a Colonial Gift from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> hand was on the road for me. Last week, after some little delay, due to cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> British Railway people, the munificent Sydney Box was accurately handed in here; &#x0201C;completely safe and correct in every partic<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x0201D; (as I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> now inform the punctual and obliging Mr Buchanan),<note n="1" noteref="272">See <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671018-TC-DBU-01">TC to DBU, <date when="1867-10-18">18 Oct.</date></ref></note>
 &#x0201C;and <hi rend="italic">franco</hi> [free of charge] from the Antipodes to this door!&#x0201D; So that all this is now a thing successful, faithfully achieved;&#x02014;and I am now in possess<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of my beautiful &#x0201C;&#x02019;Possum rug&#x0201D;; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I not a little admire, both as a specimen of Useful Peltry (probably enough &#x0201C;one of the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> rugs&#x0201D; ever made),<note n="2" noteref="273">TC noted, <date when="1867-10-01">1 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;One Parkes (Official in Sydney N.S.W.) announces 3 nights ago an &#x0201C;Opossum rug&#x0201D; approaching for me:&#x02014;Give it to Tyndall, to whom I am really in <hi rend="italic">Money</hi> debt (since Mentone, last year), and who will not look at money&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned). John Tyndall escorted TC to Menton, <date when="1866-12-00">Dec. 1866</date>; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18661224-TC-JCA-01"><sic>44:112&#x02013;14</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1866-12-24">24 Dec. 1866</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670121-TC-SWA-01"><sic>122</sic><corr>TC to SWA, <date when="1867-01-21">21 Jan. 1867</date></corr></ref>. John A.

 <pb id="pg-45-54" n="45:54"/>and on other still more human considerat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>: for all wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> kind benefits, and for the <hi rend="italic">warmth</hi> they are all suited to yield me in their various ways, please to accept my grateful acknowledg<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> and the best human thanks I have. You owed me nothing for 1862;<note n="3" noteref="274">Parkes visited the Carlyles several times when he was in Britain <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>&#x02013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>; see vol. 38 and Parkes, <hi rend="italic">Fifty Years</hi> 1:159&#x02013;67.</note>
 it is rather I that owe you. There are traits and words ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> those innocent ev<hi rend="italic">gs</hi> you spent with us, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I shall never forget,&#x02014;y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> face is still pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me as if I saw it; and, beautiful wise things said of you by One whom I shall now behold no more!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Of the Books &#x26;c I made a cursory examinat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and have them lying within reach when time allows of more. I had heard, long since, of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Official posit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>:<note n="4" noteref="275">He was colonial sec., <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868-00-00">68</date>, under James Martin (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x02013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>), premier of New South Wales <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>&#x02013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>, <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868-00-00">68</date>, and <date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872-00-00">72.</date></note>
 wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, I can now flatter myself, is of more stability than usual, and likely, on that and other grounds, to be of far more <hi rend="italic">utility</hi> perhaps! Everybody seems to believe that what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> lies in you of real Service to the Colony and its best interests will be strenuously <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. That is all that can be required of a man; and that is required of every man, in Office or not in,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; so very few even try to perform it!</p>
<p>By the Newsp<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> that came with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter, I see what babble and bother (ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Irish Priests, and other <hi rend="italic">inane</hi> objects)<note n="5" noteref="276">As President of the Council of Education, Parkes introduced the Public Schools Act, <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>. &#x0201C;The Bill provided for the establishment of Public Schools of a non-sectarian character, and for the continuation of support to Denominational schools on certain clearly prescribed conditions, one of which was that they should receive the same class of trained teachers, the same lesson books, and be subject to the same inspection and discipline as the public schools. &#x02026; One golden provision of the Bill was that no person, man or woman, should be allowed to enter any school as a teacher who had not been trained for the work of teaching. &#x02026; / The introduction of the Bill was the signal for an ecclesiastical storm. I was made the central object of attack, and no limits were set by my reverend and very reverend assailants to their inventive skill in personal abuse&#x0201D; (Parkes, <hi rend="italic">Fifty Years</hi> 1:197&#x02013;98). The Catholic clergy were particularly zealous in their opposition.</note>
 an Official man is exposed to;&#x02014;like a rider on express, by village dogs barking: but he ought to ride on, as nearly as possible &#x0201C;all the same,&#x0201D; with the due flourish of his whip, &#x26; (if it must be so) with the due passing salutat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> or lifting of the hat to said village dog; and if possible <hi rend="italic">arrive</hi> before &#x0201C;the Night&#x0201D; do! &#x02014; &#x02014;</p>
<p>I have been greatly shocked and surprised to hear that there is now,&#x02014;owing to abuses of the <hi rend="italic">Land-Law</hi>, and to internal intriguings,&#x02014;next to no Immigrat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> huge Colonial Contin<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of late;&#x02014;and that y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> majority by <pb id="pg-45-55" n="45:55"/>count of heads don&#x02019;t want any!<note n="6" noteref="277">Many colonists feared that increased immigration would depress the labor market; Parkes however had always supported immigration: &#x0201C;In my judgment &#x02026; the unreasoning opposition of a portion of the working classes to all immigration is little short of a craze. My argument has always been, and is still, that if there were four times the people in the country, the men and women of the right stamp, sober, industrious, and self-helping, every one of the present population would be better off from the economic effects produced by the larger numbers&#x0201D; (Parkes, <hi rend="italic">Fifty Years</hi> 1:121).</note>

 for seeing, &#x26; who had just returned from a long stay in the Country.

<p>I am glad to have an express word from you ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and to know where y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> actual address is,<note n="1" noteref="328">TC was unsure of Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s postal address at Melchet; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671025-TC-LLA-01">TC to Lady A [LLA], <date when="1867-10-25">25 Oct.</date></ref></note>
&#x02014;tho&#x02019; the news you send is bad enough!

 as I am now grown) considerable sections of this very Winter peaceably beside you there. The whole of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> appears to be now turned topsy-turvy, and gone to the waste winds ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>!</p>
<p>At all events, Melchet, or any other Great House, is for the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> become impossible for me,&#x02014;such my state of health, were there nothing <hi rend="italic">more</hi>; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> there <hi rend="italic">is</hi>. For, as it chances farther, my youngest Brother, an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> rustic man, with whom I have bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> too, has been appointed to come hither to me from <pb id="pg-45-65" n="45:65"/>Birmingham where he now is on visit; and till he have seen London and me (i.e. till perhaps towards the end of the month)<note n="3" noteref="330">James Carlyle left for Birmingham, <date when="1867-11-05">5 Nov.</date>, to visit his da., Jenny, and family; John A.

 I can undertake nothing. So that it seems likely I shall not see Melchet this year either; and must resign myself to that and other things. <hi rend="italic">Seaton</hi> I had rather <hi rend="italic">not</hi> see ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, you can guess for what reasons; Seaton, full of reminis<supplied>[cen]</supplied>ces now sad as Death can make them to me, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be too doleful!<note n="4" noteref="331">Seaforth Lodge, Seaton, Devonshire, where TC and JWC visited, <date when="1865-03-00">March 1865</date>; see vol. 41.

<salute>Dear Lord Brownlow.</salute>
<p>Here is a Photograph of Lukas Kranachs <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi>,<note n="1" noteref="338">Presumably a photograph taken by Robert Tait of the copy of Cranach&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Luther</hi> given to TC by Sir John Murray Naesmyth; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670905-TC-JMN-01">TC to Sir JMN [JMN], <date when="1867-09-05">5 Sept.</date></ref>; see also <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671123-TC-AW-01">TC to AW, <date when="1867-11-23">23 Nov.</date></ref></note>
 wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you can compare with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Italian Portrait. This I suppose to be probably the truest Likeness extant; and, sure enough, few things can be more unbeautiful: One of the coarsest faces, and yet of the most inspired and impressive, ever owned by man! He is pointing out Texts in his German Bible, and will take no excuse or denial.</p>
<p>Please give the inclosed bit of Paper to Lady Marian;<note n="2" noteref="339">Another copy of <hi rend="italic">Shooting Niagara: and After?</hi>, replacing the original copy lent to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671031-TC-LAL-01">TC to Lady Al [LAL], <date when="1867-10-31">31 Oct.</date></ref></note>
 Ladyship need not <hi rend="italic">read</hi> unless she like. I look back with pleasure and gratitude on my Lincolnshire Excursion; and hope to see you all again, by this good chance of King Theodore,<note n="3" noteref="340">Lord Brownlow and his mother were coming to London for the opening of parliament, <date when="1867-11-19">19 Nov.</date>, to deal with the situation in Abyssinia (northern half of Ethiopia).

<p><salute>Dear Sir,&#x02014;</salute>I am sorry and surprised to find in this batch of sheets<note n="1" noteref="347">For TC&#x02019;s references to Charles Robson &#x0201C;stereotyping the first sheets of <hi rend="italic">Fried</hi>h&#x0201D; and his request for the sheets to be sent as they were ready, see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671031-TC-FC-01">TC to FC, <date when="1867-10-31">31 Oct.</date></ref> The proofs were for the seven-vol. edn. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> being added to the uniform (cheap) edn. of TC&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>.</note>
 a sad falling off!

<p>Cold Winter is evidently at hand; but I am glad to believe that both of you, Elizabeth in partic<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, are <hi rend="italic">above</hi>, not below, y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> average state of preparat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for the bad Season.

Only don&#x02019;t go to excess in it either; excess even in a good thing is always bad.</p>
<p>My health is not fairly worse than the average, tho&#x02019; it is sometimes miserable enough. My Brother Jamie (youngest of my Brothers, and most like my Father in his ways; an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Old-Annandale specimen of sense and honesty!) came to me yesterday for a few days;<note n="3" noteref="357">TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1867-11-23">23 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Met</hi> Jamie yesterday in his cab, at the corner of Oakley Street,&#x02014;I running out for a half-hour&#x02019;s walk to be ready for him, he already come!

Rather below <hi rend="italic">par</hi> today. Unhappy mortal: peace!&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).</note>
 I expect my Sister Jean from Dumfries by and by (Mrs Aitken whom you have seen), who offers to come so far, &#x26; keep me company thro&#x02019; half-a-dozen of the dark weeks ahead. Winter, if only the cold be moderate, is not so unfriendly to me as it looks; I often suffer far more from the Summer &#x26; its sultry heats.</p>

<p>You are very good to me. Unluckily I have no <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi>. to copy,<note n="1" noteref="360">Emilie Venturi apparently had offered to copy for TC; she worked as a copyist and translator on many of Mazzini&#x02019;s manuscripts; see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18661213-TC-EV-01"><sic>44:108</sic><corr>TC to EV, <date when="1866-12-13">13 Dec. 1866</date></corr></ref>.

Thursday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 8&#xbd; p.m., if you can venture down, you will see me, and Tea getting ready,&#x02014;a Sister, who has just arrived <pb id="pg-45-77" n="45:77"/>from Dumfries, presiding over that operat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, <hi rend="italic">sola cum solo</hi> [she alone with me alone] as usual.</p>
<p>I believe I already know &#x0201C;the curious thing&#x0201D; you are going to tell me;<note n="2" noteref="392">David Masson wrote to TC, <date when="1867-11-16">16 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;About a fortnight ago Sir William Stirling-Maxwell [(<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x02013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26537"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 9th bart., art historian, book collector, and politician] &#x02026; told me something which he evidently wanted me to repeat to you. / The Historiographership-Royal of Scotland (little more than an honorary post) was vacant some time ago; and the Lord-Advocate [Edward Strathearn Gordon (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11031"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), judge and politician] was particularly anxious that you should have the refusal of it, &#x26; that the &#x02026; government should have the credit of having at least offered it to you. He had made up his mind to this five months ago perhaps; but the appointment was delayed for some reason of etiquette. When the time for it did come on, the Lord-Advocate, not having much power in these matters, as Lords-Advocate used to have, did his part to the utmost by sending in to the Home-Secretary [Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x02013;<date when="1906-00-00">1906</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33356"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), politician] a list of three names in the order in which he wished them to be considered. Yours was first in the list; then Mr Hill Burton&#x02019;s; then Mr W. F. Skene&#x02019;s [(<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x02013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4135"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), historian and Celtic scholar]. This list was lying in the Home-Office, &#x26; no decision had been come to by Mr Hardy, but only one decision was expected, when&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x0201C;Niagara&#x0201D; came out in <hi rend="italic">Macmillan</hi>. After that it was felt that the proposed offer to you could hardly be made with comfort on either side; Mr Gordon had reluctantly to acquiesce; and Mr Hill Burton was appointed. / As I said, this may be no news to you; and, in any case, it will be no care to you. But as Sir William Stirling-Maxwell clearly wished that you should be made aware of the circumstances, and as the one really interesting item in the affair is the creditable attention of the Lord-Advocate (whom I do not know personally, but shall think well of for this one fact)&#x02014;I trouble you with the communication.&#x0201D; TC wrote on the letter when sending it on to John A. Carlyle: &#x0201C;rather curious!&#x02014;return&#x0201D;; John replied, <date when="1867-11-24">24 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;I enclose Masson&#x02019;s &#x02026; letter. &#x02026; In <date when="1867-09-00">September</date> Mr Douglas of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> told me &#x02026; that he had met Hill Burton at dinner on the day of his appointment as Historiographer, &#x26; Burton told the whole company present that you ought before all others to have been chosen for the office.&#x0201D; For Mr. Douglas, see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670921-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1867-09-21">21 Sept.</date></ref></note>

<p>Here is a new year come upon us (and an old one gone away never to return):&#x02014;I cannot better begin my <hi rend="italic">datings</hi> by the new style than (as I am now doing, in great haste) than by this little Note to a Sister who always loves me,&#x02014;enclosing the poor little Paper here,<note n="1" noteref="402">TC recorded: &#x0201C;2 jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> (<date when="1868-01-01">1 jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date> rather) <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date> / To Sister Mary / &#x000A3;10 .. 0 .. 0&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).

 in testimony of the love I always return for hers. If good wishes w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> avail, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have a right &#x0201C;happy new year,&#x0201D; and many of them! But the <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> is good for nothing, except perhaps to him that entertains it.</p>
<p>I am in my old state of <hi rend="italic">health</hi>, neither worse nor better; and am struggling on, rather drearily for most part, &#x26; with <hi rend="italic">other</hi> than a joyful heart (as you will well believe), the best I can.

 The cold frosty weather frets me in some respects,&#x02014;especially in that of cracking the skin of my hands:&#x02014;I have often tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of you with regard to that; and I did provide myself with a <hi rend="italic">six-penny bit of black Court-plaster</hi><note n="3" noteref="404">Sticking-plaster made of silk coated with isinglass, used for covering superficial cuts and wounds.

 (the only real remedy), intended for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> behoof:&#x02014;but, by ill luck, I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> at this moment lay my hands on it at all; and am much <pb id="pg-45-80" n="45:80"/>chased for time!&#x02014; &#x02014; In a day or two, you shall certainly have it, with direct<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> how to apply it.<note n="4" noteref="405">Mary Austin replied, <date when="1868-01-07">7 Jan.</date>, thanking TC for his kindness &#x0201C;which has been unwearied to me I may say since ever I mind. &#x02026; I have laid the plaister paste as you directed It will be very useful my hands are not nearly so bad for cracking as they used to be cracks on any place are often very painful.&#x0201D;</note>

 to have run over, this day, to Scotsbrig, in hon<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of the New Year; and to be there probably just now (1&#xbd; p.m.), or walking thither, by a well known road, in the frosty bracing air. A right kindly and pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> journey to you, tho&#x02019; I can&#x02019;t be of it!

May the Year, if not worth calling &#x0201C;happy,&#x0201D; be at least not quite useless and unworthy; let us all strive for ourselves to make it that!&#x02014;</p>

Sure enough it were well to do out <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> in the style of vol I; but it is not a task worth losing one&#x02019;s health for, or loading one&#x02019;s final years with a burden they cannot bear.<note n="4" noteref="412">John A.

One&#x02019;s ideals get stricter, &#x26; one&#x02019;s capacity for realizing them smaller, as one grows older&#x0201D; (MS: Hornel).</note>

E<hi rend="small-caps">rskine</hi>,&#x02014;</salute>The sight of your handwriting is itself welcome and cheering to me at all times. And I owe you many thanks this time for that pious <pb id="pg-45-86" n="45:86"/>little visit you have made to Greenend and poor Betty.<note n="1" noteref="444">Betty Braid; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670714-TC-BB-01">TC to BB, <date when="1867-07-14">14 July 1867</date></ref>. Either TC or Erskine misdated their letter; Erskine wrote, <date when="1868-01-24">24 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;You are not an unusual subject of thought to me, but you were lately more particularly brought before me, by a visit which I paid to your friend Mrs Braid. She, honest woman, likes to have a visit from me as it gives her the opportunity of dilating on the subject which of all earthly things is most interesting to her.&#x0201D; Erskine often visited Betty; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18651027-JWC-BB-01"><sic>43:22</sic><corr>JWC to BB, <date when="1865-10-27">27 Oct.

 Often had I thought of asking you to do such a thing for me by some opportunity, but, in the new sad circumstances,<note n="2" noteref="445">The deaths of JWC and of Erskine&#x02019;s sisters, <date when="1866-04-00">April 1866</date>&#x02013;<date when="1867-03-00">March 1867</date>.</note>
 never had the face. Now that the ice is broken, let me hope you will from time to time continue, and on the whole, keep yourself and me in some kind of mutual visibility with poor Betty, so long as we are all spared to continue here. The world has not many shrines to a devout man at present, and perhaps in our own section of it there are few objects holding more authentically of Heaven and an unseen &#x0201C;better world&#x0201D; than the pious loving soul and patient heavy-laden life of this poor old venerable woman. The love of human creatures one to another, where it is true and unchangeable, often strikes me as a strange fact in their poor history, a kind of perpetual Gospel, revealing itself in them; sad, solemn, beautiful, the heart and mother of all that can, in any way, ennoble their otherwise mean and contemptible existence in this world.</p>
<p>I am very idle here, very solitary, which I find to be oftenest less miserable to me than the common society that offers. Excepting Froude almost alone, whom I see once a week, there is hardly anybody whose talk, always polite, clear, sharp, and sincere, does me any considerable good. He has an excellent article in the last <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02019;s Magazine</hi>, on &#x0201C;Protestantism,&#x0201D;<note n="3" noteref="446">J. A. Froude, &#x0201C;Conditions and Prospects of Protestantism,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02019;s Magazine</hi> (<date when="1868-01-00">Jan. 1868</date>) 56&#x02013;70.</note>
 which I think you, if you have not already read it, would read with sympathy.</p>
<p>It is a great evil to me that now I have no work, none worth calling by the name; that I am too weak, too languid, too sad of heart, to be fit for any work, in fact to care sufficiently for any object left me in the world, to think of grappling round it and coercing it by work. A most sorry dog-kennel it oftenest all seems to me, and wise words, if one even had them, to be only thrown away on it. Basta&#x02014;basta [Enough, enough], I for most part say of it, and look with longings towards the still country where at last we and our loved ones shall be together again. Amen, amen.</p>
<p>A sister of mine is with me here for these two months, to help us through the dark hollow of the year; it is the one you saw in Edinburgh,<note n="4" noteref="447">Meeting of Erskine and Jean Aitken untraced.</note>
 as she right well remembers, I can see. Lady Ashburton is again in Mentone with her child. Adieu, dear friend.&#x02014; <salute>Yours ever,</salute></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Before y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter came I had heard of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Candidatecy,<note n="1" noteref="449">Stirling was a candidate for the chair of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh Univ.; he wrote, <date when="1868-01-12">12 Jan.</date>, asking for TC&#x02019;s support.</note>
 and have been frequently thinking of it since. So far as I understand, it was expected of you, and considered likely to be successful by the Public.</p>
<p>I have myself little right to speak on such a subject: quite an alien from all such a subject: quite an alien from all Metaphysic for the last forty years, and ignorant at present what the Electors specially intend their Moral-Philosophy Professor to accomplish for them. n.b. (To what I already ventured to say on a similar occas<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I can now add, after reading some of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> recent product<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> and translations,<note n="2" noteref="450">See<ref target="volume-45/lt-18671008-TC-JHS-01">TC to JHS, <date when="1867-10-08">8 Oct.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671020-TC-JHS-01"><date when="1867-10-20">20 Oct. 1867</date></ref>.</note>
 That in regard to German Metaphysics I do find you to have yourself understood every word you put down, and to be completely intelligible to a reader that will take suffic<hi rend="italic">t</hi> pains;&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> so far as my experience reaches, is more than can be said of any Brit<hi rend="italic">h</hi> man that has gone before you on those topics.)</p>
<p>I did not write to Masson or Blackie; not knowing the least thing of Prof<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Shairp,&#x02014;nor indeed believing that they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> in fact make any such foregone conclusion &#x26; combinat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as you had heard of in regard to him or anybody.<note n="3" noteref="451">Stirling wrote: &#x0201C;The only other candidate of any weight at this moment is Professor Shairp of St. Andrews. &#x02026; It is attempted &#x02026; to bring about a coalition of the Arts Professors [in support of Shairp] which &#x02026; would be very powerful. &#x02026; I take this coalition ill, for three of these Professors, Fraser, Masson, &#x26; Blackie seemed among my warmest supporters on the last occasion. &#x02026; There are signs, however, of the coalition already breaking up, &#x26; it seems to me that a word from you in my favour to Masson &#x26; Blackie would fairly consummate this.&#x0201D; John Campbell Shairp (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x02013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25196"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), prof. of Latin at St. Andrews Univ.; Alexander Campbell Fraser (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x02013;<date when="1914-00-00">1914</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33247"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), prof. of Logic and Metaphysics, David Masson, prof. of Rhetoric and English Literature, and John Stuart Blackie (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x02013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2524"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), prof. of Greek, all at Edinburgh Univ.; TC was friendly with both Masson and Blackie (see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18651120-TC-JAC-01"><sic>43:42</sic><corr>TC to JAC, [<date when="1865-11-20">20 Nov. 1865</date>]</corr></ref>). TC presumably did write to Masson, as he replied, <date when="1868-02-4">4 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;I have heard of no such combination for Shairp as Stirling speaks of, and do not think it likely there could be such a combination [TC inserted above the line: &#x0201C;anywhere;&#x02014;I did n&#x02019;t <hi rend="italic">say</hi> among &#x02018;Professors&#x02019;)&#x0201D;], at least yet, among seven men so diverse.&#x0201D;</note>
 Indeed with all my goodwill I can see no <hi rend="italic">perfectly clear</hi> way of helping you,&#x02014;except that you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, if you like, print, in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Book of Testimonials, what I have here marked the margin of,<note n="4" noteref="452">TC bracketed the passage above from &#x0201C;To what I already ventured to say&#x0201D; to &#x0201C;on those topics.&#x0201D;</note>
 in the form of <hi rend="italic">sequel</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow</hi> thing I wrote <pb id="pg-45-88" n="45:88"/>for you 2 years ago.<note n="5" noteref="453">Stirling applied for the chair of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow Univ., <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>, and TC wrote a testimonial for him at the time; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660418-TC-JHS-01"><sic>43:204</sic><corr>TC to JHS, <date when="1866-04-18">18 April 1866</date></corr></ref>.

 If that can be of any avail, that is a fact, and can stand fronting all the winds.

<salute>Dear Tyndall,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your manifold attentions to me! My misfortunes began last Friday at 5 a.m., when <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> fled prematurely, and they did not end till 8&#xbd; p.m&#x02014;when the fruit of my hard struggles thro&#x02019; the day went suddenly to air. My sister had surrendered, but for my own share, I was positive and had driven all things and arrangements vigorously on; determined on Albermarle Street<note n="1" noteref="456">The Royal Institution is at 21 Albemarle St., London. TC had hoped to attend Tyndall&#x02019;s first discourse on Michael Faraday; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680115-TC-JTY-01">TC to JTY, <date when="1868-01-15">15 Jan.</date></ref></note>

 could detain me at the last moment, but got dismissed after a tepid cup of coffee (vice tea);&#x02014;when, stepping triumphantly down, I discovered that it was raining torrents, the half-hour fairly come or more and nobody to run for a conveyance except a poor woman in her cottons. Pity me if you like. I am not very fortunate! At all events, don&#x02019;t bother <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> more with me in thick of many other cares and agitations.</p>
<p>My sister gives it up for good: I not at all, but am bent for this Friday,<note n="3" noteref="458">TC was writing on Thurs.

And in calling today I expressly mentioned this &#x02026; that you were to confine yourselves to the &#x000A3;200 &#x26; get only what lime it would buy. &#x02026; I think it will be much better both for your uncle &#x26; you to continue the old plan he has been accustomed to for nearly fifty years, &#x26; Adamson as a man of business or his partner Symons will easily understand any sort of farm accounts you give in&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kindness to Richards on his arrival;<note n="1" noteref="498">Arthur Henry Richards (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x02013;<date when="1898-00-00">98</date>), son of John Richards (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x02013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), M.P. for Knaresborough, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x02013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>. He wrote, <date when="1867-06-07">7 June 1867</date>, asking TC&#x02019;s advice on making his way in the world; he had been unable to complete his university studies due to extreme poverty and was unable to find any work for which he was temperamentally suited. TC wrote on the envelope: &#x0201C;&#x02018;hour&#x02019;s advice&#x02019;? <date when="1867-06-00">june 1867</date>&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1768.252); he saw him, Tues. <date when="1867-06-11">11 June 1867</date>, and Richards wrote again, <date when="1867-06-15">15 June 1867</date>: &#x0201C;As I returned to Town in the steamboat on Tuesday afternoon, many serious considerations w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> your remarks were calculated to awaken, occurred to my mind. The decision I came to, after much turbulence of spirit, was to take your counsel with a certain restriction for my mother&#x02019;s sake. For it seemed to me that if I strove once more for occupation in England and failed, I should, at least, have done what I could to help myself and please her. For this reason, I will take two months for an employment struggle, and in the event of failure, I will, provided I can raise sufficient passage money, start immediately for Melbourne&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1768.259). His mother may have been Mary, b. Pauncefort (b. <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>). Richards then wrote, <date when="1867-07-15">15 July 1867</date>, that he had decided to go to Melbourne. Unable to raise enough for a second class passage, he intended to travel steerage: &#x0201C;You have taught me that degradation is not incurred from the position, but by the man; and, therefore, although I shall have to associate with the lowest characters, I shall, if not cheerfully, at least without sorrow submit myself to their companionship. / I have obtained as many References as I could, and with yours upon which, in a great measure I depend, coupled with my own resolution, I hope to succeed.&#x0201D; He planned his departure for about <date when="1867-08-20">20 Aug. 1867</date>. The Duffys lived in Melbourne.</note>
 it is a full honouring of the bill I drew on you in that respect: and whatever more ensues shall rest with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self only, and y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own discern<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the facts, not mine any farther. That was a very awkward provoking blunder, doubtless, that ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Newspaper;&#x02014;but I ought to tell you withal that I believe it proceeded altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> from ignorance and <hi rend="italic">irresolut</hi>n in the matter; and that &#x0201C;pride&#x0201D; had no share in it at any stage.<note n="2" noteref="499">Duffy wrote, <date when="1867-12-27">[27] Dec. 1867</date>: &#x0201C;It was a great pleasure to me to get your note by Mr Richards. You will see by the accompanying note from him that he has found an engagement which will enable him to look about him and understand the country&#x02014;the first condition necessary to prospering in it. He has not made quite so formidable an impression on me as he did on you. He is deficient in good sense I think&#x02014; For example I obtained for him a promise of employment from the principal newspaper here; and bade him <hi rend="italic">send me</hi> an article on any subject he thought proper. He declined to try journalism as below his ambition; and then, in a few days, wrote to the Editor on the subject, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> through me. &#x02026; I mention this because it showed such a want of proper consideration for the friend who was aiding him that I think you must be prepared for this deficiency in his character. I did not complain at all, as I do not think there was any wilful wrong done, nor did it interfere with my efforts to be useful to him.&#x0201D; TC wrote on Duffy&#x02019;s envelope: &#x0201C;Duffy, <date when="1867-10-00">Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1867</date>: ab<hi rend="italic">t Richards</hi> (never <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> from that individ<hi rend="italic">l</hi> yet,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">n&#x02019;importe</hi>:&#x02014;(find this <date when="1870-04-13">13 april 1870</date>).&#x0201D; Duffy prefaced the letter: &#x0201C;The pains Carlyle took to recommend for employment young men whom he was never likely to see in the world again reveals the true nature of the man, generous, considerate, and sympathetic&#x0201D; (Duffy 231&#x02013;32).</note>
 The poor fellow, at our first meeting, cautiously told me he was busy, <pb id="pg-45-98" n="45:98"/>night &#x26; day, writing &#x0201C;a Novel,&#x0201D; and had the better half of it done,&#x02014;lodging the while with some charitable comrade;<note n="3" noteref="500">Richards&#x02019;s address in London was 5 Mitre Court, Temple, presumably the lodgings of a lawyer friend.</note>

You may guess what approval this project met with from me: &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Better</hi> die,&#x0201D; I said, with denunciat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of &#x0201C;Literature&#x0201D; so called, especially of <hi rend="italic">Newsp</hi>r work and its roaring blackguardisms (as here in London),&#x02014;the &#x0201C;wages&#x0201D; of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, how<hi rend="italic">r</hi> high, I pronounced to be Bedlam &#x26; Gehenna,<note n="4" noteref="501">Bedlam and Gehenna is TC&#x02019;s phrase in &#x0201C;Shooting Niagara&#x0201D; for the worst of places; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:4; Gehenna is the valley of Hinnom, nr. Jerusalem, where some of the Israelites sacrificed their children to Moloch; see Jer. 7:31.</note>

 At our second meeting after some weeks of considerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, Richards gratified me much by report that he had now (&#x0201C;last night,&#x0201D; if I remember) <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> out of the world his &#x0201C;Novel&#x0201D; &#x26; all that held of it;<note n="6" noteref="503">Richards wrote, <date when="1867-06-15">15 June 1867</date>: &#x0201C;There is another thing in which I have taken your counsel; but I cannot deny that it has not occasioned me much sorrow. This morning I cast my Novel into the fire, and watched the concentrated thought of three years speedily consume. I don&#x02019;t suppose it was valuable, but I had spent so much labor on it that the work had assumed a greatness in my eyes which was scarcely warranted&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1768.259).</note>
 and was wholly resolute now for a life of silent <hi rend="italic">working</hi>, as the real course for him. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> will have been, this and not &#x0201C;pride,&#x0201D; his reason for rejecting y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind offer in that depart<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; then, soon after, he will have repented (&#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">w</hi>d have helped for the moment, tho&#x02019;!&#x0201D;),&#x02014;been ashamed to trouble <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on it, tried to help himself by the <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> course; and so have gone into the quagmire, on ground <hi rend="italic">he</hi> knew nothing of! Let him have the benefit of this hypothesis, if you can, as I think: and that is all I will say or expect on the matter.</p>
<p>You say nothing of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self or of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> big Australian World; on both wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> points, especially the former, you might have expected a willing listener surely!

In his conclusion Mill warned, &#x0201C;Let our statesmen be assured that now, when the long deferred day of Fenianism has come, nothing which is not accepted by the Irish tenantry as a permanent solution of the land difficulty, will prevent Fenianism, or something equivalent to it, from being the standing torment of the English Government and people.

Faults of <hi rend="italic">com</hi>mission, I know well enough, at the same time, there are none! as there never were.

<salute>Dear Helps,</salute>
<p>Practically I know almost nothing of Friend Knyghton.<note n="1" noteref="536">William Knighton; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670923-TC-WK-01">TC to WK, <date when="1867-09-23">23 Sept. 1867</date></ref>.</note>
 Ten or 12 years ago he was a Schoolmaster, in orthodox circ<hi rend="italic">s</hi> in this neighb<hi rend="italic">d</hi>; and came down 4 or 5 times to volunteer a bit of dialogue with me, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I struggled (unsuccessfully) not to be bored with,&#x02014;poor good Knighton! He always seemed to me an honest, placid, well intentioned soul, intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> enough too, what is called intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, to whom I really wished well, but only <hi rend="italic">at a distance</hi> (had it pleased Heaven and him,&#x02014;as it soon happily did!) Since his <hi rend="italic">last</hi> &#x0201C;return from India&#x0201D; I have hardly seen him; and wish in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> I hadn&#x02019;t heard either.</p>
<p>His Literatures, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have read a specimen or two,<note n="2" noteref="537">Knighton pbd. articles in various magazines.</note>
 are of free-flowing, vivacious, orthodoxly <hi rend="italic">jolly</hi> nature; but always too of loose and flabby. By no means wanting in a kind of <hi rend="italic">talent</hi> for the utterly idle reader; and shewing traces even of a moral vein. Nothing of malign or ill-natured, nothing of <hi rend="italic">false</hi> did I ever discern in them or in him, but also nothing of rigidly accurate; a free and easy kind of good eupeptic man.</p>
<p>He has lived twice in India; and must have some mode of speaking intelligibly to the Natives. But of his powers or likelihoods for good Hindoo <hi rend="italic">Translat</hi>n <hi rend="italic">out of English</hi> I can really form no safe guess.<note n="3" noteref="538">Arthur Helps wrote, <date when="1868-03-05">5 March</date>, asking for TC&#x02019;s opinion of Knighton&#x02019;s &#x0201C;literary ability&#x02014;especially as to the likelihood of his being a man who could translate English into Hindostani well?&#x0201D; Helps also wrote to Froude, who replied more positively: &#x0201C;Mr Knighton has written some papers in Fraser called Village Sketches in Oude above the average merit. He is in the Indian Civil service and I think was raised into it from some lower position in consequence of showing special talents&#x02014;I cannot tell what he is up to in translation but I should expect fully to find capacity of that kind in a man of his position&#x0201D; (DeBruyn, &#x0201C;Thomas Carlyle and Sir Arthur Helps&#x0201D; 64:418&#x02013;19).

<p>I altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> feel with you that it will be much more suitable to have all those American odds and ends (Bonds, Coupons or what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> they are) reduced to a tight and square condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, &#x26; lodged with Brit<hi rend="italic">h</hi> L<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Co<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, ready at all times, and in spite of any accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, for such act<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as is in them.<note n="1" noteref="550">John A.

 I have accord<hi rend="italic">ly</hi> written to Butler (the inclosed) what I suppose is comform<hi rend="italic">ble</hi> to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> instruct<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, and will suffice to <hi rend="italic">launch</hi> you on that kind Enterprise,<note n="2" noteref="551">John A.

And so, with my Good-speed, enough of all that for the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.</p>
<p>I am truly sorry you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be so plagued with indigestions;&#x02014;it is the sorest, heaviest and basest of all the burdens one&#x02019;s poor back has to bear!&#x02014; Nothing is of use to me, except walking,&#x02014;and that not the least effectual always.

<salute>Dear Sister Jenny,</salute>
<p>Some six weeks ago (I think) or more, I sent you, carefully drawn out, a little Draught on the Canada Bank for &#x000A3;21. It was addressed to you in the <pb id="pg-45-108" n="45:108"/>usual way &#x0201C;Care of Mr R.

</p>
<p>It is not likely there can have any mistake happened ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this little matter; and probably I told you a &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Newspaper with strokes</hi>&#x0201D; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, at first be acknowedg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> enough. But as I have rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> nothing what<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, neither Newsp<hi rend="italic">r</hi> nor Letter, in the way of signal, I begin to be a little surprised;&#x02014;and will now ask you to write me the smallest <hi rend="italic">word</hi> of Yes or No on the subject, the instant this arrives. Do, and that will settle it.</p>
<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> friends &#x26; kindred, myself included, are all in their usual way of health&#x02014;John at Dumfries &#x26; I here are both complaining of <hi rend="italic">bad stomach</hi> &#x26;c, but that is nothing new with some of us, as you know well enough, nor means very much!&#x02014; Jean was here till last week; and is now at Birkenhead (Liverpool), helping her Son James &#x26; daughter Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, who are setting up house together, to finish their modest furnishings before she return home. Son James has got a favourable &#x26; promising place at last,&#x02014;not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> deserving it. Brother John (&#x0201C;the Dr&#x0201D;), I believe is just off on a little tour to Glasgow &#x26; Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, for health&#x02019;s sake; &#x26; may possibly take Chelsea on his return.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Stratford,</salute>
<p>You are very kind to me; and surely I am much obliged. But, alas, I am ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> unfortunate! After various hesitat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, I had at last consented to go with Lord Northbrook into &#x0201C;absolute country silence&#x0201D; (of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I seem to have need enough) &#x0201C;for 4 days&#x0201D;;&#x02014;and on that very &#x0201C;Saturday 18th,&#x0201D; I am bound to arrive at Stratton Park (Hants), and stay till Thursday,&#x02014;unless <hi rend="italic">want of sleep</hi> &#x26;c drive me home sooner.</p>
<p>This I consider very unlucky. Your place is nearer; nobody can be kinder than you to me.

Carlyle wrote, <date when="1868-04-12">12 April</date>: &#x0201C;I did go to Scotsbrig last week, staid one night there with Jamie &#x26; then drove over to the Gill with him.

 Well, well; if there is <hi rend="italic">really</hi> &#x0201C;no news,&#x0201D; that is good news!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I am engaged to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> this day week to Stratton Park as you see; return on Thursday, if I can hold out so long. Another Lordship (or Ladyship, as you see) invited me yesterday for the same day &#x0201C;18th,&#x0201D;&#x02014;that I might rather have preferred, as at least <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi>; but perhaps it is better, and <hi rend="italic">quieter</hi>, otherwise.<note n="2" noteref="603">TC wrote, <date when="1868-04-13">13 April</date>: &#x0201C;Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> next I am to go to Stratton (Lord Northbrook&#x02019;s, &#x02018;Tom Baring&#x02019;s&#x02019;), and &#x02018;see the Grange ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x02019; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is close by,&#x02014;return on Thursday following.

The Stratford de Redcliffes invited me since for the same <hi rend="italic">day</hi>, but excuse was easy. It strikes me now as with a shadow of <hi rend="italic">remorse</hi> that <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> will be <hi rend="italic">the 21</hi><hi rend="small-caps">st</hi> [the anniversary of JWC&#x02019;s death], and that I shall be far away from the <hi rend="italic">place in Hyde Park</hi> to whc<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have walked that day. &#x02026; The <hi rend="italic">place</hi> (which no stranger knows of) is already quite changed, Drinking fountain &#x26;c: I was there yesterday; but Froude was in company, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> only linger one little instant&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal, privately owned; Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:367).</note>

<p>Yesterday I walked up to Forster&#x02019;s; he is really in a very <hi rend="italic">coughing</hi>, struggling, heavy condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>: but won&#x02019;t give in, labours along.<note n="4" noteref="605">Forster wrote, <date when="1868-04-13">13 April</date>, asking TC to dinner on Thurs., <date when="1868-04-16">16 April</date>, instead of the planned Tues., <date when="1868-04-14">14 April</date>: &#x0201C;I have not stirred out of doors since you saw me.

 Both he &#x26; Mrs are much astonished ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Cunningh<hi rend="italic">m</hi>: it was they that began talking of it to me; Forster cannot doubt but his Letter to Frank <hi rend="italic">went</hi>;&#x02014;but he seems determined to overhaul (by some good method), and convince himself beyond doubt that Frank read it: after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed there can nothing more be done.<note n="5" noteref="606">Francis Cunningham; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670921-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1867-09-21">21 Sept. 1867</date></ref>.

<p>[TC wrote in his letter to John some kind of testimonial for Stirling, which John then copied out.<note n="1" noteref="611">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1868-04-14">14 April</date>: &#x0201C;Your letter came duly today, &#x26; I have already written to Dods, to Stirling.&#x0201D; He had written to J. H.

 He asked about the progress of the photographing <pb id="pg-45-117" n="45:117"/>of JWC&#x02019;s grave.<note n="2" noteref="612">John A. Carlyle wrote to William Dods, <date when="1868-04-14">14 April</date>, that he had just received a letter from TC inquiring whether he had heard from Dods about the proposed photograph of JWC&#x02019;s grave: &#x0201C;Of course, from the position of the Stone with its Inscriptions lying flat on the ground, some special apparatus for supporting the Artists&#x02019; Camera above it &#x02026; would be required; but any expense thereby incurred would be most willingly paid. / I should like also for myself to have the other two Cartes&#x02014;outside &#x26; if possible inside of the abbey where Grave is; but these are of less importance&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1797.142). Dods replied, <date when="1868-04-18">18 April</date>: &#x0201C;I have sent by this post the two photographs you wished to have done of the stone &#x26; part of the ruin within which it is placed.&#x0201D; He explained that the &#x0201C;stone is represented in a rather awkward position&#x0201D; because of the difficulty of taking a picture of a flat thing (MS: NLS 1763.294). John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1868-04-18">18 April</date>, thanking him; he thought the photographs very good and asked for a dozen copies of each. He then wrote to TC, <date when="1868-04-19">19 April</date>, enclosing the photographs: &#x0201C;Both Inscriptions are quite legible, as you will see, &#x26; we dont think any better photographs could be taken of the stone as it lies.&#x0201D; TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1868-04-27">27 April</date>: &#x0201C;On [Monday <date when="1868-04-20">20 April</date>] afternoon there had arrived a roll of card; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I knew well to be <hi rend="small-caps">two</hi> P<hi rend="small-caps">hotogrhs</hi> of the Tomb in Haddington Church (Br<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John had inconsiderately hurried them after me <hi rend="italic">thither</hi> [Stratton Park]); for 24 hours I shuddered to open them; then at last, late on Tuesday night [the anniversary of JWC&#x02019;s death], desperately broke in, and took one steady look. It was only here [Chelsea] that I first deliberately looked ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, assured myself that all was <hi rend="italic">legible</hi> &#x26;c; it was only <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> that I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> first look and ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> look with steady considerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and deposit the sad Pictures, nearby for further &#x02018;use&#x02019;;&#x02014;if it be not almost <hi rend="italic">misuse</hi>? No it isn&#x02019;t!&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned). The two photographs, one of the flat tombstone and the other of the tombstone in the unroofed choir of St. Mary&#x02019;s Church, are probably the two currently in Carlyle&#x02019;s House, which also has two other photographs of the choir, framed, with TC&#x02019;s inscription reproduced between them.</note>
 He asked if any of the family had a copy of the 3d edn. of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>.<note n="3" noteref="613">John A.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x02014;</salute>I must send you an articulate word, to <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> you that I am safe here, and that nothing is going wrong with me, but rather the contrary.</p>
<p>I had the quietest of journeys down, a huge carriage all to myself, a grey temperately windy day, and the sight of the Spring fields mournfully pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me: a very small gig, and one of the smartest of little horses and d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of drivers set me straightway down here,&#x02014;a big, big House with very few people in it; where my reception &#x26;c has been all that one can wish.</p>

The author was the jurist Sheldon Amos (<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x02013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/454"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>). His main argument was that &#x0201C;To rest the whole fabric of government upon manhood suffrage, before the quality of manhood, in the civic sense, had time to develop, could not be otherwise than a hazardous experiment. &#x02026; A British community, however, is not easily misgoverned. The errors, follies, and excesses which in a colony of any other race would have ended long before this in bloodshed and anarchy, have in Victoria only led to general corruption of the organs of political life&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> 89:492&#x02013;93). A large proportion of the population of Victoria were gold miners who were, he argued, by their very nature and work migratory, not settled, and not in families, and so did not have the welfare of the colony at heart. &#x0201C;One of the first results of manhood suffrage in Victoria was to divide the population into two hostile camps, corresponding &#x02026; to two social classes. &#x02026; The distinction between the majority and the minority is not a difference in opinion so much as in interest, in wealth, and in intelligence&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> 89:494). In such circumstances, Amos contended: &#x0201C;Politics are reduced to a trade, or rather, lower still, to a species of gambling. Gentlemen adventurers, who are too idle to work, even in a country where work so easily reaches its reward, devote themselves to the profession of politician. They are ready to back any opinion, and to uphold any principle&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> 89:498&#x02013;99).</note>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I meant to come up tonight; but was too stupid, low and weary: I wanted to ask how you were, and to tell you something ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Watts.<note n="1" noteref="642">George Frederic Watts, who began working on his portraits of TC <date when="1867-06-00">June 1867</date> (see <ref target="volume-44/lt-18670608-TC-GFW-01"><sic>44:209</sic><corr>TC to GFW, <date when="1867-06-08">8 June 1867</date></corr></ref>), had apparently become discouraged. But Forster wrote to TC, <date when="1868-05-11">11 May</date>: &#x0201C;I cannot help putting in a word &#x02026; for more than &#x02018;a head&#x02019; in the Watts portrait&#x0201D;; and TC noted in his journal, <date when="1868-05-24">24 May</date>: &#x0201C;One of the Preliminaries to &#x02018;vol I of Lib<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x02019; is a Portrait of Self (forsooth!) to go as frontispiece. Forster urged and ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> urged me, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take no denial: &#x02018;Sit to Watts; Picture for me!&#x02019;&#x0201D; TC continued, <date when="1868-05-25">25 May</date>: &#x0201C;I had at bottom a kind of &#x02026; feeble <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> that Watts, who has been aiming towards it for ten years past, <hi rend="italic">sh</hi>d finally paint me; &#x02018;many have done it, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the least success; why not this one try it, who is universally reputed the best?&#x02019; tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I, now and then. In short, he is at it;&#x02014;and I am to go ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> today &#x02026; for a &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">second sitting</hi>.&#x02019; It will cost Forster &#x000A3;150, poor Forster; but he has bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it on himself, and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take no denial!&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned). Forster had commissioned the portrait. The first of the renewed sittings was to take place Friday, <date when="1868-05-22">22 May</date> (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680520-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1868-05-20">20 May</date></ref>); it was supposedly completed early Nov. (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681031-TC-CPH-01">TC to CPH, <date when="1868-10-31">31 Oct.</date></ref>) but Watts continued trying to improve it during <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date> (see vol. 46). In the event, the frontis. of vol. 1 of the library edn., <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, was Joseph Brown&#x02019;s engraving of Elliott &#x26; Fry&#x02019;s April <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date> photograph of TC; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681017-TC-FC-01">TC to FC, [<date when="1-10-17">17 Oct.</date>]</ref> and 42:frontis.</note>

My cough much less at night. But I shrink from my impending journey, &#x26; the hotels discomforts!&#x0201D;</note>
&#x02014;and in regard to Watts take <hi rend="italic">this</hi> the mere needful. I went to Watts the day after you spoke; Watts is ready with the readiest, will &#x0201C;take a sitting&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">qu&#x000E0;m prim&#x000F9;m</hi> [as soon as possible]: only he wanted first to <hi rend="italic">see you</hi>, to settle ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the size,<note n="3" noteref="644">Watts painted three portraits of TC; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680530-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1868-05-30">30 May</date></ref>. The V &#x26; A portrait (the only one to include hands), commissioned by Forster, is 25&#xbd; in. (65 cm.) &#xd7; 20&#xbd; in. (52 cm.) (estimated measurements), the NPG portrait is 26 in. (66 cm.) &#xd7; 21 in. (53 cm.), and the unfinished portrait is 19 in. (48 cm.) &#xd7; 17&#xbd; in. (44 cm.).

 the &#x26;c; and I vaguely but confidently understood he was to <hi rend="italic">call</hi> for that purpose,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; indeed a bright Lady<note n="4" noteref="645">Unidentified further.</note>
 scared me off from him, and herself took possess<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, rather in a hurry. So that today it has come into my head he may be <hi rend="italic">waiting to be asked by you</hi>, and not yet have called? This is the needful in regard to Watts. I gave him y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> message punctually, in all points; &#x26; in all he ans<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, &#x0201C;Good, good.&#x0201D;<note n="5" noteref="646">Forster replied, <date when="1868-05-07">7 May</date>, that he had written to Watts to arrange to see him within the next few days, and would call on TC as soon as he had seen Watts.</note>
</p>
<p>In regard to <hi rend="italic">dividing</hi> of the &#x0201C;Library Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x0201D; I find great difficulties,&#x02014;and no <hi rend="italic">outlet</hi> but a good few more <hi rend="italic">volumes</hi> than Chap<hi rend="italic">n</hi> contemplates, <hi rend="italic">Sartor, Shiller</hi>,<note n="6" noteref="647">TC omitted &#x0201C;c&#x0201D; in Schiller.</note>
 <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Sterling</hi> are all ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 300 or 310 pages; the voll. that go with them are all pretty near 500 (none of them <hi rend="italic">above</hi>, but none of them much below that cipher): I counted today; and c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> see no <hi rend="italic">handsome</hi> way, but that of making <hi rend="italic">Fr</hi>h <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi> 3 voll., <hi rend="italic">Crom</hi>ll 5 voll., <hi rend="italic">Miscell</hi>s (with <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> &#x26;c) 6 voll., &#x26; <hi rend="italic">Friedr</hi>h 10 volumes! <hi rend="italic">This</hi> brings the sizes within some limit of similarity,&#x02014;not above 100 pages difference in any case. What is the in<hi rend="italic">super</hi>able difficulty to this?<note n="7" noteref="648">Forster replied, <date when="1868-05-07">7 May</date>: &#x0201C;I will go to Chapman &#x26; arrange as to number of volumes. There will be no difficulty. What you propose seems to me <hi rend="italic">quite right</hi>.&#x0201D; The library edn. (30 vols.) pbd. this number of vols. for each work; for full details, see Tarr 449.</note>
 I am quite at a fix, and in a darkness, regarding it, for the time being.<note n="8" noteref="649">TC noted in his journal, [<date when="1868-04-27">27 April</date>]: &#x0201C;Forster &#x02026; has &#x02018;the Library Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x02019; (of my poor <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>) almost under way!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>

</p>
<p>I am very anxious to hear that y<hi rend="italic">r type&#x02014;founding</hi> preliminary is complete; that you have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the proper amount of <hi rend="italic">letter</hi>;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> am ready to begin at a moment&#x02019;s notice from you; let not a moment be lost!

<p>The <hi rend="italic">divis</hi>n <hi rend="italic">into voll</hi>., of &#x0201C;Library Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x0201D; is perfectly settled; 30 voll (<hi rend="italic">excluding</hi> the <hi rend="italic">W.

 voll. ranging from 310 pp. to 100 more (scarcely one of them going much higher; <hi rend="italic">Fried</hi>h in <hi rend="italic">10</hi> voll &#x26;c &#x26;c),&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">copy</hi> from beginning to end is lying as good as <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> for you. Let us start, let us start!&#x02014;</p>
<p>That <hi rend="italic">abolition</hi> of Capitals in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, I find, will never do; abolit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> quasi-total, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> in many places considerably obscures the sense (or comprehensibility in reading):<note n="3" noteref="658">TC had been following the German convention of capitalizing nouns in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>.

<p><salute>Dear Sister,&#x02014;</salute>The Dr is at Vichy,<note n="1" noteref="661">John A. Carlyle arrived to stay with TC, <date when="1868-04-29">29 April</date>, before leaving for Vichy, <date when="1868-05-14">14 May</date>; TC noted, <date when="1868-05-24">24 May</date>: &#x0201C;B<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John came punctually; was good, studious to be good;&#x02014;but seldom has the art of <hi rend="italic">sitting still</hi> &#x02026; and knocks me ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> too much when we are long close together. W<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fain have persuaded me to Vichy with him; yet, considerately, did not press it, seeing I had no taste for it, almost no hope of my own in it. &#x02026; He sorted up all my acc<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> the <hi rend="italic">American</hi> concerns (thanks to him);&#x02014;staid in all only 16 days; then went himself off to Vichy&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).</note>
 all right, so far; as you will see by those two <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>;<note n="2" noteref="662">John A. Carlyle sent TC a short note, <date when="1868-05-15">15 May</date>, to say he had arrived safely in France, and a longer letter, <date when="1868-05-16">16 May</date>, to say he was now in Vichy. He concluded his letter: &#x0201C;I have not time to write to any one else today. You might send this on to Jean at Dumfries with charge to send a word to the Gill &#x26; Scotsbrig.&#x0201D;</note>
&#x02014;the first of them I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have sent you, had I known you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> yesterday; but I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, by the tone of it, you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get another of the same. All has gone right to a fair degree;&#x02014;as I make no doubt &#x0201C;Vichy,&#x0201D; nay the very journey <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Vichy, and total change for a month, will have very good effects. I myself <hi rend="italic">c</hi>d not go, just at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, had I even inclined,&#x02014;so bothered &#x26; jumbled, getting that &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Library</hi> Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x0201D; set afloat. Once <hi rend="italic">afloat</hi> it will have to go on, I compute, for about 3 years before it quite end! Whether I shall ever see <hi rend="italic">it</hi> end, may well be a quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; but I am willing to take some charge, and &#x0201C;set my house in order&#x0201D;<note n="3" noteref="663">Cf.

 there too, so long as I am continued in it. &#x0201C;Charge,&#x0201D; at the perpetual expense of torment and <hi rend="italic">want of sleep</hi> stands me a good deal dearer than it does another; and as to Vichy,&#x02014;if it did me any <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> differ from all the things I ever tried hitherto: that is one sad truth!&#x02014; The Otthenins passed here last Friday (hurled a vague <hi rend="italic">Telegram</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> proved impossible): John having missed them at Paris, has no chance to be near them farther.<note n="4" noteref="664">Mme.

&#x02014;&#x02014; &#x02014; On the whole, you are to <hi rend="italic">communicate</hi> this Vichy news to The Gill &#x26; Scotsbrig; the Letters themselves, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> probably w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be very intelligible there, you may send <hi rend="italic">back</hi> to me, so soon as done with.</p>

 tho&#x02019; that, you will say, is a small matter: &#x26; truly in comparison with some others it is not a big.

In the letter Montcalm warned that if the British forces defeated the French on the Plains of Abraham, the French would lose North America; he also predicted that the American colonists would eventually revolt against the British.

Beatson, <hi rend="italic">The Plains of Abraham</hi> (Gibraltar, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>) 38&#x02013;42; Beatson gave his source as a pamphlet of Montcalm&#x02019;s letters, <hi rend="italic">Lettres de Monsieur le marquis de Montcalm &#x02026; &#x000E0; messieurs de Berryer et de La Mol&#x000E9; &#x02026; 1757&#x02013;59</hi> (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>), which TC had been unable to find.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to hear you have got so reasonably well to Vichy, and are likely to get benefit and do well there. Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Paris Newsp<hi rend="italic">r</hi> came on Friday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi><note n="1" noteref="671">John A. Carlyle sent newspapers to both TC and Jean Aitken, <date when="1868-05-14">14 May</date>, announcing his arrival in Paris.</note>
 (well worth its postage); the agitated bit of note testifying to want of sleep (I feared), arrived Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> morning,&#x02014;I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of sending <hi rend="italic">it</hi> on to Dumfries, but tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> they might have got something of the same; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it seems they hadn&#x02019;t quite. At length, on Monday morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, came y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Vichy Letter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was very welcome to me; &#x26; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I was only <hi rend="italic">too</hi> hasty in forwarding as bidden! I sent it off, namely (being otherwise sadly hurried), <hi rend="italic">without</hi> copying the name of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Vichy H&#x000F4;tel;<note n="2" noteref="672">John A. Carlyle was staying at the H&#x000F4;tel du Luxembourg, Vichy.</note>
 I discovered n<hi rend="italic">r</hi> midnight what a blunder I had made; instantly wrote a line to Jean; and behold, according to my <hi rend="italic">best</hi> hopes here (3 p.m.) is the Letter back from Dumfries, &#x26; I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write today, as was my condit<hi rend="italic">l</hi> purpose. Another time I will be warier. Except for this blunder I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have written yesterday.&#x02014; It is very pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that the Vichy Problem hitherto promises so well, and has been satisfactory on all points. If y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> H&#x000F4;tel Lux<hi rend="italic">g</hi> prove quiet, clean &#x26; wholesome, the price seems to me perfectly moderate;<note n="3" noteref="673">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1868-05-16">16 May</date>: &#x0201C;My rent per day is to be 8&#xbd; francs including everything, or 6&#xbd; fr. cheaper than the dearest hotels here.&#x0201D;</note>
 furthermore if you <hi rend="italic">don&#x02019;t</hi> like to continue there, it appears there are other resources in plenty. A pretty Town, too, with Parks, walks, broad solid streets, and shade attainable;&#x02014;if you can stand the <hi rend="italic">heat</hi>, it will do altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> well. For the heat I practically recommend two things: that you get a <hi rend="italic">straw</hi> or <hi rend="italic">grass</hi> Hat with broad brim (far superior to any wide-awake); and secondly that you don&#x02019;t be <hi rend="italic">rash</hi> <pb id="pg-45-133" n="45:133"/>in peeling y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self barer of clothes,&#x02014;very dangerous for colds, that latter mistake. The heat here yesterday (no <hi rend="italic">rain</hi> hitherto, &#x26; wind wavering bet<hi rend="italic">n zero</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">west</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) was very disagreeable, both day &#x26; night.

<salute>Dear Laing,</salute>
<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> welcome little Book of <hi rend="italic">Godly Ballatis</hi><note n="1" noteref="685"><hi rend="italic">A Compendious Book of Psalms and Spiritual Songs, Commonly Known as &#x02018;The Gude and Godlie Ballates&#x02019;</hi> reprinted from the <date when="1578-00-00">1578</date> edn., ed. David Laing (Edinburgh, <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>). Laing replied, <date when="1868-05-25">25 May</date>: &#x0201C;I am glad that <hi rend="italic">the Gude &#x26; Godly Ballads</hi> are likely to interest you. I never thought of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Froude, but I sent a spare copy to your care by yesterday&#x02019;s book post&#x02014;so pray ask him to retain for his own use, the one formerly sent.&#x0201D;</note>
 reached me duly ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a week ago: but Froude greedily snatched it away, the very day of its arrival; and I am not yet to have it back for three or four days more. From almost my childhood, I have had a curiousity ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that notable production; and now, for the first time, I shall be permitted to look into the face of it, and read it carefully with the necessary helps. You have surely ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> done a good work, in rescuing this old Book into daylight; and I return you many thanks for my own special share in the adventure. The <hi rend="italic">Nova Scotia Papers</hi>,<note n="2" noteref="686">Laing had sent <hi rend="italic">Royal Letters</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Charters and Tracts: Relating to the Colonization of New Scotland, and the Institution of the Order of Knights Baronets of Nova Scotia, <date when="1621-00-00">1621</date>&#x02013;<date when="1638-00-00">38</date></hi> to TC the previous summer; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18670831-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1867-08-31">31 Aug. 1867</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680122-TC-DL-01">TC to DL, <date when="1868-01-22">22 Jan.</date></ref></note>
 too, I had, and read with thanks Go on &#x26; prosper, in these good industries, while time still is!</p>
<p>My Brother, who had lately been in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, reported well of you: he is now, since Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last, safe settled at Vichy, looking forward to comfortable profit there, and finding the place, at any rate, pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and pretty. Fain w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> he have dragged me with him; but, at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> especially, it was not possible. At pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> there is great &#x0201C;printing&#x0201D; astir; the Book <hi rend="italic">Friedrich</hi> getting stereotyped in <hi rend="italic">small</hi> shape, like the others;&#x02014;and furthermore (what is still haggling among the shoals and the preliminaries) a &#x0201C;Library Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x0201D; of all the Books, (poor wretches!)&#x02014;of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I consent (drearily enough, at this epoch) to take some charge, so long as I continue beside it. But there are &#x0201C;30 voll.,&#x0201D;&#x02014;at least 3 years of <hi rend="italic">time</hi>, as I count;&#x02014;not yet fairly got <hi rend="italic">begun</hi>; and nobody knows who of us will see it <hi rend="italic">end</hi>! The small Fried<hi rend="italic">h</hi> itself, is little more than half done; and costs me always more or less of bother: absolutely <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> to have <hi rend="italic">it</hi> done strictly with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> supervis<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of my own.&#x02014; By the way, there is a <hi rend="italic">Leipzig</hi> reprint of that Book here,<note n="3" noteref="687">The German edn. in English of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, 13 vols., pbd. in Leipzig, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>&#x02013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>, by Bernhard Tauchnitz (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x02013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>); see <a href="..volume/42/biographicalNotes"><sic>42:239</sic></a> and Tarr 187.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Last night, came y<hi rend="italic">r Moniteur</hi>,<note n="1" noteref="702"><hi rend="italic">Le Moniteur Universel</hi>, Paris newspaper, established 1789.</note>
 with the welcome symbol;<note n="2" noteref="703">Pen strokes on the newspaper indicating that all was well.</note>
&#x02014;judging by the dates, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not but admire the rapidity; a <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>, published at Paris on &#x0201C;Thursday,&#x0201D; goes to Vichy, is purchased there, wrapt up and despatched; and reaches Chelsea, Friday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> in time for Tea: this is surely a great rate of <hi rend="italic">speed</hi> (even allowing for the editorial <hi rend="italic">expedients</hi> as to <hi rend="italic">dating</hi> their Paris &#x0201C;Thursday&#x0201D;)!&#x02014; &#x02014; I had got y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Vichy <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> on Monday morning last; and of course it was very much more instructive to me; indeed a very interesting and welcome <pb id="pg-45-140" n="45:140"/><pb id="pg-45-141" n="45:141"/>Piece, bringing y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own procedures, and the scene you are in quite vividly before me. As you said Jean was to have a Letter for herself by the same post, I did not send mine straight on to Dumfries; but since then I inclosed it for Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi> at Liverpool (in an <hi rend="italic">order for Tobacco</hi>!<note n="3" noteref="704">TC noted in his checkbook: &#x0201C;<date when="1868-06-01">1 june 1868</date> / To Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Aitken (L<hi rend="italic">r</hi>pool, <hi rend="italic">Tobacco</hi>) / &#x000A3;2 .. 12 .. 3&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).</note>
&#x02014;tobacco just <hi rend="italic">arrived</hi> this minute); &#x26; Jean, I have no doubt, has got it to hand before now.&#x02014; I have not yet <hi rend="italic">got</hi> &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Public Opinion</hi>&#x0201D;<note n="4" noteref="705">John A.

 (disorderly newsman); but I have it, in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, time enough for Sat<hi rend="italic">y&#x02019;s</hi> post, &#x26; you shall see it by the earliest chance there <hi rend="italic">is</hi>.

<p>You seem to have had considerable tumbling and preliminary bother &#x26; stress, in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> new element; but I flatter myself are now continuing to prosper, &#x26; find the thing ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, as y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter taught me to expect.<note n="5" noteref="706">John A.

I took too long walks at first &#x02026; &#x26; felt very miserable after dinner &#x02026; &#x26; then I began to doubt whether I really knew or could ascertain the conditions for giving the waters here a fair trial, by reading different books on the subject. I ended by consulting Dr Senac (Duffy&#x02019;s doctor) who has experience enough, &#x26; he speedily explained every thing to my satisfaction. Three half glasses of the water to be drunk regularly before breakfast, &#x26; also before dinner, no mineral baths, complete ablution with simple cold water the first thing every morning. Simple diet, but <hi rend="italic">dejeuner &#x000E0; la fourchette</hi> indispensable during the cure. And so I seem now to have got into the right course &#x26; feel steadily better to a certain degree, Senac telling me I am not to expect complete result till a month or two after end of my drinking. I saw him today again, &#x26; he tells me I am going on well.&#x0201D; Duffy had recommended Vichy to TC; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680301-TC-CGD-01">TC to CGD, <date when="1868-03-01">1 March</date></ref>.

 one may hope y<hi rend="italic">r Cure</hi> will be completed then, for <hi rend="italic">then</hi> will be the time to <hi rend="italic">run</hi>, cure or no cure!</p>
<p>I am myself quite in the old posture; not worse in health, no; nor unhappier, only <hi rend="italic">stiller</hi> and sadder as well,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am willingest to be.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am sorry to ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> that it is entirely impossible for me to make any movement in regard to the Miss Glen<note n="1" noteref="723">Mary Glen (b. ca. <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date> ), da. of Rev.

TC lodged with the Glens in Annan when Glen was minister there (see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 222) and helped their son John (b. 1817, now dead) obtain a civil list pension for the widowed Margaret Glen, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530429-TC-JOGL-01"><sic>28:122&#x02013;23</sic><corr>TC to JOGL, <date when="1853-04-29">29 April 1853</date></corr></ref>. Presumably now that she too had died, Swan was hoping to get the pension transferred to Mary Glen. For the history of the Glens, see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 222&#x02013;26.</note>

</p>
<p>My health has not sensibly altered since you saw me last,<note n="4" noteref="726">TC last saw Swan when he was in Edinburgh for his rectorial address (see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660403-TC-JWC-01"><sic>43:157</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1866-04-03">3 April 1866</date></corr></ref>); he also saw Margaret Glen then; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 225&#x02013;26.</note>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>The day you went I called on Chapman: he fell away from the &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">expense</hi>&#x0201D; considerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and indeed had nothing to urge for himself, except (what I gradually came to <hi rend="italic">believe</hi>) that the Public hearing of a &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Library</hi> Edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x0201D; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> more or less shudder at the sight of less <hi rend="italic">tall</hi> volumes, &#x26; deny, or scantily furnish, their most sweet <hi rend="italic">subscript</hi>ns in Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> next. He also shewed me some volumes of <hi rend="italic">Thackeray&#x02019;s Works</hi>, hard bigger in size than the shortest of mine; the <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I did not dislike.<note n="1" noteref="741">William Makepeace Thackeray (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x02013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27155"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), novelist; six of his works were pbd. by Chapman &#x26; Hall: <hi rend="italic">The Irish Sketch Book</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>); <hi rend="italic">Notes of a Journey from Cornhill to Cairo</hi> (<date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>); <hi rend="italic">Mrs. Perkins&#x02019;s Ball</hi> (<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>); <hi rend="italic">Our Street</hi> (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>); <hi rend="italic">Doctor Birch and his Young Friends</hi> (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>); and <hi rend="italic">Rebecca and Rowena</hi> (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>).

<p>On the whole, if you find Chapman sincere (as I think you will) in regard to this of the Public &#x0201C;shuddering&#x0201D; never so little, pray let him have his way. And in that case, Robson, if you go to him, will need nothing but a new admonit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (rather <hi rend="italic">strict</hi>, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be useful) to get on with his work, at lowest to let us see him begin it!&#x02014; I am sorry &#x26; ashamed, dear Forster, to bother you with all these <hi rend="italic">nugae</hi> [trifles] (the reverse of <hi rend="italic">canorae</hi> [musical]<note n="2" noteref="742">Nugae canorae, a phrase meaning musical trifles, often used as a title for collections of lighthearted songs or poems.</note>
; &#x02014;but indeed it is partly y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own blame, and you won&#x02019;t be forbidden by me.&#x02014;</p>
<p>I hope you will get home tomorrow, uninjured by the toils &#x26; the skyey influences; I am to ride at 2&#xbd; p.m. that day; at home after that, silent all the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>.

 and that in stating, as bound, what my own clear knowledge of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> qualities was, I have strictly held by that, and abstained from more.

At a meeting of the Curators, <date when="1868-06-04">4 June</date>, Black had requested that an extension be granted to Henry Calderwood to submit his testimonials, despite objections that the public announcement of the professorship had stipulated that no testimonials would be received after <date when="1868-06-01">1 June</date>.</note>
&#x02014;that, to secure my own conscience in the matter, a few plainer words seem needful.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-45-151" n="45:151"/>To what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I have said of you already therefore, I now volunteer to add, That I think you not only the one man in Britain capable of bringing Metaphysical Philosophy, in the ultimate, German or European, and highest actual form of it, distinctly home to the understanding of British men who wish to understand it; but that I notice in you farther, on the Moral side, a sound strength of intellectual discernment, a noble valour and reverence of mind, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seems to me to mark you out as the man capable of doing us the highest service in Ethical Science too; that of restoring, or decisively beginning to restore, the Doctrine of Morals to what I must ever reckon its one true and everlasting basis (namely the Divine or <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>-sensual one), and thus of victoriously reconciling and rendering identical the latest Dictates of Modern Science with the earliest Dawnings of Wisdom among the Race of Man. This is truly my opinion;&#x02014;and how import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me, not for the sake of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> University alone, but of the whole world for ages to come, I need not say to you!<note n="4" noteref="764">TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1868-06-16">16 June</date>: &#x0201C;Wrote a final Note to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Stirling, in hope of securing his elect<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to Chair of &#x02018;Moral Philosophy&#x02019; there.

<salute>Dear Stirling,</salute>
<p>Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> an hour before y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter &#x26;c arrived,<note n="1" noteref="766">Stirling wrote, <date when="1868-06-19">19 June</date>, thanking TC for his &#x0201C;exceedingly warm and to me invaluable letter. &#x02026; It has made my fall light.&#x0201D;</note>
 Mr Syme had come in (with similar Newspaper documents); and shocked me by the astonishing <pb id="pg-45-152" n="45:152"/>news!<note n="2" noteref="767">James Syme; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680324-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1868-03-24">24 March</date></ref>. Stirling sent TC copies of the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Evening Courant</hi> of <date when="1868-06-19">19 June</date>, writing: &#x0201C;I fear you will be sorely displeased to see your letter in them. I read it in the first instance to Mr. Black, who was deeply shaken, but confessed himself &#x02018;committed to another.&#x02019; I &#x02026; ordered 25 copies to be printed for the Curators &#x26; friends. So far as the Newspapers are concerned, there was no authority, no request, &#x26; no expectation on my part. &#x02026; I trust &#x02026; you will kindly pardon any annoyance this matter may have occasioned.&#x0201D; At the meeting of the Curators, <date when="1868-06-18">18 June</date>, Henry Calderwood was elected to the chair of moral philosophy.</note>
 Nothing like it that I remember, has occurred there in my time. Fie, fie!&#x02014; On the whole, since they were at it, I am better pleased they chose Calderwood of the two,<note n="3" noteref="768">The <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Evening Courant</hi> reported, <date when="1868-06-19">19 June</date>: &#x0201C;Election to the Chair of Moral Philosophy &#x02026; There were in all ten candidates, but only two were proposed&#x02014;Professor Flint, St. Andrew&#x02019;s; and the Rev. Henry Calderwood. &#x02026; Four voted for Dr. Calderwood&#x02014;viz. the Lord Provost [Chambers], Baillie Russell, Baillie Fyfe, and Mr Adam Black. Three voted for Professor Flint&#x02014;viz., the Lord-Justice General [Inglis], Sir Wm. Gibson-Craig, and Mr. Milne Holme [Home]. Dr. Calderwood was thereupon declared to be elected to the vacant chair. One of the candidates for the professorship was Dr Stirling, who was spoken of very favourably, but not nominated.&#x0201D; Below the article, the <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> published TC&#x02019;s letter to Stirling of <date when="1868-06-16">16 June</date>.</note>
 and did their feat in so complete a style. Never mind, never mind. Such a <hi rend="italic">failure</hi> to you is worth ten successes of the Calderw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> kind;&#x02014;possibly too, nay by this time almost probably, it may turn to <hi rend="italic">good</hi> for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self and for all the world.<note n="4" noteref="769">Stirling replied, <date when="1868-07-12">12 July</date>: &#x0201C;Many thanks for this new kindness! You have indeed converted my defeat into a triumph, and I am deeply grateful.&#x0201D;</note>
</p>
<p>By the Newsp<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> copiously come to me, often in <hi rend="italic">duplicate</hi>) I see the immense excitat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and emotion of the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Public on this matter;<note n="5" noteref="770">In its editorial, the <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> commented: &#x0201C;[H]ow far the fact of being an acceptable U. P. [United Presbyterian] pastor constitutes a man capable of prelecting on Ethics in the Chair of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh. The fact, doubtless, gave him strong claims upon dissenting Curators, in whose small intellectual world anything like a science of Ethics may be a nonentity; but except it be natural and fitting to give a most important philosophical chair to a dissenting parson because he is a dissenter, it may not be easy to discover the grounds of Dr Calderwood&#x02019;s appointment. &#x02026; There might have been some excuse for the Curators if there had been a paucity of able and tried candidates known to all the world as men of philosophical power. But there were an abundance of these. &#x02026; A letter which we publish in another place from the Rector of the University will exhibit to some in its full light the heinous nature of the sin which has been committed against philosophy. We choose to speak of Dr Stirling, without the slightest reflection upon any other of the candidates, for several of whom we cherish the highest esteem, because his claims are brought under our notice by one who has a right to speak with some authority on anything relating to the University. And the testimony of Mr Carlyle is enough to show what <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of Professor Dr Stirling would have made. But Mr Carlyle has only expressed an opinion which is shared by all competent students of philosophy both here and in Germany.&#x0201D; Calderwood was a highly respected minister of the United Presbyterian Church, which had been formed, 1847, from the Relief Church and the United Secession Church, the latter having included the Burgher Church of which TC&#x02019;s parents had been members; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430814-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:46</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-14">14 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 and by no <pb id="pg-45-153" n="45:153"/>means wonder at it. But the one thing wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I notice of remedial nature is that of having you as Supplemental or Extraordinary Professor, you and, if needful, others to follow; and keep &#x0201C;ordinaries&#x0201D; awake at their guns henceforth! This seems to me excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; as I hope, it does to you,&#x02014;and that all effort will at once bend itself in that direct<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. In <hi rend="italic">Medicine</hi> it has worked well for the University interests; &#x26; I have often heard shrewd people desiderate such a thing for the other Professorships too whenever applicable to them.&#x02014; Certainly, in this instance, if the quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi> be ever asked of the &#x0201C;University Court&#x0201D; in my time there, I know one person who will strongly vote for it!<note n="6" noteref="771">The <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi>, <date when="1868-06-20">20 June</date>, published a letter from &#x0201C;X. Y. Z.&#x0201D;: &#x0201C;The medical school of Edinburgh has established lecturers beyond the walls of the University, and it might be well if, in the Faculty of Arts, the same privilege were accorded to the student&#x02014;the privilege of leaving an incompetent and obnoxious teacher, and learning the art from some eminent master outside. &#x02026; And this leads me to suggest &#x02026; that if our illustrious countryman, Dr Stirling, could be placed in, or could be induced to occupy such a position, there could be only one result. The official class-room occupied by the obscure U. P. would be deserted; the unofficial lecture hall of a great scientific teacher&#x02014;of one widely famous in the world of philosophy&#x02014;would be crowded, crowded not by students only, but by the literary <hi rend="italic">&#x000E9;lite</hi> of our city.&#x0201D; Stirling replied to TC, <date when="1868-07-12">12 July</date>: &#x0201C;The formation, so to speak, of an <hi rend="italic">extraordinariat</hi>, whence &#x02026; to supply the <hi rend="italic">ordinariat</hi> would indeed be a most excellent measure&#x0201D; but he went on to list six objections, ending with the fact that &#x0201C;it would be difficult to secure the support of the ecclesiastical bodies &#x02026; to say nothing of that of the University Court.&#x0201D;</note>
&#x02014; Go ahead, therefore!</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind little Note; I had been thinking of you very often, in my own seclusion, and the quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi> always rising, How is he? Happily I can now fancy you free on the breezy downs; and tearing lustily into the heart of <hi rend="italic">Landor</hi>,<note n="1" noteref="803">Forster wrote, <date when="1868-07-29">29 July</date>: &#x0201C;Next Monday is &#x02026; my last day at Whitehall, and though it seems but small change to turn from the Lunacy to the Landor Mill, I shall at least be turning and labouring at the last alone, and with free wholesome air blowing about me. The place is very pretty &#x26; you will come &#x26; see it.&#x0201D; Forster was staying in Coldblow, village nr. Banstead, Surrey, 3 mi. (5 km.)

 as you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be.</p>
<p>My own little Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Adventure, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> lasted near a fortnight,&#x02014;with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> pain to <pb id="pg-45-161" n="45:161"/>me except that of imprison<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, solitary ennui, and sad tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> wandering over the universe,&#x02014;seems to have succeeded perfectly; and, much beyond my own expectat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I really now think I shall derive some considerable benefit from it. Thank Heaven, and the excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Syme, skilfullest and helpfullest of men, a man of the finest frank good-hum<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, too, and honest as spring-water or the best Scotch <hi rend="italic">oatmeal</hi>!<note n="2" noteref="804">TC stayed with James Syme at Millbank House, Edinburgh, <date when="1868-07-14">14</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868-07-27">27 July</date>; his hernia operation was <date when="1868-07-15">15 July</date>, presumably in Millbank House. TC wrote, <date when="1868-07-26">[26] July</date>: &#x0201C;Have been here in the benefic<hi rend="italic">t</hi> skilful and excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Mr Syme&#x02019;s, under <hi rend="italic">surgical</hi> treatment (thanks to his signal kindness); and seem to be in the way of much <hi rend="italic">improv</hi>t (if I still prosper),&#x02014;at any rate, am now out of the curative process, and am much thankful with good reason&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).</note>

&#x02014; One or two Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> people he, latterly, bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> out to see me;<note n="4" noteref="806">David Masson later recalled: &#x0201C;[O]ne day, when Carlyle was convalescent, there was a quiet little dinner party at Millbank to meet him. Besides Syme and Carlyle, and one or two of the members of Syme&#x02019;s family, there were present only Dr. John Carlyle, Dr. John Brown, and myself. It was very pleasant, at the dinner table, to observe the attention paid by the manly, energetic, and generally peremptory and pugnacious, little surgeon to his important guest, his satisfaction in having him there, and his half-amused, half-wondering glances at him as a being of another <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> than his own, but whom he had found as lovable in private as he was publicly tremendous&#x0201D; (David Masson, <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Sketches &#x26; Memories</hi> [London and Edinburgh, <date when="1892-00-00">1892</date>], 405). Dr. John Brown (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x02013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3630"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician and author; friend of John A.

 but, except their good-nature to me, it was rather a burden than otherwise. The grand topic, I found was our little &#x0201C;Sir James,&#x0201D; or <hi rend="italic">Foxius</hi> II;<note n="5" noteref="807">Sir James Young Simpson; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680612-TC-DL-01">TC to DL, <date when="1868-06-12">12 June</date></ref>; &#x0201C;Foxius II&#x0201D; [words unclear] apparently refers to a soubriquet of Simpson&#x02019;s; Forster replied, <date when="1868-08-15">15 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;You would not think the gladness your little note gave here! &#x02026; Syme shall be the Saint of my kalendar. Yet our Foxy friend promises great things. &#x02026; Upon the whole, though I shall stand by Syme, I don&#x02019;t think he has much chance against Reynard.&#x0201D; For JWC&#x02019;s earlier critical opinion of Simpson, see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18641003-JWC-MR-01"><sic>41:59&#x02013;60</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1864-10-03">3 Oct. 1864</date>]</corr></ref>, and for her earlier extolling of Syme as &#x0201C;the best Surgeon in Britain,&#x0201D; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18631126-TC-JAC-01"><sic>39:249</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1863-11-26">26 Nov. 1863</date></corr></ref>. Syme and Simpson had long been bitter rivals in the medical world of Edinburgh (see John A. Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Simpson and Syme of Edinburgh</hi> [Edinburgh and London, <date when="1969-00-00">1969</date>]). The campaigning for the post of principal was very outspoken, Syme leading the campaign against Simpson; Sir Alexander Grant was elected to the post, <date when="1868-07-06">6 July</date>.</note>
&#x02014;whom I gradually grew to <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> to be verily a dangerous and reckless Q<hi rend="small-caps">uac</hi><hi rend="small-caps">k</hi> of the first order,&#x02014;whom simple people, simple women especially, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do well at all times to keep far from them!<note n="6" noteref="808">Simpson pioneered the use of chloroform in childbirth, not only for women in particular difficulties, but as a general aid; this however was seen as being against the natural order of things, in which women were supposed to bring forth children in pain. He also worked to try and help women who had difficulties conceiving, and sometimes arranged adoptions of unwanted babies.</note>
 The buz <pb id="pg-45-162" n="45:162"/>that went on ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> all this, and ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> other things equally extraneous to me, was curious to notice, and perhaps had beneficial tendencies.

The sight of the place cut me asunder with an uncontrollable emot<hi rend="italic">n</hi> sharper &#x26; sadder than any I have yet had. &#x02026; Tears flowed visibly; but I soon reflected, &#x02018;Well, it was <hi rend="italic">victory</hi> as well as death; a strenuously sore battle, right nobly <hi rend="italic">won</hi>!&#x02019; and a glow of pious <hi rend="italic">pride</hi> for my incomparable one, ran thro&#x02019; me, mingling with the endless sorrow wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is beyond remedy.&#x02014; I return for Dumfries tomorrow; and <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be thankful to God that lent me, poor me, the noblest of all woman as my Fellow-Pilgrim in this world.

<p>We are here ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> since Monday last: surely well off, I for one, and doing well.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am very much obliged by y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kindness in sending me the Cromwell Letter;<note n="1" noteref="817">Thoms had sent TC a copy of an &#x0201C;Original Letter of Cromwell&#x0201D; dated <date when="1645-04-28">28 April 1645</date>, which was printed in <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries</hi>, <date when="1868-08-08">8 Aug.</date></note>
 wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have read with great attention here, &#x26; must still farther investigate on getting back to my books. It is obviously a Cromwell beyond dispute; and curiously fits in with other Letters previously known; nay, I find, what is still more notable, <hi rend="italic">contradicts</hi> in one or two minute points (<hi rend="small-caps">minut</hi><hi rend="small-caps">e dates</hi> &#x26;c) what seems to be faithfully enough excerpted from <hi rend="italic">Rushworth</hi>:<note n="2" noteref="818">John Rushworth, <hi rend="italic">Historical Collections</hi>; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680722-TC-WA-01">TC to WA, <date when="1868-07-22">22 July</date></ref>.</note>

 <hi rend="italic">amendment</hi> of a thorough nature.</p>
<p>You must endeavour to compose y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self into calmness and clearness; and, with all the energy, patience, courage, insight and other faculty or virtue, that is in you, seek unweariedly for some <hi rend="italic">other</hi> honest employ<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; and never rest, or sit down discouraged, till you have found one. Employment, plenty of it, you will yet find in the world (never doubt) if you continue seeking faithfully!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I send you a small subvention,<note n="2" noteref="826">TC noted in his checkbook: &#x0201C;<date when="1868-08-24">24 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 1868</date> / W. J.

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesterday, in obedience to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> request, I had the Boy Joseph Bates<note n="1" noteref="828">Joseph Walker Bates, b. <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> in Alverthorpe, Yorkshire.</note>
 over to me here, some two hours, under what of survey and examinat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give him. He is a very handsome, clever-looking, well-mannered, modest, quiet and alert little Boy; perfectly healthy to appearance; finely formed, face, head and figure,&#x02014;face of fine <hi rend="italic">acquiline</hi> type, with bright hazel eyes, with features uncommonly expressive of delicacy, of vivacity, intelligence and solidity; altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> a prepossessing physiognomy.</p>
<p>In regard to Schooling, I judge him to have suffered much from <hi rend="italic">bad teachers</hi>, bad opportunities, interrupt<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> &#x26;c; and in effect, one is at first disagreeably surprised at his manifest deficiency in this partic<hi rend="italic">r</hi>;&#x02014;tho&#x02019; perhaps one <hi rend="italic">ends</hi> by surprise that honest <hi rend="italic">ignorance</hi> (and not perversity, discourage<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, idleness, and <hi rend="italic">unveracity</hi> of mind) perhaps be nearly all the mischief he has got by it! As matters stand, he knows of school learning, essentially almost nothing. He reads freely, yet with constant liability to blunder, in no case completely understanding what he reads; nay it appears to be a new idea to him that reading was a thing intended to be understood,&#x02014;or in fact that school-learning in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> was much other than a jumble of unintelligible <hi rend="italic">vocalisations</hi>, done to order, uncertain why.&#x02014; His handwriting is entirely unformed; tho&#x02019; in this, I believe, he does discern utility, and can write rational bits of Letters on his own little businesses. In Arithmetic he does not completely know the Multiplicat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Table. Of &#x0201C;English Grammar,&#x0201D; of &#x0201C;Geography&#x0201D; (after ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a year at each) he knows essentially nothing. Such the ill fortune of the poor Boy!</p>
<p>For, as above said, I impute this state of ignorance mainly or wholly to bad opportunities,&#x02014;on the whole, to bad <hi rend="italic">teaching</hi>, at once careless and faithless. And I am much mistaken if there is not in this little Boy a fund of intelligence and goodness wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will amply, amply and perhaps speedily reward the <hi rend="italic">good <pb id="pg-45-167" n="45:167"/>teacher</hi> who fairly tries him. Great <hi rend="italic">depth</hi> of gifts I do not pretend to divine in the Boy; but certainly a great deal of liveliness, precision, loyalty, alacrity,&#x02014;gifts capable of being trained to <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> performance of any of the common employ<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, functions &#x26; practicalities valued in the world.</p>
<p>This is my candid reading of poor little Bates, on the short acquaintance we have,&#x02014;two hours and no more. By testimony from without, I learn farther that he is an affectionate, uniformly faithful, punctual and well-behaved little Boy, very clever and correct in doing little jobs of messaging or the like; a testimony, and report of experience, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> on good ground are wholly credible to me.</p>
<p>I remain, Sir,&#x02014;wishing y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> noble Institut<hi rend="italic">n</hi><note n="2" noteref="829">The Crossley Orphanage was founded in <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date> to educate and apprentice children who had lost either both parents or just their father.</note>

John A.

I was taken to York along with the other witness now dead. Then Bates&#x02019; brothers offered us &#x000A3;100 a piece to swear that this was the signature of old Joseph Bates when we both knew <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had never seen it. I nudged t&#x02019;other man to come out for minute &#x26; said &#x02018;are we to sell our souls for a hunner pun a piece lad.&#x02019; &#x02018;We both thought no&#x02019; &#x26; went back &#x26; told them plainly that <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Joe Bates never knew ought of the will.

<p><salute>Pity me. &#x02026; Nay,</salute> I don&#x02019;t see you how are quite to avoid despising me as well. I was never so idle in my life before; but the region here is very beautiful, in the beautiful weather we again have; and to me it is not beautiful only, but almost supernatural, like the Valley of Mirza with its river and bridge.<note n="1" noteref="833">&#x0201C;The Vision of Mirza&#x0201D;: an allegorical tale by Joseph Addison (<date when="1672-00-00">1672</date>&#x02013;<date when="1719-00-00">1719</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/156"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), writer and politician, co-founder of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, in which most of his writings were initially pbd. The Vision is of the Vale of Misery, through which runs the river of eternity, and which is crossed by a bridge representing human life.</note>
 The charm of sauntering about here like a disembodied ghost, peacefully mournful, peacefully meditative, is considerable in comparison, and I repugn against quitting it.<note n="2" noteref="834">TC wrote, <date when="1868-09-01">1 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;A life vacant,&#x02014;filled only with mournful reflex<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> &#x26; reminiscences; sometimes poignantly and, oftener sluggishly and drearily so, tho&#x02019; tenderness &#x26; resignat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> are never totally wanting to me. The blazing heat (hottest year I ever saw, and the <hi rend="italic">driest</hi> of all since <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>) is now quite over: the scene is very beautiful, and to me, in my prevailing moods, has something of sadness, of sacredness,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">sad</hi> enough, at all times, &#x26; for many reasons! &#x02026; Ought really to get &#x02018;home&#x02019; ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> now; often feel that this <hi rend="italic">sluggardice</hi> sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> end; some <hi rend="italic">employ</hi>t begin. On the other hand, Sister Jean (who has been and is the kindest of Sisters to me) insists that I am confessedly a little better in health (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed I seem to be), and that I ought to take all the fine weather there is. My laziness, my <hi rend="italic">lothness</hi> to take the trouble of lifting are clear; that is now really the chief cause of my lingering here! Have been twice at the Gill, and (Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last [<date when="1868-08-29">29 Aug.</date>]) took leave there;&#x02014;have not seen Scotsbrig, Jamie having strangers &#x26;c.

Lord Bacon is here &#x02026; could you not, and would you not, look in upon us once more?&#x0201D; Thomas Spedding&#x02019;s brother, James, editor and biographer of Francis Bacon, was often referred to as &#x0201C;Lord Bacon&#x0201D;; cf. 35:202. The <hi rend="italic">Athen&#xe6;um</hi>, <date when="1868-11-21">21 Nov.</date>, pbd a review of Spedding&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">The Letters and the Life of Francis Bacon</hi>, vols. III and IV: &#x0201C;He has taken much time&#x02014;seven years&#x02014;over these two volumes; but he has not taken the time to be brief. &#x02026; Such as the book is, however, we must take it. We cannot change the method. After all, a learned man has the right to proceed in his own way: and if the way is dull, and the pace wearisome, a reader need not follow far. Even as it stands, with all its sins upon its head, this edition of Lord Bacon&#x02019;s works is one that we are glad to range on a convenient shelf&#x0201D; (671&#x02013;72).</note>
 &#x26; you all, in the memory of days that <pb id="pg-45-169" n="45:169"/>are now far away! Unluckily I go for Chelsea next week; and can only send you my kindly regrets and ineffectual good-wishes as I whirl thro&#x02019; the Mountains,&#x02014;probably on Thursday next,&#x02014;towards a &#x0201C;Home&#x0201D; now fallen vacant enough to me.</p>
<p>I have been silent here for well-nigh two months; idler than I almost ever was before; totally secluded from everybody, a life of mere reverie and reminiscence, mournful all of it, but possibly not quite unprofitable all;<note n="2" noteref="837">For TC&#x02019;s ruminations on his life in Dumfries, <date when="1868-09-01">1 Sept.</date>, see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680820-TC-WTHO-01">TC to WTHO, <date when="1868-08-20">20 Aug.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680908-TC-CDB-01"><corr>TC to CDB, <date when="1868-09-08">8 Sept.</date></corr></ref> He wrote, <date when="1868-09-08">8 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;Weather altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> bright and fine; a beautiful Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> come, and visibly greener than common. <hi rend="italic">Idle</hi> as ever, I; and <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi> impotently ought to be away &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).</note>

<salute>Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>. . . .Checque the beginning of next week.<note n="1" noteref="841">Alexander (Alex or Alick) Welsh, a cousin of JWC, was trying to extricate his brother Walter from debt.

Maggie Welsh wrote, <date when="1868-08-29">29 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;We were <hi rend="italic">sorely</hi> hurt when Walter told us that he had written as he had done to you; he showed me afterwards your kind reply&#x02014;I do beg you to believe dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle &#x02026; that we <hi rend="italic">all</hi> do think that in what you have said &#x26; done, you have done for Walter, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> merely what one knows well was the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> thing, but the VERY KINDEST. It has almost broken one&#x02019;s heart to learn much that poor Walter has now told me, &#x26; the more that had he frankly spoken of his troubles years ago, much that is painful, independent of the actual debts, might have been avoided for himself &#x26; for us. &#x02026; How it will end for poor Walter we do not yet know&#x02014;we hope to be able to come to some arrangement which may make it possible for Walter to go on here [in Auchtertool Manse]. Alex, Jeanie &#x26; I have made an offer to the creditors to do as <hi rend="italic">much as we can</hi> in the meantime, &#x26; we hope it may be agreed to. Poor Alex &#x02026; feels all this most <hi rend="italic">bitterly</hi>, &#x26; the more so that he is not in a position to take the burden of it on himself. &#x02026; Please give my best regards to your brother&#x02014;who has been very kind.&#x0201D; John A. Carlyle had apparently lent Walter money some years previously; he wrote to TC, <date when="1867-02-25">25 Feb. 1867</date>: &#x0201C;Walter Welsh&#x02019;s letter about the loan was most temperate &#x26; well-conditioned. &#x02026; He has always been most anxious to pay, &#x26; is so still&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1775C.91). Maggie also told TC that Mary Welsh was going to Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, to stay with a friend, probably for the winter, and that Alex wanted her to go to stay with them in Liverpool &#x0201C;for a while.&#x0201D; Walter Welsh remained the minister at Auchtertool until his death; he d. unmarried <date when="1879-12-00">Dec. 1879</date>.</note>

Alexander Carlyle noted: &#x0201C;Captain James Baillie, Mrs. Carlyle&#x02019;s cousin, who had long ere this date squandered his large fortune and fallen into indigent circumstances. Carlyle had for many years prior to this been in the habit of making Baillie a present of &#x000A3;20 annually; but with his usual delicacy, he withheld his name, and employed his nephew, James Aitken, as his intermediary. Baillie died in 1873; and Carlyle continued the gift (of &#x000A3;10 half-yearly) to &#x02018;Mrs. Baillie,&#x02019; leaving informal instructions that, after his own death, the sum should still be given her while she lived. Carlyle&#x02019;s executors could not carry out his intention; but the half-yearly &#x000A3;10 was supplied at her own expense by the late Mrs. Alexander Carlyle [Mary Aitken], until it was no longer needed&#x0201D; (A.

 unfortunate quadruped, has ended his career, at least his career in Grosvenor Street,&#x02014;not in death, but in almost worse, in dishon<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and exclusion henceforth from the list of <hi rend="italic">cavalry</hi> horses! It was the very day y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> letter came, the coach<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (his <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Errand to me; I know whose bidding his <hi rend="italic">first</hi> was) bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the actual acceptable Comet here,&#x02014;who at once recognised me, with seeming joy, and in spite of his obesity set off with a willing foot and mind; but, alas, alas, in ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> half an hour,&#x02014;splashed himself suddenly on the ground, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> reason shown; cut his eyebrow and both his knees (I know not whether to a <hi rend="italic">marked</hi> degree either of these latter); and <pb id="pg-45-180" n="45:180"/>rose a disgraced and ruined little horse!

<p>My theory is that nothing whatever ails his <hi rend="italic">pastern</hi> or other joints; that it is mere idleness, and luxurious feeding within doors, that has hebetated into utter torpor his fine faculties, muscles, and energies; that he is a beautiful, a strong, loyally willing and <hi rend="italic">good</hi> little horse;&#x02014;who, in a <hi rend="italic">pony phaeton</hi> (with 4 wheels on it!) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do splendid service, and nobly earn his bread in the world; but who has forfeited the right to <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> any farther.</p>
<p>This I take to be the real truth;&#x02014;a sad winding up of all y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kindness in this respect, to a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> undeserving person; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> nobody c<hi rend="italic">d persuade</hi> you out of (at least I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi>n&#x02019;t); but now you see fate has!

<p>You w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have had a longer and more pleasant Letter today, but for an accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> befel last night,&#x02014;in the matter of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> only: total vigilance, with considerable rambling ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, till ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 8 a.m., after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> one hour of <hi rend="italic">night-mare</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was all my allowance; much the worst night I have had since leaving Scotland and my loving ones:&#x02014;had <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi> been there (I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>), she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have made me a mess of first-rate <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi>, so savoury to the soul; and my ultimate fate had been far more tolerable. As it is, my day is ruined; good for nothing at all; and had it not been a foregone resolution, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not even have written you this.</p>
<p>Not that my sleep usually is bad here; the reverse of that; it is fairly a little <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> from the Dumfries standard: and indeed I usually flatter myself that, in health altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I am fairly a little <hi rend="italic">better</hi> for my Scotch journey and adventures, can walk better and farther (and so <hi rend="italic">do</hi>), am nothing like so flatulent, <pb id="pg-45-181" n="45:181"/>collapsed and miserable, for most part, as I habitually was;&#x02014;feel my sad existence a kind of piously sad one, not unfit for my years; and am ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> stirring to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> if there be not still some little of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> (for the sake of those who have left me) that I may still piously do, while days are continued me. O unworthy, unworthy me; to lie down and idly moan: how <hi rend="italic">much</hi> more, infinitely more have I seen suffered in silence, and the day&#x02019;s duty always done as the day went! Let us hope I may rally myself before too late!&#x02014; &#x02014; Mary and I are, for one thing, wonderfully <hi rend="italic">regular</hi>; dinner at 6; walk from 11 or earlier; bed never later than 1 a.m. (with a tendency to become 12); up (mostly) ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 8; &#x26;c &#x26;c: good omens, you will say?</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Riding</hi>, how<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, is now fairly <hi rend="italic">over</hi>: above a week ago, I had the once gallant little &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Comet</hi>&#x0201D; bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> down to me here; delighted to see me the poor creature seemed; but, alas, <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi> darkness and abund<hi rend="italic">t</hi> oats, continued for 2 years, had undermined and hebetated, and in fact ruined the once glorious &#x0201C;Comet&#x0201D;: so that, in ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> half an hour, roads good, riding gentlest and carefullest, glorious Comet-splashed utterly down, cut <hi rend="italic">eye-brow</hi> and both knees; horse and rider fairly tracing out their united <hi rend="italic">Profile</hi> on the soil of Middlesex (in the Holland-House region, silent eleg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> new streets sout<supplied>[h]</supplied> of that,<note n="1" noteref="882">The Holland estate, Kensington, which had gradually been being sold for development since the <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>s.</note>
 hardly anybody seeing the phenom<hi rend="italic">n</hi>)!

Ignorant, careless and lazy grooms; not to give the little Horse his <hi rend="italic">exercise</hi> (unless he c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get it <hi rend="italic">gratis</hi>), but merely to fling in <hi rend="italic">oats</hi>; glad that even the <hi rend="italic">want of currying</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never be noticed (except by <hi rend="italic">me</hi>)!&#x02014; I got Miss B&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> to my bad news, this morning; handsome wholly (as I never doubted but it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be): here it is inclosed for you.</p>

<salute>Dear Stirling,</salute>
<p>This voice from New Engl<hi rend="italic">d</hi><note n="1" noteref="896">Stirling wrote, <date when="1868-10-7">7 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;I beg to be allowed to send you the enclosed letter for perusal. I thought it my duty to submit this matter to you.&#x0201D; The letter was from Dr. Francis Bowen (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x02013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>), Alford professor of natural religion, moral philosophy, and civil polity, Harvard Coll., asking whether Stirling would be &#x0201C;willing to emigrate to the United States, and become my colleague here by accepting a Professorship of Metaphysics in Harvard College&#x0201D;; the professorship did not yet exist, but if Stirling accepted the offer Bowen would move to get it endowed (<hi rend="italic">Stirling</hi> 212).</note>
 is a sufficient triumph over the d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> from the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Baillies,<note n="2" noteref="897">Stirling hoped to get the chair of moral philosophy at Edinburgh Univ., but was voted against by the town council members of the board of curators; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680626-TC-JHS-01"><corr>TC to JHS, <date when="1868-06-26">26 June</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 if you needed any triumph over such a thing: but I can well fancy it must be gravely embarrassing to you, no less than gratifying. I wish there were in me any course that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> avail, in return for the trust you show in asking it! I will at least put down what my vague and distant <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> notions of it are,&#x02014;as clearly as I can, in this sad whirl of bothers I am in today; not to keep you waiting longer.</p>
<p>Profess<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bowen seems a very friendly, honest &#x26; candid man; and I doubt not may pass for a sample of the gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> feeling you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> meet with in Harvard, in Boston, and over New England and intellectual America at large. They are an honest, faithful, intellig<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and really friendly people; and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> receive you (as I have instances to teach me) with brotherly welcome, not <hi rend="italic">vocal</hi> only, and be proud and glad to lend you practical furtherance wherever feasible. They much respect talent and proficiency; are a very clear-seeing people, the better kinds of them; and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> make, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Harvard especially, a fairly desirable public for a man to lecture to. In fact they seem to me to have many <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> features; Boston not unlike Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> probably,&#x02014;deducting perhaps the huge admirat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for <hi rend="italic">America</hi>, Nigger Emancipat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x26;c, or <hi rend="italic">substituting</hi> it for d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of Scotland, and of some equally egregious nonsense of our own! Emerson himself, I have understood, is some kind of Head Supervisor (permanent &#x0201C;L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Rector,&#x0201D; one of <note n="3" noteref="898">Ralph Waldo Emerson served as a member of the Board of Overseers, Harvard Coll., <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>.</note>
, perhaps <hi rend="italic">not</hi> altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Titular) over Harvard University, since the last year or two; that is itself a signif<hi rend="italic">t</hi> fact.&#x02014; Well, all this, <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> &#x000A3;450 addit<hi rend="italic">l</hi> income, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be yours if you like; all this, all this and nothing or little more, I take to be the <hi rend="italic">credit</hi> side of the acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> you <hi rend="italic">w</hi>d have to expatriate y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self; and become <hi rend="italic">Yankee</hi>,&#x02014;if at this age<note n="4" noteref="899">Stirling was 48; he wrote: &#x0201C;Were I just as much over thirty as I am over forty, I should not hesitate about it; but all see that it is expatriation for life, and something of an <hi rend="italic">enterprise</hi>.&#x0201D;</note>

<salute>Dear Mrs Phillipps,</salute>
<p>Thank you very much for those Three Photographs you were kind enough to send. They are very beautiful to me; full of old interest, and awaken many tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> and recollect<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>. The miniature by Robertson,<note n="1" noteref="943">Andrew Robertson (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x02013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23784"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Scottish miniature painter; it was probably the miniature reproduced &#x0201C;from a photograph&#x0201D; in Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle Till Marriage</hi>) 1:opp. 336; see 194. For another miniature of Kitty Kirkpatrick, see William Dalrymple, <hi rend="italic">White Mughals</hi> (<date when="2002-00-00">2002</date>) illus. between 398 and 399; a photograph of this miniature by Alfred Edward Chalon (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x02013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5036"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), was later presented to the Carlyle Trust Fund by Catherine Phillipps&#x02019;s grand-da., Mrs. John Williams-Vaughan, and is in Carlyle&#x02019;s House.</note>
 that shadow of the first glance I had of you, in the summer afternoon, 44 years ago,<note n="2" noteref="944">For TC&#x02019;s first meetings with Kitty Kirkpatrick, <date when="1824-06-00">June 1824</date>, see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240610-TC-MAC-01"><sic>3:81</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1824-06-10">10 June 1824</date></corr></ref>, and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 280.</note>
 is splendid! A veritable <hi rend="italic">Indian Princess</hi>, become an English Lady as well,&#x02014;very strangly rises over my poor horizon too!

 still more, the <hi rend="italic">Desk</hi> &#x26;c at Birmingham,<note n="4" noteref="946">The desk was apparently given to TC by Julia Strachey early <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 319.</note>
 of all this, I shall have much to say and ask, if opportunity arise,&#x02014;as you promise. Meanwhile, the Three Photogr<hi rend="italic">hs</hi> (the &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">100&#x02013;years</hi>&#x0201D; are slightly reduced in length) are all going, or <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>, into one little frame; intending to hang in my dressing&#x02014;closet,<note n="5" noteref="947">The three photographs hung on the east wall of TC&#x02019;s dressing-room; see <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x02019;s House</hi> 108.</note>
 and do me what good they can, for the remainder of my time there. Thanks, many!&#x02014;</p>
<p>By some ill chance, y<hi rend="italic">r Address</hi> has fallen irrecoverable at the moment, and I much in hurry: but I will risk on what of Address I can <hi rend="italic">remember</hi>, to assure you thus far</p>

<p>Your gentle, sad and modest gift is mournful and affecting to me.<note n="1" noteref="955">Jane Riddell sent TC a copy of John Riddell, <hi rend="italic">Discourses by the Late Rev. John Riddell. &#x02026; With a Sketch of His Life by the Rev. Andrew Thomson, D.D.</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>); see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681104-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1868-11-04">4 Nov.</date></corr></ref> She compiled the book after her husband&#x02019;s death, <date when="1868-01-13">13 Jan. 1868</date>.</note>
 I received it with thanks, and it shall be among my precious things. Well do I understand your desolate feelings; and what pious beauty was in the noble labours you undertook for the sake of him that is gone;<note n="2" noteref="956">Andrew Thomson explained in his &#x0201C;Memoir&#x0201D; that Mrs. Riddell transcribed the sermons from her husband&#x02019;s shorthand notes: &#x0201C;It is to her heroic application in transcribing his sermons from manuscripts written in shorthand microscopically small, and differing in many respects from the common systems of stenography, that his congregation and friends are indebted for the admirable selection that is contained in this volume&#x0201D; (Riddell xxv).</note>
 the fruit of which is this book, which I doubt not will be a spiritual benefit to many. May it be a blessing to many; as to yourself, I cannot doubt, it has already been! An admirable work; and a difficult, and at last a successful&#x02014;possible perhaps to you alone of the living! I know well what of solacement and sacred assuagement to a bitter sorrow must have been in it,<note n="3" noteref="957">TC was clearly identifying Mrs. Riddell&#x02019;s work with his own on JWC&#x02019;s letters.</note>
 and much approve of your courageous wisdom and still augur well of you. Human sympathy, alas, cannot help; only time and devout reflection&#x02014;and above all strenuous employment in doing what remains to be done. Only once did I see the loved partner whom you have lost;<note n="4" noteref="958">Meeting untraced; however TC sent his &#x0201C;kind remembrances to Mr Riddle&#x0201D; in a letter to John A. Carlyle, <date when="1854-10-13">13 Oct. 1854</date> (see <ref target="volume/29/lt-18541013-TC-JAC-01"><sic>29:168</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1854-10-13">13 Oct. 1854</date></corr></ref>), so it is likely that he met the Rev. Riddell around the time of their mother&#x02019;s death, <date when="1853-12-25">25 Dec. 1853</date>; Margaret A. Carlyle had been a member of the Burgher Church, which became the United Presbyterian Church (see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680626-TC-JHS-01"><corr>TC to JHS, <date when="1868-06-26">26 June</date></corr></ref>).</note>
 <pb id="pg-45-198" n="45:198"/>but I marked deeply in him the features of a faithful, steadfast, and piously high-minded man,&#x02014;as indeed I had been taught to expect by what my dear, sincere, and pious mother often said of him.<note n="5" noteref="959">Thomson noted: &#x0201C;[Rev. Riddell] was singularly wise in directing the thoughts of sufferers and mourners, and in applying suitable medicine for the healing of heart-wounds. This excellence brought him into intercourse with the venerable mother [Margaret A. Carlyle] of the two Carlyles, to whom, in her last years, he paid frequent and welcome visits at her home in Ecclefechan. He found himself repaid manifold for these visits in the conversation of Mrs. Carlyle. She appears to have been a Christian matron of great strength of character; loving her Bible above all books; delighting in the theology of Owen [John Owen (<date when="1616-00-00">1616</date>&#x02013;<date when="1683-00-00">83</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21016"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), theologian], and of those other giant Puritans of the Cromwell period, who combined with the learning of Oxford a piety that was nourished by faith in the profoundest truths of Christianity, and purified and strengthened by the fires of suffering&#x0201D; (Riddell xxv&#x02013;xxvi).</note>
 Your loss, I see how immense it is, and how vain is speech upon it. I will only say, may you have comfort springing from your own faithful, brave, and loving soul, inspired (we may well say) from a higher source. With my grateful regards and best sympathies, Dear Madam,</p>

<p>My distinct impression is that y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> decis<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in the American matter is the right one; that if those terms are secured to you, it will be y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> clear course to go. <hi rend="italic">Philosophic</hi> Scotland, I must say, ought to be ashamed of herself!

But when the confined, smoky, and ill-ventilated condition of the latter is contrasted with the airy, cheerful, and salubrious site now within reach, it is difficult to imagine what possible objection there can be to removal.&#x0201D; John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1868-12-27">27 Dec.</date>, about the Infirmary: &#x0201C;Syme was right in what he said about it; &#x26; it is a thing important for generations of poor people to come.&#x0201D; The original hospital, a hospital for the sick poor, established 1729, was at the corner of Infirmary St. and South Bridge (see 202); it became the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, 1736; buildings in High School Yards and then another fronting Drummond St. were added to it in due course; all are in a more built-up area of old Edinburgh, S of the Royal Mile. Lauriston, not far away, is on the edge of the Meadows, an open area, previously marshland, which had been protected from being built on in an Act of Parliament, 1827; the site of Watson&#x02019;s Hospital, Lauriston Pl., was bought, <date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>, and the new Royal Infirmary was duly built there; it was itself moved, 2003, to a new building in Little France on the edge of the city.</note>

 I feel much obliged by that and by many other proofs of your constant goodwill to me.</p>
<p>As to the &#x02018;Omitted Pieces&#x02019; affair, I find it singular and questionable in all the cases supposable, especially in my own, who am still living and publishing: why drag from their <hi rend="italic">oubliettes</hi> [forgotten places] pieces which the authors themselves have thought worthy to be left there?<note n="2" noteref="995">Shepherd recalled that when he sent the Blake volumes to TC he also asked &#x0201C;permission to print some passages from Carlyle&#x02019;s early, inedited, uncollected or less-known writings&#x0201D; (Shepherd 271) and included with his letter a list, &#x0201C;Inedited and Uncollected Writings of Thomas Carlyle&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1798.26); TC wrote on the list &#x0201C;Shepherd&#x02019;s &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">List</hi>&#x02019; (waits for the <hi rend="italic">remainder</hi>).&#x0201D;</note>
 In short I cannot grant any <pb id="pg-45-205" n="45:205"/>permission, especially of that general kind; and indeed my fear is it may be an unsound adventure for yourself also.</p>
<p>Thursday afternoon, about three p.m., if you appear here, I shall be going out to walk, and will take you with me a part of the way, and hear what you have to say about all that.<note n="3" noteref="996">Shepherd recalled: &#x0201C;At a few minutes before three o&#x02019;clock on that memorable Thursday afternoon, [I] knocked at No. 5, Cheyne Row, and was duly shown up by the housekeeper to Carlyle&#x02019;s study. &#x02026; Here the venerable historian and philosopher was seated at a table, in a long dressing-gown and smoking-cap, in the act of writing&#x0201D; (Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 2:273). They went out walking and Shepherd recalled TC saying that &#x0201C;the perusal of [Shepherd&#x02019;s list] had not been altogether unprofitable to him, carrying his thoughts back to many things and persons in the dim far past&#x0201D; (Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 2:275). He mentioned some pieces which were not on the list, and that he should like a note of them. &#x0201C;It should be mentioned that during this walk Carlyle revoked his former refusal, and gave the writer free leave to print &#x02026; in the forthcoming book.&#x0201D; Shepherd added that he met TC by chance the next afternoon (<date when="1868-12-04">4 Dec.</date>, TC&#x02019;s 73rd birthday) (having been identifying the dates of the missing pieces in the British Museum that morning), &#x0201C;in Church-street, Chelsea. &#x02026; We walked together as far as Palace-gate House [Forster&#x02019;s house], Kensington&#x0201D; (Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 2:278&#x02013;79). TC was presumably going to Forster&#x02019;s to tell him that he and Mary would not come to dinner that day; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681201-TC-JF-01"><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1868-12-01">1 Dec.</date></corr></ref> Shepherd then sent the list of five further pieces, adding birthday good wishes. TC wrote on the envelope: &#x0201C;List of <hi rend="italic">Oubliettes</hi> (from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Shepherd);&#x02014;complete enough; not quite complete; (<date when="1868-12-00">dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1868</date>)&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1798.24). The pieces were not pbd. by Shepherd until he pbd. <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> (<date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>).</note>

 and also for a letter from N&#x000FC;rnberg and one from Rome: all of which ought to have been acknowledged long ago; but for almost three years he has scarcely ever written any letter that was not <hi rend="italic">absolutely</hi> necessary.</p>
<p>His right hand shakes so much that it makes writing a great task to him now.</p>
<p>The weaving of the <hi rend="italic">Lorbeer-kranz</hi> [Laurel-wreath] for him was very pretty. Is it not a pity that such exquisitely beautiful things as flowers so soon fade?!</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I much regret that a Valedictory Speech from me, in pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> circ<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, is a thing I must not think of.<note n="1" noteref="1011">Robertson wrote TC, <date when="1868-12-03">3 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;I have been induced to write to you, in order to know if you will be able to deliver a valedictory address to the students. Mr. Gladstone gave us one, and we fondly hope you will find it convenient to do so as well. Your inaugural address is still treasured up in our memories, and I am sure nothing could give us greater pleasure than once more to listen to your words.&#x0201D;</note>
 Be pleased to assure the young Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, who were so friendly towards me, that I have already sent them, in silence, but with emotions deep enough, perhaps too deep, my loving Farewell; and that ingratitude or want of regard, is by no means among the causes that keep me absent. With a fine youthful enthusiasm, beautiful to look upon, they bestowed on me that bit of Honour, loyally all they had; and it has now, for reasons one and another, become touchingly memorable to me,&#x02014;touchingly and even grandly and tragically;&#x02014;never to be forgotten for the remainder of my life.</p>
<p>Bid them, in my name, if they still love me, Fight the good fight,<note n="2" noteref="1012">See I Timothy 6:12.</note>
 and quit themselves like men, in the warfare (to wh<hi rend="italic">h they</hi> are as if conscript and consecrated) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> lies ahead. Tell them to consult the Eternal Oracles (not yet inaudible, nor ever to become so, when worthily inquired of); and to disregard, nearly altogether, in comparison, the temporary noises, menacings and deliriums. May they love Wisdom; as Wisdom, if she is to yield <hi rend="italic">her</hi> treasures, must be loved, piously, valiantly, humbly, beyond life itself or the prizes of life, with all one&#x02019;s heart, and all one&#x02019;s soul:&#x02014;in that case (I will say ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>), and not in any other case, it shall be well with them. Adieu my y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> Friends, a long adieu,<note n="3" noteref="1013">John A.

I suppose he still lives at Chelsea. His Niagara Pamphlet was almost tragic to me: such a helpless outcry from the Prophet who has so long told us what not to do, but never what <hi rend="italic">to</hi> do. I don&#x02019;t know if he still maintains his Fame at the former height&#x0201D; (A. M. Terhune and A. B. Terhune, <hi rend="italic">Letters of Edward Fitzgerald</hi> [Princeton, <date when="1980-00-00">1980</date>] 3:111). He then sent TC&#x02019;s letter on to another friend, saying: &#x0201C;I enclose you my yearly note from Carlyle. &#x02026; You see that it is growing dusk with him too, and the organ beginning to play out&#x0201D; (Clodd 94).</note>
 I am in my usual weak state of bodily health, not much worse I imagine, and not even expecting to be better. I study to be solitary, in general; to be silent, as the state that suits me best; my thoughts then are infinitely sad indeed, but capable too, of being solemn, mournfully beautiful, useful; and as for &#x0201C;happiness,&#x0201D; I have that of employment more or less befitting the years I have arrived at, and the long journey that cannot now be far off.</p>
<p>Your letter has really entertained me; I could willingly accept twelve of that kind in the year&#x02014;twelve, I say, or even fifty-two, if they could be content with an answer of <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> thanks and friendly thoughts and remembrances! But within the last three or four years my right hand has become captious, taken to shaking as you see, and all writing is a thing I require <hi rend="italic">compulsion</hi> and close necessity to drive me into! Why not call here when you come to town?<note n="2" noteref="1016">FitzGerald lived in Woodbridge, Suffolk.</note>
 I again assure you it would give me pleasure, and be a welcome and wholesome solace to me. With many true wishes and regards, I am always, Dear F., <salute>sincerely yours,</salute></p>

 Thanks, thanks. It is a <pb id="pg-45-210" n="45:210"/>strange wandering meandering Book, like no other I have ever read; but it is full of lively fancies, wise delicate discernments; loyally humane, wholesome, everywhere vividly clear;&#x02014;and there runs thro&#x02019; it (as thro&#x02019; all this Author&#x02019;s Books) a fine vein of<note n="2" noteref="1019">&#x0201C;[O]f&#x0201D; repeated at turn of page.</note>
 gentle real humour, wisdom wearing quietly a pathetic smile;&#x02014;these, I can assure you, are rare and considerable charms!&#x02014; By aid of these and the like, I went thro&#x02019; the big <hi rend="italic">Spanish Conquest</hi> volumes too (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you yielded me some years ago),<note n="3" noteref="1020">Arthur Helps, <hi rend="italic">The Spanish Conquest in America and Its Relation to the History of Slavery</hi>, 4 vols.

 in a right pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and prosperous way; if not always quite sharing the Author&#x02019;s views on cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> minor questions, yet always glad to go with him in his mild lucency, in his perfect clearness of heart and head; and always wishing him cordially good speed in this bad world. I now pray only, May his diligence continue, increasing, not abating.</p>
<p>If it do,&#x02014;perhaps these disastrous Events (of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I never heard clearly till the other day),<note n="4" noteref="1021">Helps&#x02019;s financial problems; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681126-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1868-11-26">26 Nov.</date></corr></ref> Helps replied, <date when="1868-12-15">15 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;Yes: I have had a very fair time of it; and I suppose should have gone clean mad from misery, if I had not had so much to do. &#x02026; However on these matters it is not wise to dwell, though a kind and loving word about them from a dear friend comes very soothingly to one.&#x0201D;</note>
 perhaps these may be only new quickeners in this direct<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and if <hi rend="italic">so</hi>, are not disasters after all, dear Helps, but only blessings in disguise! That, I believe, is verily the truth of the matter; essentially what it means? Bear a hand, at any rate; <hi rend="italic">work</hi> manlike while it is called Today: the <hi rend="italic">wages</hi> one gets, these are a mad thing always, mad especially in this our maddest of epochs; we won&#x02019;t bother ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> these. Some things are for the day, and are eaten within the day; some other things are forever, <hi rend="italic">forever</hi>. Go ahead, I say, with a valiant heart.</p>
<p>If some day you shewed face here ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi>n&#x02019;t it be a glad thing?<note n="5" noteref="1022">Helps wrote: &#x0201C;I will assuredly come &#x26; see you soon. I long to do so.&#x0201D;</note>

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>Above a week ago y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter reached me; a glad arrival, as all y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letters are, communicating various bits of intelligence wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are of interest here. What you report ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Richards<note n="1" noteref="1025">Arthur Henry Richards; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680301-TC-CGD-01"><corr>TC to CGD, <date when="1868-03-01">1 March</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 agrees very well with the rough outline I had formed of him, from physiognomy and a little talk chiefly; an Oxford youth of fair faculty, of honest enough intentions too, but as yet of little real insight into the world or himself, who might be liable to fail from want of discern<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, want of prudence, patience and dexterity, but not much from any worse or deeper want;&#x02014;as accordingly it seems to have proved. Happily he has now got settled on a reasonably good basis, where we hope he will continue, and develope himself,&#x02014;and that both of <hi rend="italic">us</hi> two have now done with him and his affairs. To you, for my sake, he has cost something; to me not much, beyond a little trouble; and, if we have saved a man from London Newspaper <hi rend="italic">Reporterage</hi>, and work in the lowest gutters, into useful Teaching of Languages in Tasmania, neither of us will grudge the bit of help we gave. From Richards himself I have had no word since his last <hi rend="italic">Thank you</hi> at this door; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a symptom I rather approve in him,&#x02014;and certainly wish to <hi rend="italic">continue</hi>, for my own share of it. &#x0201C;Silence is <hi rend="italic">golden</hi>,&#x0201D;<note n="2" noteref="1026">See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 162.</note>
 now &#x26; then, really!</p>
<p>That of &#x0201C;losing a year and half&#x0201D; of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> time and life, in the fruitless attempt to <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> Colonial &#x26; British Anarchy, is not so good! But I suppose you had it to do, by way of satisfying y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own mind and conscience: and I don&#x02019;t wonder you found no bottom; for in fact there is none. I, non-official, have long ceased making any inquiry into these things; Chaos is as big as Cosmos, one feels (or indeed infinitely <hi rend="italic">bigger</hi>), and distinguishes itself moreover by having no centre: give Chaos y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> malison, and leave it alone! That thrice-disgusting Gov<hi rend="italic">r</hi>-Dar?ling<note n="3" noteref="1027">TC&#x02019;s question mark over &#x0201C;Darling.&#x0201D; Sir Charles Darling (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7153"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), army officer and colonial governor; governor of Victoria, <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866-00-00">66</date>, he became embroiled in political controversies; accused of sanctioning financial and constitutional irregularities, he was declared unfit for office and recalled; he resigned, but, in the previous May, he had been allowed to withdraw his resignation and was given a retrospective pension.</note>
 matter I have always skipt away from, when it turned up in the Newspapers, as from extensive carrion in the liveliest state of decomposit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>;&#x02014;most malodorously pointing out to me the state of both the Downing-streets, y<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> and ours.

That is very cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to me. What y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Down<hi rend="italic">g</hi> str<hi rend="italic">t</hi> with its appendages, democracies &#x26;c &#x26;c are, I hope you will thoroughly explain in one of those two Books you are meditating:&#x02014;do; there is no usefuller or worthier employ<hi rend="italic">t</hi> c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be cut out for a thinking &#x26; seeing man who has had Australia under his eyes till he comprehends it. In the name of manhood and honesty, and as a precept to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> essentially out of Heaven, regard that as y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> duty! Ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a year ago I read in the <hi rend="italic">West</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> (by a man whom I have seen and believe) such an Acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Austral<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x0201C;Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x0201D;<note n="4" noteref="1028">Sheldon Amos, &#x0201C;Democratic Government in Victoria,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> 89 (<date when="1868-04-00">April 1868</date>): 480&#x02013;523; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680427-TC-HP-01"><corr>TC to HP, <date when="1868-04-27">27 April</date></corr></ref>. Amos criticized the government of Victoria for its anti-immigration policies: &#x0201C;They have set themselves steadily to dam the stream of life&#x02014;to shut out the outside world&#x02014;to build a wall between themselves and the outer humanity. At present, although a portion of the land revenue was expressly dedicated by a former Parliament to the purposes of immigration, and although the proceeds from the sale of crown lands are strictly speaking part of the immigration fund &#x02026; there is scarcely any effort made to assist immigration to Victoria. In the year <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>, the total number of assisted immigrants to Victoria amounted only to 578 &#x02026; yet there are nearly 170,000 able-bodied paupers now maintained at a great cost by the people of England. / Indirectly &#x02026; it has been the constant aim of the democratic government &#x02026; to discourage the intrusion of people from outside, as well as their industries and the produce of their labour. They have come into a capital estate, in fact, and they see no reason why they should let in strangers to share it&#x0201D; (89:508).</note>
 &#x26;c &#x26;c as refuses ever to go out of mind ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>: that, especially, of no <hi rend="italic">emigr</hi>ts arriving, of its being the wish and &#x0201C;policy&#x0201D; that none sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> arrive, fairly takes away one&#x02019;s breath; challenges the universe to produce its fellow in <hi rend="italic">mal</hi>-gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, ancient or modern, on<note n="5" noteref="1029">Text starting here is taken from printed source.</note>
 this afflicted earth! I entreat you go down to the bottom of all that; and let any clear-minded man understand how it is and what and why.</p>
<p>A visitor (not over welcome)<note n="6" noteref="1030">Unidentified further.</note>
 staggers in; I am driven to this scrap of bare paper as the readiest to hand, for the pretext obliged me to conclude abruptly. You see with what mutinous reluctance my poor right hand writes at all; has been liable to shake of late years (left hand still steady).</p>
<p>I am very sad of soul, but not therefore to be called miserable; nor am I quite idle, working rather what I can, in ways that you would not disapprove of. That you have the intention to come home is good, very good&#x02014;and bring your two books with you.<note n="7" noteref="1031">Duffy visited Europe briefly, <date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>, but did not return for good until <date when="1880-00-00">1880</date>.</note>
 These, I really think, might help against this &#x0201C;millennium&#x0201D; of the devil with the chains struck off <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. I will believe it of you to the last.</p>
<p>&#x0201C;In six years&#x0201D; it seems to me extremely uncertain (and doubtful of advantage, if it were not) whether you will find <hi rend="italic">me</hi> still waiting here to receive you; but, if you do, you can be sure of a welcome from an old man&#x02019;s heart.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear Duffy; I am forced to fling down pen and get out into the air.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-45-213" n="45:213"/>Forster is complaining a good deal&#x02014;not dangerously. Recommend me to Mrs. Callan at the distance of St. Petersburg.<note n="8" noteref="1032">Margaret Callan, Duffy&#x02019;s sister-in-law; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680301-TC-CGD-01"><corr>TC to CGD, <date when="1868-03-01">1 March</date></corr></ref>. Duffy noted: &#x0201C;The reference to St. Petersburg alludes to my answer to some former message to be delivered personally, when I bade him look at the map, and he would see that I was further from Mrs. Callan, then in Queensland, than he was from St. Petersburg&#x0201D; (Duffy 239).</note>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> new Letter of this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>. Before going out into the day of sunshine we happily have, I will write two lines of ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi>,&#x02014;that the bright day may not utterly pass in vain, as too many of my days of late do.</p>

 stones,&#x02014;very unendurable as a walking <hi rend="italic">pavement</hi> withal. That is to say, that his delineat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, besides the bad express<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of it, is with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> or resemblance. He ought to quite give up writing on such subjects; I have hinted to him as much, but some nearer friend might advise him plainly to that effect, if he liked (if both parties liked)! Nothing c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be more absurd to me than the estimate he seemed to make of Browning, Tennyson &#x26;c &#x26;c, as &#x0201C;equal to the highest gods,&#x0201D;<note n="3" noteref="1042">For Stirling&#x02019;s article on Browning, see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681116-TC-JHS-01"><corr>TC to JHS, <date when="1868-11-16">16 Nov.</date></corr></ref> He referred to several other poets, particularly Alfred Tennyson (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x02013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date>; <ref target="volume-45/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27137"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).
