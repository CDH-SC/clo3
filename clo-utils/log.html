<p><place>Chelsea</place>, London, <date>9 june</date><sup><a id="FN1_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN1')" class="tx_sup">1</a></sup> <date>1858</date>—</p><p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>The day before yesterday your Letters came to hand, enclosing, all safe and right, the Draught for £14,<sup><a id="FN2_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN2')" class="tx_sup">2</a></sup> which could not gain admittance in February last!</p>
<p>I give you many thanks; and, truth to say, I am heartily ashamed for all the trouble you have had in this perverse instance. Two Letters now, with such precaution, and a third enclosed (which should have been the <i>first </i>and the <i>only</i>),—all to get me persuaded to take a little money out of your hand!—There is no doubt the mistake occurred at this door; the Letter first sent contains our Postman’s<sup><a id="FN3_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN3')" class="tx_sup">3</a></sup> visible signature with the word “refused“: there is where one hitch was, everybody else has done his part to perfection and with success. One might almost cry and laugh both at once over such a thing. The truth is, this long while back,—young fools being in the habit of bothering me about “autographs“ and other nonsenses, provoking when you have to throw a shilling into the fire along with them,—there has been a standing order that no foreign Letter is to be accepted, if <i>unpaid</i>,<sup><a id="FN4_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN4')" class="tx_sup">4</a></sup> unless the handwriting be known. That is the whole mystery. I no doubt saw that Letter, it would be transiently shewn to me; but I had not the least recognised it; and so (probably in very great haste, and sunk among my own paper-clippings) had negatorily shaken my head; and sent the beneficence home again, in a most astonishing manner, as if it had been a <i>male</i>ficence! Nothing more tragicomical has happened lately. Forgive me, dear Sir, and laugh with me in spite of the trouble you have had: and pray put y<i>r </i>Name on the outside, if in future you dread any such occurrence.</p>
<p>I think I had, once or perhaps twice for a moment, in my head, that some Letter used to come from you about that season of the year, and that none had come: but I mainly concluded, as the whole Finance of America had suddenly gone topsyturvey, that my small deposit in it had sunk among the ruin,—<i>beyond</i> discovery even of Mr Butler for the moment; and that by and by I sh<i>d </i>hear good account of it nevertheless from the said Mr B:—so that in fact I did not think about it at all, or any more than if the Bank of England had stopt payment with it.<sup><a id="FN5_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN5')" class="tx_sup">5</a></sup></p>
<p>And now you inform me there <i>is</i> no halt or stoppage; and in spite of the great earthquake, that small packet lies quiet in its place! I can only say that it is very strange;—and that you must be one of the best Financiers ever heard of. For which I am full of thanks and of wonder.—We had, as you say, abundant tumult here of the same kind; and specimens, I do believe, fully as ugly as any in America: indeed I hear from observers, and it confirms any inspection I have had myself, that for reckless gambling under the name of Commerce, Glasgow challenges New York or any terrestrial City; and that there seldom was such a “Bank“<sup><a id="FN6_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN6')" class="tx_sup">6</a></sup> as that of theirs that collapsed on the late occasion. The more is the pity for Glasgow and the like Cities; and the bigger heaps of gold they gather, the uglier do they grow,<sup><a id="FN7_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN7')" class="tx_sup">7</a></sup>—even while their gold stays with them, which it will not long.</p>
<p>Yesterday, no farther gone, I got <i>done</i> with that First Part of my Book:<sup><a id="FN8_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN8')" class="tx_sup">8</a></sup> you can judge whether it was with a feeling of relief or not. The thing is not to be <i>published</i> till Sept<i>r</i><sup><a id="FN9_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN9')" class="tx_sup">9</a></sup> (season too late now, says the Bookseller): but I am out of it,—still alive, thank Heaven! My Wife, who bids me not forget her regards to you, has again been very weakly thro’ the Winter; and does not seem to take well with the Heat either now that it is come.<sup><a id="FN10_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN10')" class="tx_sup">10</a></sup> My next pressing business now is to get her and myself (myself first I suppose, and into Scotland most likely) fairly <i>out</i> of this Brick Babylon &amp; its tumults, into silent country quarters where we may taste the Summer at firsthand, and see if it will do nothing for us.<sup><a id="FN11_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN11')" class="tx_sup">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The one £500<sup><a id="FN12_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN12')" class="tx_sup">12</a></sup> is invested in <i>Stereotype Plates</i>;<sup><a id="FN13_REF" tabindex="2" onClick="scrollToFootnote('#FN13')" class="tx_sup">13</a></sup> but there is another coming before long, of wh<i>h</i> you may hear!—<p><p>Believe me, Yours sincerely &amp; with thanks,</p></p> T. Carlyle</p>
